<b>                                          REVISED
</b>
                                          December 4, 1986






<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>INT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS - EARLY EVENING
</b>
Winter.  A celebration.  Close friends, cop friends,
family all here to celebrate patrolman MIKE KEEGAN'S
promotion to detective, NYPD.

The party spills through the house -- front room, dining
room, kitchen, with a small fenced backyard visible beyond
that.  A community of cops on their off-hours, their
wives, kids.  A mix of generations, all the way from
MIKE'S kid, TOMMY, and his FRIENDS, playing among the
adults, to an elderly woman observing quietly from her
chair at the side.  The mood's warm, spirited; there's a
lot of friendship here.

ANGLE:  MIKE, in the dining room, posing for a photo with
his ten-year-old son, TOMMY, proudly displaying his new
gold detective's SHIELD pinned to his jersey.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (calling to his
                   wife, for a family
                   portrait)
          Ellie!  C'mon!  Over here!

ANGLE:  ELLIE, MIKE'S wife of fifteen years, a local
product, bright and lively, and clearly proud as hell of
her man.  She frees herself from the crush of friends,
hurrying to join him.

ANGLE:  MIKE, ELLIE giving him a full-mouthed smack on the
lips as he hooks her into his arms.

The picture's snapped, to a chorus of hoots and hollers.
Behind, a banner and poster blowup of Mike in gun and
uniform read:  "FINALLY THEY'VE RECOGNIZED YOU, DETECTIVE
<b>KEEGAN."
</b>
SCOTTY, a patrolman with the 117th and one of MIKE'S best
pals, puts his hand vigorously, in congratulations, on
<b>MIKE'S SHOULDER.
</b>
<b>                         SCOTTY
</b>                  (to Mike)
          No joke?  You're being transferred
          to the 19th as your first
          assignment?  Who the hell loves your
          ass downtown?

<b>                         ROOKIE
</b>                  (naively)
          What's the 21st?

BROOKLYN, a cop about Mike's age, joins in.

<b>                         SCOTTY
</b>          What d'you care?  You'll never know.

<b>                         BROOKLYN
</b>          Manhattan.  The Upper East Side,
          East 59th to 96th.

The ROOKIE stares, impressed.

<b>                         SCOTTY
</b>                  (to the others)
          Remember Curran from the Sixteenth?
          He posted a coupla months there on a
          floater outside the French embassy.
          He met Jackie Kennedy.

<b>                         BROOKLYN
</b>          Curran, that fuckin' noodlehead.  He
          probably wrote her up for letting
          her dog dump on Rockefeller's
          doorstep.

ANGLE ON MIKE, trying to swallow a mouthful of potato
salad as a plump and pretty middle-aged woman (HELEN
GREENING) pulls him into a bear hug, planting a kiss on
him.

<b>                         HELEN
</b>          Mmmmmm-glimmmeee-kisss!  I'm so
          proud of you!  What the hell took
          you so long?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Hey, don't ask me.  Ask the man who
          put in the good word.

ANGLE ON T.J. GREENING, Helen's husband, Mike's best
friend.  He's forty, stocky, looks up, horsing around with
some of the kids in the next room.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          If T.J. didn't push for me, I never
          would've made it.

<b>                         BROOKLYN
</b>          Bet your ass... I give you six weeks
          before you're back on the beat,
          Keegan, they got no room for hero
          cops...

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Appreciate, that vote of confidence,
          Brook.

<b>                         BROOKLYN
</b>          Hey, am I supportive, or what?

ANGLE ON TOMMY:  in the hallway, trying to show SCOTTY'S
date -- a "real" BIMBO, who's spilling out of her woolly
sweater and tight jeans -- how to stand on his SKATEBOARD.
She shrieks a laugh, toppling off.  HELEN, passing by with
an empty platter, catches the action.


<b>INT.  KITCHEN - SAME
</b>
ELLIE, another WIFE at the sink, wives all; HELEN enters.

<b>                         HELEN
</b>          He left Elaine for that?

<b>                         WIFE #1
</b>          And what about little Scotty?

ELLIE continues washing the dishes as HELEN and the WIFE
dry.  MIKE enters to get more beers.

<b>                         HELEN
</b>                  (still staring)
          I'd like to tie her tits together.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          That wouldn't be too difficult.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (overhearing)
          I bet you think she doesn't have a
          brain in her head.  I bet you think
          the only thing he sees in her is one
          incredible, dynamite body...

He GRINS at their blank stares... ELLIE'S EYES wryly
following... as he moves on out with his beers.

<b>                         HELEN
</b>          I love your husband, Ellie, but he's
          a real dork.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Yeah, but he's my dork.

<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  MIKE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Night has descended, PEOPLE talking and laughing quietly,
MELLOW music is playing -- CAMERA FINDING MIKE AND ELLIE,
dancing close, moving sensually.  It's impressive.  HELEN
convinces T.J. to DANCE.  SCOTTY and BIMBO join in too.
T.J., whipped, extricates himself and Helen; tousling
Mike's hair in affection.

<b>                         T.J.
</b>          We're goin'.  Get some sleep,
          Detective Keegan.  You got a new job
          tomorrow.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
MIKE is holding TOMMY asleep on his shoulder.

ELLIE appears, completing the family portrait.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (a whisper)
          Think I should put the skateboard in
          bed with him?

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Too kinky.

MIKE smiles and climbs the stairs.


<b>INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
ELLIE in the bathroom, the door open, she brushes her
hair.

MIKE in bed, thoughtful, a happy man.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Ellie, you know I think it's about
          time we got outa this place, get us
          a house of our own.  We can afford
          it now.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Amen to that.  The supermarket's
          full of assholes.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Take my advice, don't buy any...

MIKE waits for a response.  None comes.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Mike?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (aware of her change
                   in tone)
          What?

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          My ass if falling.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Your what...?

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          My ass is falling.  It is.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (a laugh)
          What are you talking about?

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>                  (appears in the door;
                   stricken)
          I just saw it in the mirror, it
          doesn't look like my ass anymore.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Get in bed.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the
          exercises on TV in the morning...
          gravity...

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          You got a great ass!  I love your
          ass -- now get that falling ass into
          bed before it hits the floor.

She does -- the lights snap put.  They giggle, she MOVING
into his arms.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>                  (a declaration)
          Tomorrow, I start looking for our
          house... You love me?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (deeply)
          You got no idea...

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.

Another muted laugh -- and they move into an EMBRACE,
CAMERA PANNING WITH THEM, and then STILL FARTHER INTO THE
<b>DARKNESS.
</b>
<b>THE DARKNESS HOLDS.
</b>

<b>EXT.  EAST RIVER - (AERIAL) - NIGHT
</b>
... Becoming a darkness pricked with light, as WE FLOAT
over the reflective river, MOVING WEST TOWARD AND OVER THE
<b>CITY.
</b>

<b>EXT.  MANHATTAN - (AERIAL CONTINUED) - NIGHT
</b>
The fabled city, the ultimate object of man's desire and
fulfillment, Oz, the city unfolding itself before and
beneath us, till DAZZLING SHAFTS OF LIGHT sizzling up --
KLEIG LIGHTS -- stab our eyes and bring us down into their
<b>BLINDING BRIGHTNESS...
</b>

<b>EXT.  CLUB - MIDTOWN - NIGHT
</b>
A nondescript piece of rundown city block that's the
hottest thing in town.  PERSONNEL regulate the CROWD and
ARRIVALS.  There is a public line, and from it the young,
hip and outrageous can look on while awaiting entrance at
the formally dressed, stylishly gowned GUESTS arriving at
the private line.

A glittering post-Metropolitan Museum of Art opening gala
is in progress tonight.  The club's private entrance looks
like what it once was, a shuttered porno bookstore, and
the joke's not lost on most of the formal GUESTS, arriving
through the X-rated doorway.


<b>INT.  CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
The latest achievement of money, rock and art.  It's a
breathtaking multi-leveled theater of light, sound and
dance.

There is also an entrance-by-invitation-only grand salon.

<b>ANGLE
</b>
The GUESTS arriving here for the Met gala enter almost in
enchanted procession, each of them being personally
greeted by the primary owner and manager of the club, WIN
HOCKINGS, a charming, rakish ex-preppy.  WIN stands in the
middle of the floor in the throw of a spot, greeting.
This is his element and his club, a son of old money, and
a crossover creature to the fast life.

<b>                         WIN
</b>          Hi... nice to see you... thank
          you... my pleasure...

<b>                         A MET BENEFACTRESS
</b>                  (effusively)
          Thank you so much for agreeing to
          host us tonight.  It's really
          extraordinary!

<b>                         WIN
</b>          Glad I could be of help.

CAMERA MOVING IN ON A NEW ANGLE, CLAIRE GREGORY and NEIL
STEINHART.  The way our CAMERA covers them makes it clear
they are major characters in our story.  NEIL steps
forward to introduce himself, but WIN, looking up, spots
CLAIRE first:  A special beauty and clearly someone very
special to him...

<b>                         WIN
</b>          Claire!

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          Hello, Win.

And he embraces her.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>                  (introducing her
                   companion)
          You know Neil Steinhart?

He grins broadly, taking NEIL'S hand; then right back to
<b>CLAIRE.
</b>
<b>                         WIN
</b>          Of the filthy rich Steinharts?  Why
          is it Claire always connects with
          the richest men this side of Saudi?

<b>                         NEIL
</b>                  (to Win; meaning the
                   club)
          This gives new meaning to the word
          nightlife.

WIN acknowledges the obligatory compliment with a closed
smile, impatiently returning to CLAIRE:

<b>                         WIN
</b>          C'mon, let's get outa this lowbrow
          rag trade...
                  (smiles, cutting
                   Neil out)
          You don't mind, do you?

NEIL stares, polite, as WIN whisks her away; turning, as
he is addressed by someone else coming his way.


<b>EXT.  THE CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
as a BLACK PORSCHE PULLS UP, its dark-tinted window
rolling down TO REVEAL JOEY VENZA.  The MANAGER of the
club comes over to him, with a clipboard list of only the
invitees.

<b>                         MANAGER
</b>                  (a dilemma)
          I'm sorry, Mr. Venza...

VENZA jams the ACCELERATOR to the FLOOR, the CAR burning
rubber like a DRAGSTER as PEOPLE SQUEAL and JUMP OUT of
the way; the CAR fish-tailing away, screeching AROUND the
<b>CORNER.
</b>

<b>INT.  CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
WIN and CLAIRE.  The music, noise, other conversations can
still be heard as they walk through the club.

He smiles, mid-conversation; there's a real affection
here.

<b>                         WIN
</b>          Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them
          since that shitty pasta dinner on
          the cape.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          They've got two monsters now.  Both
          boys.

<b>                         WIN
</b>          And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it
          serious?

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          You didn't like him?

<b>                         WIN
</b>          Looks a little constipated to me.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>                  (needling him)
          It's called "solid"... Nice to find
          someone you can count on, Win.

</b>
<b>INT.  BASEMENT - REAR - ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</b>
VENZA entering, a rush, NOISE and ACTIVITY from the alley
outside; the throbbing new MUSIC overhead.

<b>JOEY VENZA
</b>
Immaculate as always, in a conservatively-cut European
pinstripe, VENZA strides tautly into the shabby corridors.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  MEZZANINE - MAIN BAR - NIGHT
</b>
WIN shows CLAIRE the main dance floor below, sound-filled
and crowded, private and paying GUESTS mixing,
indistinguishable now.  He raises his voice to be heard.

<b>                         WIN
</b>          The main floor stays public.  The
          side rooms we try to keep available
          for special functions like tonight.

He turns and takes her arm.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          It's terrific Win.

<b>                         WIN
</b>          You still writing the occasional
          magazine article?

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          Occasionally.

<b>                         WIN
</b>          Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in
          the basement, you're going to get a
          privileged peek.

He leads her to the freight elevator.

<b>                         VOICE (O.S.)
</b>          Claire!

A sociable FOURSOME descends on them.  It looks like it's
going to be a long conversation.

<b>                         WIN
</b>                  (to Claire, quietly)
          Just press the button all the way
          down when you're ready, okay?

He turns as she's engulfed, heading towards the elevator,
runs into NEIL, CLAIRE'S escort.  NEIL doesn't see her.

<b>                         NEIL
</b>          Where's she go?

<b>                         WIN
</b>          Probably found somebody nicer...
          Kidding.  You're great.

He smiles, entering the elevator and disappearing from
view.  NEIL looking around, with thinly-veiled impatience,
at the benefit-types streaming into the room.


<b>INT.  BASEMENT TUNNELS - NIGHT
</b>
VENZA navigates the labyrinth that connects to the
offices.


<b>INT.  BASEMENT - NIGHT
</b>
The elevator reaches bottom.  WIN exits into an area of
tall rows of stacked boxes still awaiting unloading.
Beyond, a bright, high-ceilinged linen whiteness gleams.

It's a soon-to-be restaurant-gallery area.

<b>THE RESTAURANT GALLERY
</b>
The walls have already been painted white.  Tables have
been positioned.  Chairs are stacked, waiting.  So are
mounds of folded laundry and tablecloths, boxes of
accessories, glass and dish and kitchenware, etc.

Except for FRED, the elderly stock boy, the bright silence
is empty.

FRED scores open the sealed cardboard cartons with a
curved case cutter.  Several tablefuls of unloaded
servers, kitchen utensils, etc., bear witness to the size
of his job.

<b>                         WIN
</b>          You're in overtime, Freddy.

FRED nods, putting down his case cutter, using a side
exit.

WIN, left alone, turns to look up proudly at his
powerhouse modern art collection lining the wall.


<b>INT.  MEZZANINE - NEAR ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
CLAIRE extricating herself; to the foursome.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          I will... I promise...

She smiles graciously and steps into the freight elevator,
pushing the down button.  The doors close.


<b>INT.  BASEMENT TUNNELS - NIGHT
</b>
VENZA approaches an intersection.  Ahead, FRED crosses on
his way to the offices.  The elderly STOCK BOY doesn't see
VENZA, but VENZA sees him, realizing where else to look
here.


<b>INT.  FREIGHT ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
CLAIRE closes her eyes, leaning back against the metal
walls, taking advantage of the refuge for the moment.
Music and crowd noise still vibrate.  The elevator,
shuddering, continues its descent.


<b>INT.  RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
WIN turns in the silence, looking out over the bright
space edged by darkness, every reason to be pleased.

WIN doesn't even hear VENZA enter.

<b>                         VENZA
</b>                  (bear, icily)
          You need money, you come to me.

WIN turns.

<b>                         VENZA
</b>                  (approaching,
                   soundlessly)
          Who the fuck do you think you are,
          raising cash without coming to me?

<b>                         WIN
</b>                  (calmer)
          Your ex-partner... I'm buying you
          out, Joey.  Read the contract.
          There's ample provision.

<b>                         VENZA
</b>          Fuck the contract!


<b>INT.  ELEVATOR - BASEMENT - NIGHT
</b>
The elevator arrives.  The doors open.  CLAIRE steps out
into the shadowed area of stacked rows.


<b>INT.  RESTAURANT - WIN AND VENZA
</b>
<b>                         VENZA
</b>                  (stares, wildly)
          Two years ago you were begging me
          for the money.  Nobody would've
          touched you...

<b>                         WIN
</b>          You're making an eighty percent
          return.  Which is what you wanted.

WIN turn away from VENZA.  VENZA grabs his arm violently.

<b>                         VENZA
</b>          Don't turn away when I'm talking to
          you.

<b>                         WIN
</b>                  (beat with
                   deliberation)
          Grease and water still don't mix,
          Joey.

<b>VENZA
</b>
slashes one of the canvases (A Rosenquist) with the case
cutter... Then another...

<b>ANGLE - WIN
</b>
<b>                         WIN
</b>                  (stunned)
          Jesus Christ... are you crazy?

<b>ANGLE
</b>
Venza slashes another.

<b>                         WIN
</b>          Joey!

<b>VENZA
</b>
turns, slashing WIN.

<b>WIN
</b>
gasps.  Blood begins to seep from his wound.

<b>ANGLE - CLAIRE
</b>
hearing, emerges into the light, smiling, thinking WIN'S
saying something she's supposed to respond to.

<b>VENZA
</b>
slashing WIN again, losing all control.

<b>                         WIN
</b>                  (staggering back)
          Jesus...!

<b>CLAIRE ROUNDS THE CORNER
</b>
Seeing WIN, she stops.

<b>ANGLE
</b>
VENZA continues to attack him, stabbing WIN to the floor.

<b>CLAIRE
</b>
screams, unable to imagine or believe it.

<b>VENZA
</b>
looks up, hearing her.

WIN sprawls, a lifeless, bloodied mass at VENZA'S feet.
VENZA stares, returning CLAIRE'S stare, trying to
concentrate, to focus and pull himself back together.  He
puts down the cutter, taking a step toward her.

<b>CLAIRE
</b>
steps back, turning and moving back toward the elevator,
running.

<b>VENZA
</b>
quickens his step, after her.

<b>ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR
</b>
as she REACHES IT and HURTLES inward, HITTING all the
BUTTONS, the doors beginning to RUMBLE CLOSED.  But VENZA
is there, THRUSTING HIS HAND INSIDE to stop them.  The
doors CLOSE on his fingers.  He cries out, pulling his
fingers free.  He slams his fist against the doors as they
close shut, POUNDS the button again.

<b>ANGLE INSIDE - CLAIRE
</b>
But CLAIRE grabs the POWER SWITCH, pulling it -- the
elevator goes dead, the overhead lights go out -- and
somewhere, in the shaft above, an ALARM BELL begins to
<b>RING.
</b>
Relentlessly, VENZA pounds on the other side of the door.

<b>CLOSE ON CLAIRE
</b>
giving way in the darkened cubicle.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE - CLAIRE
</b>
sagging against the elevator wall, weeping, hearing
VENZA'S FRANTIC BREATHING on the other side subside, and
finally move away in the darkness.


<b>INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The PHONE RINGING -- a hand fumbling on the telephone in
the darkness.  WE HEAR MIKE'S VOICE as he turns on the
light.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          T.J...?  Is this a joke?  Are you
          kidding me?
                  (listening, not
                   liking what he
                   hears)
          Give me 20 minutes.

MIKE hanging up the phone, turns to ELLIE.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>                  (mumbling from under
                   the covers)

          out.

MIKE and T.J. disheveled and tired, drinking out of
styrofoam coffee cups, arriving at the club.

<b>                         T.J.
</b>                  (grinning)
          Hey Mike, out of the bag into the

<b>INT.  THE CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
A rare tableau; swirling disco lights reflecting off
strategically placed mirrors, illuminating a room filled
with POLICEMEN (in uniforms and polyester suits), trying
to ride herd on the BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, in contrasting
attire.

The man in charge and coping is LIEUTENANT GARBER; in
plainclothes, fiftyish, rough-hewn.

<b>                         GARBER
</b>          Did you ever hear the chatter.
          They're worse than fuckin' four-
          year-olds... Miller, let's clear
          this path here, all right?

T.J. and MIKE arrive.

<b>                         GARBER
</b>                  (to them, on the
                   move)
          Blood bath downstairs.  The owner of
          this place is dead.  And I got a
          witness, and a suspect... Joey
          Venza.

T.J. reacts to the name.

<b>                         T.J.
</b>          Where's Venza?

<b>                         GARBER
</b>          Nice question.  I like questions
          like that.

A massive "GASP" goes up from the CROWD as a cumbersome
BODYBAG is brought up a stairwell from downstairs.  GARBER
temporarily moves away to oversee.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (to T.J.)
          Who's Joey Venza?

<b>                         T.J.
</b>          Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families
          dropped him when they found they had
          a fruitcake on their hands.  But he
          knows where a lot of bodies are
          buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if
          he could bring him in.

<b>                         GARBER
</b>                  (returning, re: the
                   crowd)
          Okay, let's find out what we know.
          Herd'm up and check'm out.  Anybody
          know more than gossip about the
          deceased or Venza, I wanna talk to
          them myself.  Go.

T.J. moves into action with typical "T.J. style"
diplomacy.

<b>                         T.J.
</b>          Okay, will all the beautiful people
          shut the fuck up, before it starts
          gettin' real ugly here!

The uniformed COPS take their cue, moving in for quiet.

          Keegan, go baby-sit the witness.
          Just sit and look impressive.  Make

The room is dim, lit only by a desk lamp, CLAIRE seated on
a couch, catatonic, NEIL kneading her hand, trying to
comfort her.  A KNOCK at the DOOR:  NEIL JUMPS UP to open
it -- MIKE ENTERING before he gets there.

<b>                         NEIL

          Are you in charge here?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          No, sir...

<b>                         NEIL
</b>          I asked for the man in charge...

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          That would be Lieutenant Garber, and
          he's very busy upstairs...

<b>                         NEIL
</b>          Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked
          for an ambulance for this woman
          and...

<b>                         MIKE

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>                  (softly)
          No.

MIKE gets his first view of her as she TURNS her head into
the light.  It is an almost storybook vision of beauty
that emerges from the darkness around her; her
vulnerability penetrates to the very core.

<b>                         NEIL
</b>                  (to Claire)
          You're not going to talk to anyone
          without a lawyer.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          She's not a suspect, sir, she's a

          outside, please.

<b>                         NEIL
</b>          No, I will not step outside.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Sir, I am just trying to do my job,
          it's standard procedure to question
          the witness alone.  Help me out
          here, could you please leave.

<b>                         NEIL

</b>                  (quietly)
          Please.

MIKE OPENS THE DOOR for NEIL.  NEIL reluctantly swallows
it.

<b>                         NEIL
</b>          I'll be right outside.

NEIL grudgingly leaves.  MIKE quietly closes the door.

ANGLE CHANGE:  CLAIRE and MIKE alone.  He sits down.  A
beat.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Can I get you a cup of coffee or
          something?

Her plaintive eyes turning to meet his.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>                  (lost)
          I've never seen anyone killed
          before.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          It's okay... I've never been a
          detective before either...

She lifts her gaze quizzically, catching his smile.  She
returns it in spite of herself, disarmed by his frankness,
and curiously reassured.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          We'll go slow.  Okay?  We'll get
          through it together.

PHONES RINGING, TYPEWRITERS TYPING, BODIES moving at

</b>          I don't know how you did it, but

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (puzzled)
          I just sat and listened.

<b>                         GARBER
</b>          Safe and secure is how we want her.
          Until she I.D.'s Venza.

T.J. has joined them.

<b>                         GARBER
</b>          Venza's either going to skip or try
          to get to her and Venza likes it
          here.  I want her ass covered, 24

          I don't understand.  If there's any

GARBER turns back to MIKE

He MOVES ON, leaving them not very happy.

GARBER turns back.

<b>                         MIKE

<b>                         T.J.

<b>EXT.  BACK OF MIKE'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
ELLIE IS SEEN unloading groceries from the rear of a small
hatchback...


<b>INT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
MIKE is in the kitchen; he's making eggs in agitation,
throwing in everything he can find (tuna fish, chopped
pickles, mustard), his kid, TOMMY, in evidence in the
b.g., on a SKATEBOARD, whizzing through the kitchen, even
RIDING IT down the STAIRS.

MIKE MOVES TO A CABINET -- and his FEET GO OUT FROM UNDER
HIM.  He's slipped on a SKATEBOARD -- barely catching
himself in time.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (yelling)
          Tommy!  Goddamnit!  Get these
          skateboards off the goddamn kitchen
          floor!

TOMMY whizzes through, expertly picking it up "on the
move," MIKE taking a futile swipe at him.

<b>                         TOMMY
</b>          What're we having?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          My special, scrambled eggs surprise.

<b>                         TOMMY
</b>                  (frowns dubiously)
          Scrambled eggs surprise?

TOMMY goes whizzing on out again.  ELLIE comes in loaded
up with the groceries.  Puts them down, giving MIKE a
kiss.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          So how'd it go?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Not great.  I've got a babysitting
          job for a material witness on a
          homicide.

It explains his mood.  ELLIE starts putting away the
groceries.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          For how long?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          'Til they pick up the perp.
                  (he sits)
          Seniority gets day shift... You know
          what that means.

CLOSE ON ELLIE:  she sits, realizing, upset, but taking it
in stride, now putting plates on the table.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Well, I'll live with it, I've lived
          with it all my life.  My Dad was a
          cop, he said, "whatever you do,
          honey, never go out with a cop".
          So, what did I do?  I got a job with
          the cops.  Then I married a cop.  I
          probably gave birth to a cop.
                  (shouting)
          Tommy!  Come over here and eat, it's
          hot.

TOMMY enters.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Maybe you and Tommy should stay with
          my Mom.

ELLIE makes an expression of dislike.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Don't start... The only reason is
          that the neighborhood's shi...
                  (realizing that
                   Tommy is listening)
          ... crummy.  I just don't like the
          idea of leaving you alone here at
          night.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          I can still use a gun.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Just keep it someplace safe, but
          handy.

TOMMY joins then at the table.

<b>                         TOMMY
</b>                  (zooming in)
          Keep what handy?

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Nothing.

<b>                         TOMMY
</b>          The gun?  It's in the upstairs
          closet.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          How do you know where the gun is?

<b>                         TOMMY
</b>          I know where everything is.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Except the goddamn skateboards,
          which are everywhere!  I'd like to
          kill the guy who invented those
          things.

<b>                         TOMMY
</b>          Lay back, Mack.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay
          back, Mack?"
                  (to Ellie)
          Where does he get this?

Silence; they eat... ELLIE'S eyes finding MIKE'S.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Keep the weekends for us, huh?  Get
          a replacement for Saturday nights.
          That'll give us the weekends
          together.

TOMMY'S face screws up, tasting the lump of food in his
mouth.

<b>                         TOMMY
</b>          God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?!
          These are pickles...!  God!

<b>                         MIKE

<b>EXT.  MANHATTAN - FIFTH AVENUE - EARLY EVENING
</b>
Mike emerges from the subway alongside the park.


<b>EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDINGS - EARLY EVENING
</b>
Out front, the DOORMAN opens the door for the building's
children returning from music lessons.

Across the street in Central Park, handsome, elderly
tenants stroll in the company of their nurse:  a nanny
pushes a pram, taking advantage of the last light.  This
is one of New York's most exclusive co-ops.  Distilled
civilization and quiet wealth.  A world away from Queens
or anything else.  MIKE arrives on foot.


<b>INT./ EXT.  LOBBY - EVENING
</b>
A notice behind the locked front door informs:  "ALL
VISITORS MUST BE ANNOUNCED".  MIKE displays his shield to
the DOORMAN through the glass.  The DOORMAN opens, taking
the time to inspect his credentials before returning them,
then STEPS ASIDE, allowing ENTRY.


<b>INT.  ELEVATOR - SAME
</b>
MIKE rides up in silence, examining the ornate walls.


<b>INT.  VESTIBULE - CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME
</b>
The elevator delivers him.  MIKE finds himself in a wall-
papered trompe l'oeil foyer.  Nothing to get his bearings.

The front door clicks open, startling him.  MARY, the
cleaning lady, an older, capable woman in functional
civilian clothes, greets him matter-of-factly, taking him
in.


<b>INT.  CLAIRE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME
</b>
Marble-floored and high-ceilinged, absolutely palatial;
MIKE'S EYES registering amazement as he's led inward.

Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Central Park, where
the VOICES are REVEALED belonging to GARBER, T.J., CLAIRE,
and CLAIRE'S boyfriend, NEIL -- who's trying his best to
be "in charge".

<b>                         GARBER
</b>                  (approaching Mike)
          You remember Detective Keegan?

</b>                  (expressionless)
          I do.

The doorbell RINGS AGAIN:  MARY goes to answer it as MIKE
mumbles his greetings to all -- noticing that CLAIRE,
reclining on a couch, seems extremely put out -- or is it
"disinterested"?

<b>                         NEIL
</b>          I want to make sure that everyone
          respects the privacy of Miss
          Gregory's household.  You're limited
          to the outer vestibule, so you can
          watch the elevator, the kitchen, so
          you can get something to eat, and
          the washroom.

<b>                         T.J.
</b>                  (under his breath to
                   Mike)
          So you can take a shit.

The THIRD DETECTIVE enters, being led by MARY.  It's
KOONTZ, a package of razz and sarcasm, somebody you
definitely don't take home to mother.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (reacting; to T.J.)
          Not Koontz.

<b>                         T.J.
</b>          Be happy.  He's good at this.

<b>                         GARBER
</b>                  (to Neil)
          We'd like to, just once, get a look
          at the entire layout, so we can
          evaluate security.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          This really isn't necessary.  The
          security in this building is about
          the best in the city.

<b>                         GARBER
</b>                  (ever the diplomat)
          I'm sure you're right, Miss Gregory,
          but I'd consider it a favor if you'd
          let us look around.

check.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (to Garber)
          What about when she goes out?

<b>                         GARBER
</b>          Discourage it.  But stay with her if
          you can't.  Call it in first so we
          can have a car on tail.  She's
          agreed to travel only with her own
          driver and limousine... okay, let's
          check it out.

They split up.

<b>ANGLE - MIKE

following orders, continues down the hall.  He moves to a
door that he ATTEMPTS TO OPEN -- discovering it's not
real.  It's a TROMPE L'OEIL.  He turns around to find he's
not alone in the long hall.  NEIL stands just outside the
living room, watching him.

<b>                         MIKE

<b>INT.  CLAIRE'S POWDER ROOM

There's an enormous circular bathtub and a Jacuzzi,
endless mirrors, a writing desk, carpeted, a place one
could spend one's life in -- MIKE SEEN, in the MIRRORS,
wandering through -- idly pushing a mirrored door open, to
gaze, in awe, at the walk-in closet.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (under his breath)
          Fuckin' A.

ANGLE:  He see T.J., or what he thinks is T.J., reflected
among the other reflections at the other end of the room.
Sees T.J. sit on edge of bed.  MIKE is standing in center
of the MIRRORS, slightly disoriented.  And T.J. sees him,
similarly astounded, MOVING OUT OF SHOT.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  Moving inward, he gawks at the racks of
clothes, gently brushing his hand through the lush
fabrics.  CLAIRE'S VOICE -- ANGRY, ALMOST TREMBLING, A
FIRM EFFORT OF WILL -- rustles the silence behind him.

<b>                         CLAIRE

MIKE:  chastened, nods.

<b>                         MIKE

He starts away.  MOMENTARILY baffled by the MANY-ANGLED

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          Straight ahead.

<b>INT.  CLAIRE'S OUTER VESTIBULE - NIGHT

All silent; MIKE on "watch".  Just him and a wooden desk
chair, the grade-school variety.  No books, no crossword
puzzles; he came unprepared.  He checks his watch and
looks to an ornate wall clock.  And he's bored.  He picks
up an empty coffee cup, looking for a last drop.  Settles
for sniffing it.  Replaces it on the floor beside him.
Then he looks to the closed doors of the apartment and
makes a decision.  Picking up the coffee cup, he quietly
pushes the DOORS OPEN, and ENTERS.

<b>INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

As MIKE pads quietly across the marble floors in the
quiet; pausing to gaze, in awe, at the vast, empty LIVING
ROOM.  It is gigantic, his eyes roaming the ceilings, as
though to estimate their height.

Moving inward, his eyes fall on a BOOK RACK, and he
crosses to it, perusing the shelves for possible reading
material.

They're all ART BOOKS, the big, thick kind.  A Renoir,
because of a NUDE FIGURE on the cover, catches his eye.
But as he pulls it out and begins to leaf through -- he
HEARS VOICES.  CLAIRE'S and NEIL'S; her tone is agitated.

<b>                         NEIL (O.S.)

is a suitcase in front of it, ready for travel.

          it...

<b>                         NEIL
</b>          Win made his choices, Claire.  We
          all do --

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          And I'm making mine.

She looks at him; a beat, emotionally.  He remains steady.

<b>                         NEIL
</b>                  (gently)
          You're dealing with a psychopath.
          He gets out of jail in ten years, or
          five... or ninety days, and you'll
          be looking over your shoulder for
          the rest of your life...

<b>                         CLAIRE

          one of my oldest friends get killed!
          And I saw who did it!
                  (through tears)
          I can't just -- "let it go away"!!

<b>                         NEIL
</b>                  (gently)
          Claire...

ANGLE - DEN.  NEIL takes her in his arms, holding her
tightly, affectionately, protectively.  Holding her from
behind, NEIL KISSES CLAIRE gently on her neck.  She calms
in his arms.

RETURN:  MIKE DODGES back quickly, through the living and
dining rooms until he's in the kitchen.


<b>INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
Spotting the microwave, MIKE QUICKLY TOSSES in an English
muffin -- peering at the dials, as he switches it on.

But he hasn't escaped being a trespasser to what's going
on in the far room.  He can still HEAR THEM, though HE
WHISTLES, trying not to.

The English muffin BURSTS INTO FLAMES, MIKE desperately
pulling it out, tossing it into the sink, feverishly
fanning the air.

ANOTHER ANGLE ON MIKE:  becoming aware that HE'S NOT
ALONE.  He TURNS SUDDENLY to see MARY, the housekeeper,
not ten feet from him, in the laundry room, coat on,
fluffing her collar, ready to go home.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (chagrined)
          I like 'em toasty.

ANGLE ON MARY:  staring at him, amused.

<b>                         MARY
</b>          Good night, Mr. Keegan.

She moves through the kitchen and EXITS.


<b>INT.  VESTIBULE - LATER - NIGHT
</b>
NEIL, with his briefcase, finally leaving.  He crosses
from the hallway.

The TWO EYE EACH OTHER:  MIKE attempting a cordial smile.

<b>                         NEIL
</b>          You're here 'til what time?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.

NEIL noticing the Renoir.

<b>                         NEIL
</b>          When you're through with it, put it
          back, please, exactly where you
          found it, and don't use the library
          again.  I have to leave town for a
          few days.  Let's do everything we
          can to make this less of a trial for
          her, shall we?

MIKE NODS.  But when NEIL leaves, he makes a mock
"military salute"; a click of the heels.

<b>INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - LATER
</b>
2:45 A.M. (the clock ON THE WALL); pindrop silence; MIKE
alone.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  thoughtful, leafing through the Renoir.
Like a man making the most of solitary confinement --
becoming aware of a NOISE.  Though hard to make out in
this windowless capsule, it is DISTANT THUNDER.  It stirs
life in him and his eyes wander reflexively upward,
studying the ceiling -- then the doors of the apartment,
left slightly ajar.

ANGLE INSIDE THE APARTMENT:  CAMERA FOLLOWING MIKE as he
wanders inward, becoming aware of light coming from a
drawing room.  HE MOVES TOWARD, STOPPING.

ANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE, dimly illuminated by the
light of a desk lamp that throws a gentle glow around her
-- seated, still as statuary, gazing out into the rain.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  watching her.

The uncivilized hour indicated by the TOTALLY EMPTY
SUBWAY, MIKE a lone figure, somewhat numbed, his eyes set
into distant space -- as the SUBWAY reaches its
DESTINATION, the blurry platform signs decelerating until
we can make out the word "QUEENS".


<b>EXT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS

The neighborhood still asleep in the predawn hour; MIKE
picks up the newspaper... glancing at it, he opens it,
sees an article and photograph of CLAIRE on the second
page.  He heads inwards...

<b>INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Afternoon sunlight SPILLING IN as MIKE AWAKENS to the
SOUND of a CAR MOTOR, faltering, then "chug-chugging" to
another start, gasping, then revving.  Someone's working
on MIKE'S car.  He looks at his alarm clock; it's 4:00 in
the afternoon.

<b>                                            CUT TO:

<b>EXT.  MIKE'S BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
ELLIE and TOMMY visible only as fragments as they work on
MIKE'S car.  ELLIE IS SEEN as a rear-end in blue jeans,
the rest of her inside the hood; she calls to TOMMY to
"try it again".  It looks like no one's behind the wheel;
but the very top of his head CAN BE SEEN as he strains to
reach the accelerator.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  appearing at the door, in a freshly
pressed suit, a steaming cup of coffee in hand.  He walks
across the lawn towards them.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Hey!  What the hell're you doin' to
          my car?

ELLIE emerges from underneath the hood, flushed.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Changing the sparks.  They showed it
          on TV.  What d'you think?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I think television's a dangerous
          thing.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          It's twenty bucks in the bank.

Slamming the hood.  TOMMY revs the engine ELLIE moving
down the steps towards MIKE.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Enough, Tommy!  C'mon.  Get out of
          there!

ELLIE moving towards MIKE, she slipping her hand into his
underpants:  Their eyes meet, lovingly.  She laughs.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Hey.  The neighbors.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Let 'em eat their hearts out.

She retrieves her cold coffee cup from the POTTING TABLE,
checks out the picture of CLAIRE in the newspaper, he's
left there.  MIKE adjusts his tie.  It's very colorful.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          I read the article.  You didn't tell
          me she was so beautiful.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (Mister Honest)
          Well, actually, she looks better
          than that.

ELLIE playfully makes a move, JABBING AT HIM, MIKE stops
her, ending WITH A HUG.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I've got to go.

MIKE kisses her.  ELLIE holds MIKE'S face with her gloved
hand.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          See you Tommy.

ANGLE ON ELLIE:  as TOMMY comes up and leans against his
mom:  both watching MIKE primp, they share on the joke.
MIKE turns, his face with grease on it.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Okay?

<b>                         ELLIE

</b>          Nice threads Dad.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Yeah, I think so.

MIKE leaves.


<b>INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - LATER - NIGHT
</b>
The WALL CLOCK reads 6:30.  The remains of a teeny gourmet
meal, before him on the kitchen table.

MIKE is playing an improvised hockey game, shooting peas
through a goal made up of two water glasses, using his
knife as a hockey stick.  He HEARS the CLICK of HIGH HEELS
approaching, crossing the vast marble floors.

ANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE coming toward -- clearly
dressed for the evening, her stride signaling
determination.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (brilliant)
          Hi.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this
          works.  I have to go out... is that
          all right?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (unprepared)
          Uh...

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          I have to pick something up before
          Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a
          reception just a few blocks away.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (faltering)
          I think, maybe, that isn't such a
          great idea...

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          Lieutenant Garber said that in all
          likelihood there was no real danger,
          is that true?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Right.  That's true.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          Can we go then?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I'm supposed to call in.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          There's a phone in the car.

She MOVES TOWARDS THE ELEVATOR:  MIKE, stymied.


<b>INT.  ELEVATOR - SAME - NIGHT
</b>
They descend in silence, MIKE aware of being scrutinized.
The ELEVATOR STOPS, MIKE about to get off, realizing
they're stopped at the THIRD FLOOR, another TENANT
stepping on.  He's dressed in an expensive JOGGING SUIT,
his key dangling from around his neck; he nods to CLAIRE
and pushes "DOWN".  The elevator RUMBLES downward.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          Do you have another tie?  Something
          more conservative?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (confused, then
                   realizing)
          Oh... Yes... I don't have it with
          me.  It's at home.


<b>EXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - SAME - NIGHT
</b>
The JOGGER first out the door, taking off with fierce
determination, followed by MIKE, who nervously checks the
street, then opens the limo door and checks inside, then,
finally, MOTIONS CLAIRE OUT.  She moves smoothly into the
limo; MIKE checks traffic behind them, then gets in,
after.

          I don't see that we have much
          choice.  Jesus Christ.  Tell her
          she's a fucking lunatic.

GARBER slams down the phone.


<b>INT.  CLAIRE'S LIMO - NIGHT

MIKE sets down the phone.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          What did he say?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          He thinks you're being a little
          careless.  He made the point several
          times.

MIKE sets down the phone.  They settle back; trying to
feel "comfortable" in one another's presence.  It's plenty
awkward.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          You live in Manhattan?

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          My father founded a music school
          there.  The Milton Gregory School.

He politely tries to place it, with no idea.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          I'm supposed to speak at their tenth
          anniversary.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have
          an aperitif...

It evokes a slight smile but nothing more.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Maybe not.

The limo pulling up, MIKE hopping expertly out before it
stops moving.

It's parked in a red zone, with tow-away signs everywhere;
a PATROLMAN notices from the curb.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (to the driver)
          Don't move it.

He flashes his shield at the PATROLMAN, takes a firm grip
on CLAIRE'S elbow, guiding her in.

<b>ANGLE - AT THE ENTRANCE DOORS
</b>
MIKE stiff-arms the revolving door, stopping outgoing
shoppers to clear the way for CLAIRE; hops over to the
fixed door, opening it quickly for her, hustling her
effortlessly in, zip.

ANGLE:  CLAIRE, taken by it, but not displeased.


<b>INT.  FIFTH AVENUE SHOP - NIGHT

going.

<b>                         PERFUME LADY

CLAIRE steps onto the ESCALATOR; MIKE on alert,
scrutinizing the crowd.  He gets on right behind.  They
ascend.

At the top LANDING, A DARK-SUITED MAN VEERS RIGHT INTO
HER.  CLAIRE flinches.  MIKE MOVES PAST HER to the front,
quickly handling the guy.  The MAN jumps back.

<b>                         DARK-SUITED MAN

look, too.

CLAIRE walks past MIKE.

<b>                         CLAIRE

MIKE follows her.

CLAIRE at the TIE COUNTER, points to the tie rack.

MIKE begins to connect, glancing down again at the tie
he's wearing.  CLAIRE selects a TIE, turning to the
SALESPERSON, for his reaction.

He looks down at it in silence; then, finally:

CLAIRE steps out, utterly elegant, taking MIKE'S arm --
the traffic COPS now joined by those from the BLACK-AND-

MIKE and CLAIRE caught in a crush of people jamming the

close that MIKE is forced into an awkward posture in order
to stay close to her; one arm up in the air, uncomfortable
about taking her arm.

<b>                         CLAIRE

She looks up to SEE MIKE:  it directs others to do the
same.

          Hello...

                   to Antonia)
          ... Ma'am.

</b>                  (liking him; to
                   Claire)
          He's got nice eyes.  Very gentle.
                  (re: Mike's
                   embarrassed
                   reaction)
          And he blushes.  I like that.  Take
          good care of her.


<b>INT.  THE RECEPTION - LATER - NIGHT
</b>
CLAIRE in the thick of things -- a BAND PLAYING NOW --
occasionally glancing at MIKE -- who stands against a
wall, ever watchful...

CLOSE ON MIKE: TURNING to see a VERY PRETTY YOUNG THING
come up to him; just "oozing" seduction.

<b>                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
</b>          I hear you're a policeman.

MIKE nods; eyes fixed on CLAIRE.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.

<b>                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
</b>          Ever shot anyone?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Yes.

<b>                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
</b>          Does it make you... hard?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          ... Hard?

<b>                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
</b>          Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd
          heard that it gives you a boner, to
          shoot a man.

MIKE'S eyes register abject dumbfoundment.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Would you excuse me, please?

HE PUSHES TOWARD CLAIRE, catching her eye.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Would you consider leaving here
          pretty soon?

CLAIRE relaxed, clearly having a good time.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          People think I'm stepping out on
          Neil.  We're causing quite a
          scandal.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (confidential)
          Hey!  There are crazy people here.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          Let's get a drink.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.

She plows toward the crowded bar, just inside the ballroom
entrance, MIKE following.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          I'll have a spritzer, order
          something soft for yourself... I
          must go for a pee.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I'll come with you.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          I think I can probably do that on my
          own.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  Not amused.  CLAIRE heads to the ladies'
room across from the bar.  MIKE watches her enter.  Turns
back to the bar, which is very busy and confused.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (irritated)
          Gimme a spritzer, and a... vodka
          martini.

MIKE seeing the Pretty Young Thing.

as a pair of WOMEN finish their "touch-up" and head out,

herself.  The room momentarily empties.  Putting her purse
down she moves to a stall and enters.

LOW ANGLE on the door -- as a pair of men's shoes pass
through frame.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE, inside a stall SHE HEARS FOOTSTEPS
QUIETLY ENTER, followed by a CLICK of a DOOR.  It's not
the click of a stall door, because the FOOTSTEPS then
proceed inward; WE HEAR A STALL DOOR CLOSE and LOCK.  It
gives her momentary pause, but she dismisses it, looking
for her purse -- realizing she left it on the sink --
opening her stall door and heading out.

She barely hears the "click" of the bolt sliding behind
her -- and looks up, into the MIRROR, SEEING VENZA appear
behind her.  She SPINS -- but doesn't have time to CRY
OUT.  He's grabbed her by the THROAT.

MIKE and the PRETTY YOUNG THING:  she doesn't notice him
trying to drift away.

<b>                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
</b>          You know what?  I don't think you're
          a policeman at all.  I think you're
          just some schmuck who uses that
          "policeman" line as a come-on.

CLAIRE attempting to breathe -- her FACE being brought to
within an inch of his.

<b>                         VENZA
</b>          Christ, you're one beautiful woman.
          I could kill you right now, but I'm
          not gonna... 'cause you're gonna
          help me.  You're gonna see me in a
          police line-up and say it wasn't me.
          And if you don't do that, someone
          will come after you.  They're gonna
          find you dead, with your face
          missing -- understood... Good...
          Because otherwise, it'd be this
          easy.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE:  her eyes wide with TERROR.  He rubs his
thumb across her mouth, smearing the lipstick.

<b>                         VENZA
</b>          Now walk outta here.  And if you
          ever see me again... you never saw
          me before.

To make his point, he SQUEEZES HARDER -- CLAIRE'S eyes
bulging, as TEARS run from her eyes.

</b>
MIKE, finally putting distance between him and the "PRETTY
<b>YOUNG THING."
</b>
ANGLE:  MIKE, as he catches sight of a back of a man
(VENZA) moving out of the ladies' room.  Stunned, MIKE
PIVOTS, TURNING, SPRINTING IN THE DIRECTION of the ladies'
room.

OUTSIDE THE LADIES' ROOM:  Two women just go in.  MIKE
pushes his way in, slamming the door behind him.  The
OTHER WOMEN GASP, seeing MIKE invading their sanctuary.

<b>INSIDE THE LADIES' ROOM:  MIKE
</b>
CLOSE ON MIKE:  RELIEVED BUT SHOCKED to see CLAIRE,
disheveled, lipstick smeared across her mouth, throat and
face, but otherwise uninjured.

MIKE turns, calling to the TWO WOMEN coming in.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Take care of her!

<b>MIKE TAKES OFF AFTER VENZA --

</b>
<b>OUT OF LADIES' ROOM, AND UP THE RAMP TO THE NEAREST (THE
</b><b>UPPER) LEVEL.
</b>
ANGLE:  He sees VENZA get into the ELEVATOR.  These is
only one place for it to go -- DOWN.  MIKE CHANGES
DIRECTION and FRANTICALLY RUNS DOWN THE SPIRALING RAMP
trying to keep pace with the descent of the elevator.  At
the GROUND LEVEL HE SEES THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and VENZA
<b>EXITS AMIDST THE PARTY.
</b>
<b>ANGLE ON VENZA:  VENZA MAKES HIS WAY TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE

<b>ANGLE ON MIKE:  MIKE HURTLES DOWN THE RAMP AND DESPERATELY
</b>FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH THE CENTER of the PARTY and OUT the
<b>FRONT ENTRANCE.

MIKE EXITS the BUILDING bewildered; lost him... RUNS
BLINDLY amidst PEDESTRIANS -- SPOTS VENZA AHEAD.

ANGLE ON VENZA reaching someone MIKE CAN'T SEE.  MIKE puts
his hand in his jacket for his gun.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Venza!

VENZA HEARS and SLOWS, but DOESN'T TURN.  ONLOOKERS turn.
VENZA is talking to someone, taking his time.

ANGLE ON VENZA:  untroubled, turning; raising his arms,
and SMILING.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  confused -- seeing that the man VENZA
stopped to talk to is a PATROLMAN, he'd stopped to give
himself up.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  breathless as he moves toward VENZA.  MIKE
frisks VENZA as he turns, SMILING at MIKE.

<b>                         GARBER
</b>          You apprehended him after he gave
          himself up --

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave
          himself up because he knew I was

<b>                         GARBER
</b>          Anyone who turns himself in makes a

<b>                         GARBER
</b>          He's got a good lawyer, and he made
          a smart move.  We've got a scared
          witness and a suspect who proved
          "good will" by turning himself in.

<b>                         MIKE

<b>                         GARBER

          hope she identifies him.

GARBER turns on his heel, ENTERING HIS OFFICE; leaving
MIKE looking at T.J.  Dismayed.

A tree-lined neighborhood.  The house has a FOR SALE sign
in front; MIKE is standing in front of a cab, he's dressed
for work -- he looks around.  The cab pulls out, he heads
for the front door.


<b>INT.  TRACT HOME - AFTERNOON
</b>
MIKE enters the house.  It's nothing special.  ELLIE is in
another room.  She joins MIKE.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          The real estate lady left, she
          couldn't wait anymore.  What took

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (upset)
          Oh, some shit.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          What shit, honey?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          You don't want to hear about it.

ELLIE begins to show him the place.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          ... Look at the fireplace.  You
          don't get workmanship like that
          anymore.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  preoccupied.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Ninety-seven five.  What do you
          think?

He nods, trying hard to "be there," but ELLIE isn't
fooled; she assesses him with concern.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Honey.  You got him.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I don't know that Ellie.  He might
          get out.  Garber's not bein'
          straight with the witness, she could
          be in deep shit if she identifies
          him, and it's my job to convince her
          she won't be.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>                  (the voice of

          She's got to identify him.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Why?

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>                  (taken aback)
          Because the the only way to stop
          crime is to identify criminals.  I
          can't believe you're talking this
          way Mister Detective -- I think
          she's got a lot of guts.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I think -- she's crazy.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          I'd identify him.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I might stop you.

A beat.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Oh I can see you've had a bad day.
          We'll see the house another time,
          okay?

<b>                         MIKE

<b>                         ELLIE

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (distracted)
          Bought it.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          It's not your taste.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          What did she say the down payment
          was?

<b>PAUSE.  DEAD SILENCE.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          She didn't like the other one, so

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          She took you shopping for a tie?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I had to follow her to a store.

<b>                         ELLIE

<b>                         MIKE

<b>                         ELLIE

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          I know you're her bodyguard.  Did
          she buy it or did you?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          She bought it.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Why?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I don't know why she bought me a
          tie! -- She's a generous person --
          and she's a nice person -- and I
          could be settin' her up to be
          killed... you want the fuckin' tie?

His VOICE resonates through the empty house, creating a
ringing silence.  ELLIE begins to giggle.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>                  (joking)
          No, I don't want the 'fuckin'" tie
          -- I'm sorry --
                  (conciliatory)
          I'm glad she bought you a tie.  You
          needed one.  You look good in that
          tie.
                  (a beat)
          Next time you two go shopping, maybe
          you could tell her we need a new
          Maytag stackable, double-decker
          washer and dryer set.

MIKE smiles, she gives him a kiss, and a flick on the
nose.

The WALL CLOCK reads 9:45.  CLAIRE is working at her desk.
She gets up and moves into the hallway where she sees MIKE
through the half-opened door.  CLAIRE moves to the
doorway.

<b>                         CLAIRE

          here.

An awkward silence.

<b>                         MIKE

          I shouldn't have listened to you, I
          should've followed you right into
          the "can" the way he did.

<b>                         CLAIRE

          company, he was right next to me.  I
          think he heard me peeing!  I hate
          that, I am glad he's in jail.

it.  But it's hard to make light of; the attempt quickly
fades.

over his shoulder to see.

ridiculous awkwardness.

She steps out first, he follows.  She moves to the doors
and stops -- her shoulders visibly relaxing as he moves up
behind her.  But he stops, too.  And she turns.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  Both captive to indecision.  It is he who
makes it, just by staying immobile for too long.  She
smiles and takes off her coat, holding it out to him.  And
in the moment of exchange is the return to reality.

NEIL catches MIKE'S glance at her; reassures himself with
a glance at CLAIRE, straightens, still steamed from last
night.

GARBER picks up on it, not liking the tension, especially
not now; his eyes throw daggers at MIKE.

She does it to TOMMY, too, except he's too fast for her,
yelling and squirming out of the way.  The PHONE RINGS.
ELLIE doesn't answer it.  TOMMY picks it up.

<b>                         TOMMY
</b>                  (a beat)
          Wait a sec.

He offers the phone out to ELLIE.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Hello.
                  (a beat)
          Yes, just a second.
                  (hands it to Mike)
          It's the Whip.

MIKE takes it.  ELLIE turns to TOMMY, who yelps and darts
away, avoiding her cold touch.

<b>                         MIKE

          What?!
                  (to Ellie)
          Venza's out.
                  (back to phone;
                   pissed)
          Why didn't the I.D. unit or the
          D.A.'s office know about his sheet?
                  (a beat)
          Ah shit... Yeah, yeah, okay I'm on
          my way in.

He SLAMS DOWN THE PHONE, raging.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          What?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi
          driver in the Bronx, thirteen months
          ago.  It's coming to court and the
          judge let him walk because of the
          pending case law.

In a fit of RAGE, he SWIPES at a MILK CARTON, sending it
HURTLING AGAINST A WALL.  ANGLE on TOMMY:  amazed.

<b>                         ELLIE

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (distraught)
          It is my fault!  I'm responsible for
          her!

He dumps the rest of the lunch preparations in the sink,
exiting.

The ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and MIKE steps out, breathless,
confronting KOONTZ.  The MUSIC CONTINUES TO BLAST from
behind the closed apartment doors.

KOONTZ grabbing his stuff, massive understatement.

<b>                         KOONTZ
</b>          She's a little upset.  You're going

He holds up a beer bottle; half-filled with urine.

          Sorry, I don't have any extras.
          Have a nice night.

HE WILLINGLY LEAVE, and MIKE WAITS but a split second,
before going to the doors.  They are closed.  MUSIC blares
from within.  No other response.


<b>INT.  CLAIRE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME - NIGHT
</b>
Distraught, CLAIRE tries to bring herself back from the
brink, placing the wine bottle rack down after she's
poured.

<b>                         MIKE (O.S.)

The lock turns and it opens, but just a crack, enough to
see that she's hysterical, her eyes reddened from crying.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          You put me life in danger.

<b>                         MIKE

<b>                         CLAIRE

          I'll have to leave the country!  You
          can't protect me, and you can't keep
          him in jail!  And you knew that all
          the goddamn time!

Near bursting, she SLAMS THE DOOR, leaving MIKE STUNNED:
Inside, the MUSIC is TURNED UP AGAIN to THUNDEROUS
<b>PROPORTIONS.
</b>
Clenching his fists, MIKE PACES in frustration, then SLAMS
his fist against the wall -- NOTICING the door has failed
to FULLY SHUT.

<b>HE PUSHES IT OPEN, ENTERING THE APARTMENT, CAMERA
</b>FOLLOWING HIM as he looks for her.  The MUSIC, bounding
off the high ceilings and marble floors, is thunderous.

she PULLS ON SOME CLOTHES.

<b>                         MIKE

          me?  There must be some kind of
          office pool.  One month?  A couple
          of days?

Their physicality reaches a CLIMAX with MIKE pinning her
against the wall, she, restrained by him, finally GIVING
UP, with a SOB, and COLLAPSING INTO HIS ARMS.

<b>                         MIKE

stops.  She CLOSES THE DISTANCE.  THEY KISS.  They
separate, making sure.  They KISS AGAIN, certain.

ELLIE startles awake, premonitorily.

ELLIE:  She turns in the darkness to look at the clock.
Heart beating, she reclines again, lying awake, realizing
what it was that woke her.  She listens, hearing it again.

A shuffling SOUND, something moving, outside.

She stirs, sitting up, listening.

ANGLE:  Only silence answers.

ELLIE gets up, dissatisfied by the silence, and moves to
the rear bedroom window.

AT THE REAR WINDOW, she looks out into the darkness.

<b>HER POV - BACK YARD
</b>
It's almost impossible to see anything.  Nothing moves.


<b>INT.  HALL/LANDING - NIGHT

ELLIE closes TOMMY'S door, listens again for the SOUND;
starts quietly down the stairs.

ELLIE reaches the ground floor, moving for the kitchen.


<b>INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

ELLIE enters.  She GASPS.  A SMALL SHADOWED FIGURE TURNS,
CONFRONTING HER.  It's TOMMY, having left his room
earlier.

</b>                  (hushed)

They kiss, in affirmation.

his duty.

<b>                         T.J.

together, rising, waiting for the train to stop.


<b>EXT.  MIKE'S STREET - SAME

As MIKE rounds the corner and looks up.  His breath
catches.  His heart starts to pound.

AHEAD, lights ablaze.  ONE COP CAR is in front of his
HOUSE, and a JEEP (Belonging to SCOTTY).  MIKE BREAKS INTO
<b>A RUN.
</b>

<b>INT.  MIKE'S ENTRY - NIGHT - MORNING

He rushes in.  The front door is unlocked, lights are on,
but otherwise there is nothing different.  He hears
<b>VOICES.
</b>

<b>INT.  MIKE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - MORNING
</b>
MIKE hurries in.  The room is bright.  SCOTTY and another
cop, BROOKLYN from the 117th, look up from the kitchen
table, nursing cups of coffee.  BROOKLYN is on duty;
SCOTTY has come over on his own.

TOMMY has long since been ushered back to bed.  ELLIE
making coffee at the stove, turns as MIKE enters.

She is okay, returning MIKE'S stare with embarrassment.

<b>                         SCOTTY
</b>          Calm down, everything is okay.
          Ellie reported a prowler.  Probably
          one of those peepers who've been
          making this neighborhood such a

SCOTTY collects his gun from the table, rising.

          I'll come 'round in the car from

          sleep.  Just keep the shades pulled.

He gives her a peck, yawning.

<b>                         BROOKLYN

SCOTTY waves her off with a goodbye, exiting after
BROOKLYN.  ELLIE turns back to MIKE.

His stare is unyielding.

MIKE sits in a chair by the far wall, staring out toward

OVER THE BED where ELLIE lies asleep.  But as WE MOVE
CLOSE TO HER FACE, WE SEE she is not asleep; wide-eyed,

No response; MIKE having trouble with it.

CLOSE ON ELLIE:  sensing deception.  Her eyes begin to
glisten.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  seeing her distress.  Unable to hide his
own.

She looks at him -- and knowing him as well as she does,
is certain.  She puts a hand in front of her mouth in an
attempt not to cry.

MIKE moves silently, backtracking through the bedroom and
bathroom toward the DOORS leading to the dressing room
ahead.


<b>INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The KILLER passes the door he wants, thinking it's just
another mirror; finds himself in the totally MIRRORED
ENVIRONMENT of the MAIN DRESSING AREA.

On the other side of the door, MIKE HEARS HIM, tightening
his grip on his gun and on the doorknob as he REACHES for
it.  MIKE grasps it, turning and opening the door
silently.  But the latch connects to the light, and the
LIGHT GOES ON OVERHEAD of MIKE.

The KILLER reacts quickly, gun drawn, on the turn.  But he
faces SEVERAL REFLECTIONS OF MIKE in front of him -- and
<b>MIKE IS BEHIND HIM.
</b>
<b>MIKE LEVELS AIM AT HIM.
</b>
<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Put it down!
                  (beat)
          Think about it!

The KILLER takes his chances, WHIRLING.  MIKE FIRES FIRST,
NAILING HIM right through the HEAD.  The KILLER SPINS
AGAIN, SLAMMING UP against the MIRRORS and falling DEAD to
the floor.

IN THE BEDROOM:  CLAIRE wakes.

MIKE:  checking quickly on the dead assassin, flattens
himself against the wall and scurries back through the
bath the way back into the BEDROOM.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (entering, to Claire)
          Get on the floor!  There may be
          more!

CLAIRE does what he says.

MIKE RACES into the CORRIDOR, hugging the wall; he PAUSES
momentarily, then RACES down the HALL.

ANGLE ON THE OPENED FRONT DOOR as he REACHES IT, seeing
T.J.'S CHAIR empty.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (desperate)
<b>          T.J.!
</b>
MIKE RUNS, frantically, into the living room, the
bathroom, the den -- CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM into the
<b>KITCHEN.
</b>
CLOSE ON HIS FACE:  twisting with GRIEF.

ANGLE ON T.J. face down in a pool of blood, MIKE RACING
TO HIM, rolling him over.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (sobs)
<b>          T.J...!
</b>
MIKE moves by REFLEX, starting mouth-to-mouth.  But there
is blood everywhere.

MIKE desperate; pumping T.J.'S chest.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Live, T.J.  Please...!

CLAIRE appears behind him, to help.

</b>                  (to her)
          Get security on the phone!
          Emergency!

She RUNS to the KITCHEN PHONE; it's dead, the WIRES CUT.

She TURNS, HURRYING to the VESTIBULE and THE ELEVATOR,
pulling the alarm, sagging in collapse.  The ALARM goes
off within the shaft, THROUGHOUT the building.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  shirtless and shoeless, on his knees in
T.J.'S blood, desperately pumping his chest.

<b>                         MIKE

MIKE alone on a bench, his head in his hands:  a couple of
COPS we recognize from the Precinct stand a distance away,
at a coffee machine, talking softly as they glance at him.
It is not yet dawn.

FOOTSTEPS are HEARD coming TOWARD; MIKE looks up to see
GARBER APPROACHING, his expression appropriate to the
occasion.  GARBER reaches him; they exchange a long look,
MIKE'S eyes etched with anguish.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (softly)
          They're operating on him.  He's
          still alive.

<b>                         GARBER
</b>                  (grim)
          I heard.

A long pause, as he looks at MIKE.

<b>                         GARBER
</b>          I heard a lot... Anything you want
          to deny, Mike?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (almost inaudibly)
          It should've been me...

GARBER:  aware of his own dilemma.

<b>                         GARBER
</b>          Then it would've been her, too.
                  (beat)
          I don't know... but I gotta protect
          the Precinct, too.  You're on
          suspension, pending Disciplinary
          Hearings.  Don't hold your breath.
          And you're not to go near that woman
          until she's no longer under Police
          protection and this case is closed.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  responding with a silent nod as GARBER
stands looking down at him.

<b>                         GARBER
</b>          Is it "love," Mike?  I hope so.  I
          want it to be worth it, for your
          sake.

No response.

In the response that follows, they HEAR MOVEMENT at the
end of the HALL, looking up to see the silhouetted figures
of ELLIE, with HELEN GREENING in tow.  They look small,
and lost, framed against a floor-to-ceiling window that's
beginning to illuminate with the first light of day.

Heavy with sadness, GARBER turns and heads toward the
women.  Taking a long moment.  MIKE decides not to follow.

<b>CLOSE ON MIKE
</b>
CAMERA STAYS AT THIS DISTANCE as the THREESOME comes
together.  We do not hear their words, but sense the
emotion by what WE SEE.  After a brief exchange of words,
GARBER takes HELEN GREENING under his arm, and they MOVE
AWAY -- leaving MIKE and ELLIE alone.

CLOSER ANGLE:  MIKE and ELLIE, gazing at each other across
the gulf of their collective misery.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          I'm going to visit my sister for a
          few days.  I'd like you to get your
          stuff out.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          What about Tommy?

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          He'll live through it.  They all
          live through it.
                  (bitter)
          What a world, huh?

Nothing left to say; after a long, last look, she turns to
go.  But stops.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Was it Venza?  Did you get him?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          No.

The last thing she's going to do is cry.

</b>                  (her voice giving
                   out)
          What a shame.

She TURNS and LEAVES:  MIKE gazing after her.

<b>                         ELLIE

A LONG BEAT as TOMMY thinks about this.  His attention
switches to a passing McDONALD'S.

<b>                         TOMMY
</b>          Hey, can we go to McDonald's?

<b>INT.  MILTON GREGORY - BANQUET HALL - EVENING
</b>
Overhead, chandeliers gleam.  A small orchestra comprised
of STUDENTS of the school plays a variety of tunes.
Mirrors reflect a profusion of flowers, carved gilt and
candlelight.

Gloved service PERSONNEL wait to be of service at the
sides.  The room is quite large yet intimate.  The tables
set perfectly.  GUESTS continue to move toward their
places engaged in animated chatter.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  CLAIRE moving through the crowd,
PLAINCLOTHESMEN flanking her as anonymously as possible
(KOONTZ among them), HER EYES anxious, scanning the crowd.

SHE'S SPOTTED by the PRINCIPAL of the school (GIDDINGS),
who APPROACHES, surprised to see her.

<b>                         GIDDINGS
</b>          Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary
          that you came.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          It was something my father always
          liked me to do.

<b>                         GIDDINGS
</b>                  (apprehensive)
          You're planning to speak?

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          Not if you don't want me to.

<b>                         GIDDINGS
</b>                  (a brief hesitation)
          Well, of course, we'd be...
          honored...

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>                  (understands; gamely)
          Just putting in an appearance then.

SHE GLANCES around, her "ESCORTS" mistaking it for
anxiety, one of them taking her arm and escorting her in.

</b>
<b>INT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER
</b>
SPEECHES droning on -- CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE at a round
dinner table, with OTHERS, who think they're engaging her
in conversation; but her thoughts are elsewhere, her eyes
continually glancing toward the doors -- both hoping and
fearing.

<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER
</b>
The SPEECHES have long since ENDED, PEOPLE DANCING, slow
dances to the live orchestra -- CAMERA PANNING to CLAIRE,
sitting in silent isolation at the now sparsely populated
table, having lost hope, feeling utterly alone.  Her chin
is resting in her hand, her eyes fixed sadly on her wine
glass.  PLAINCLOTHESMEN, situated around her, study her
dispassionately.

CLOSE ON HER FACE:  expressionless.  But it slowly gains
animation, as she realizes the MUSIC has changed, made a
segue to something new.  It's "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME."

SHE LOOKS UP -- to see MIKE; his approach from the
bandstand indicating that the change of music was his
doing.

HER FACE breaks into the most enormous, and grateful,
<b>GRIN.
</b>
CLOSE ON MIKE:  returning the smile as he COMES TOWARD.

<b>                         KOONTZ
</b>                  (as he passes)
          Don't do it, man.  I love ya, but
          you're out of your mind.

Uncaring, MIKE MOVES TO CLAIRE.

ANGLE ON BOTH:  gazing at each other.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>                  (overwhelmed)
          What a memory.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Do you dance?

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          Do you?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Pretty bad.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          Let's do it.

They TAKE to the FLOOR, she MOVING INTO HIS ARMS.  She
puts her head on his shoulder, then draws back to look at
him, studying his face with the hunger of a woman who
knows it might be for the last time.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          They guys treatin' you all right?

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>                  (too emotional to
                   really talk)
          Yeah.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I've been doing a lot of thinking.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>                  (a pause)
          I know.

CLOSE ON HIM:  studying her saddened eyes.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          It wouldn't work.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          I know.

The conversation is deeply caring; the tone opposite to
the words.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I'd miss my life...

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          ... Don't explain.

She rests her head on his shoulders again; they continue
to dance.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          How long you going away for?

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          Long enough.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          "For"...?

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          "To"... Forget about you.

CLOSE ON HER:  awash in the nearness of him.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (choked up)
          Yeah...

He holds her tight -- his eyes EMOTIONAL as they roam the
room --

But HIS EXPRESSION CHANGES as he SPOTS SOMETHING at a far
end of the room.  Near the rear doors.

It's a PLAINCLOTHESMEN, headed purposefully toward KOONTZ,
conferring with him -- both men looking to MIKE, a sense
of bewilderment in their eyes.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  Stopping -- as KOONTZ heads quickly
toward.

<b>                         KOONTZ
</b>          Brook's patching a call through to

          It sounds urgent.

MIKE:  Baffled.

<b>                         KOONTZ
</b>          He says it's your son.

Exchanging a quick LOOK with CLAIRE, MIKE heads for the
DOORS; she pauses, heading after.

breath coming in SHUDDERS as he stares helplessly at her
-- then turns to the PLAINCLOTHESMAN and KOONTZ.

The SOUND of a MUFFLED WHIMPER comes from the kitchen; he
HEADS TOWARD down a narrow HALLWAY.  He falters, ALMOST
STEPPING on a SKATEBOARD.

He's used to the SOUND OF HIS VOICE to mask the slight
"roll" of the SKATEBOARD under his foot:  He's sliding it
into the middle of the doorway.

<b>                         MIKE

No answer -- MIKE continues on, girding himself as he
steps into the KITCHEN DOORWAY.  He tries the light-
switch; it doesn't work.  And then a VOICE SPEAKS.  Its
breath, like his, is labored; the VOICE CRACKLING with
tension.

<b>                         VENZA

CLAIRE, having shouted from behind a COP CAR:  KOONTZ
grabbing hold of her to keep her in place.

<b>                         KOONTZ
</b>                  (a hiss of warning)
          Not another word until I tell you.

</b>
VENZA; wary.

<b>                         VENZA
</b>          How do I know that's her?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I'll bring her in.  You let them go,
          and I'll bring her in.

<b>                         VENZA
</b>                  (wary)
          Why should she come in?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          She trusts me.  She'll do what I
          say.

<b>                         VENZA
</b>          Bullshit!  Prove it.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (calls out the
                   window)
          Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire!
          It's pitch dark in here!
                  (his words are
                   carefully chosen)
          You're gonna have trouble seeing
          anything, so just come in, and
          straight down a long hall.  Then
          stand at the door so we can see you.
          We want to see your face and we
          won't be able to until you get to
          the kitchen door!

</b>
<b>EXT.  THE HOUSE - SAME MOMENT
</b>
KOONTZ receiving his "message".  Quickly assessing CLAIRE,
he looks to the COPS around him -- then GRITS HIS TEETH
with DECISION.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  THE KITCHEN - SAME - NIGHT
</b>
<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I want your guarantee they'll be
          turned loose when she opens the
          front door.

<b>                         VENZA
</b>          I get my hostage first.  No one's
          turned loose until I say so.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Let my kid go.

<b>                         VENZA
</b>          I'm not lettin' no one go.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Get that gun away from his head, or
          I'll keep her from coming in!  Put
          the gun on me, he can't hurt you!
          He's tied up!  Put him under the
          table!

<b>                         VENZA
</b>          Don't you fuckin' give orders to
          me...

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Put him under the table or I'll stop
          her from coming in.

MIKE turns to the window, about to shout.

<b>                         VENZA
</b>                  (to Tommy, an order)
          Under the table.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I'll take his place, all right?  Put
          the gun to my head.

MIKE YANKS TOMMY under the TABLE, taking HIS PLACE in THE
CHAIR; the COCKED GUN presses up against MIKE'S TEMPLE.

ANGLE ON ELLIE:  Her widened eyes continuing to INDICATE
"beneath the table".

CLOSE ON TOMMY, ON HIS KNEES, his hands tied behind his
back; emitting a whimper of terror.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          Be careful, Tommy.

HE LOOKS UP:  SPOTTING HER GUN, where she'd hidden it for
safe-keeping, TAPED SECURELY, just OVER HIS HEAD.

The FRONT DOOR OPENS -- with a SLOW CREAK -- the FIGURE OF
CLAIRE, her dress silhouetted by the moonlight from
outside, SEEN standing in the front hallway.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (frantic)
          Claire!  It's dark.  Watch your
          step.  Come slowly.

ANGLE ON TOMMY:  trying desperately to get his hands, tied
behind his back, within reach of the GUN taped over his
head.  It's impossible.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  eyes darting to ELLIE -- as the FIGURE
slowly APPROACHES down the DARKENED HALL, his HAND
lowering beneath his knees, within reach of TOMMY, under
the TABLE.

ANGLE ON TOMMY:  in a near HEADSTAND, his small hands
managing to TOUCH THE TAPE, his fingernails futilely
attempting to DIG BENEATH IT -- as the FOOTSTEPS continue
to APPROACH down the DARKENED HALL.

ANGLE ON THE FIGURE:  almost at the kitchen door -- about
to STEP INTO THE LIGHT.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Watch your step!

<b>                         VENZA
</b>                  (rising)
          What the fuck you doin'?!

TOMMY'S HANDS are on the GUN.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          There's a skateboard in the door!

With a sudden SOUND of TAPE "RIPPING" from under the
<b>TABLE.  ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  TOMMY ROLLS, THRUSTING THE
</b>GUN INTO MIKE'S HAND as the FIGURE at the DOOR KICKS THE
SKATEBOARD, sending it ZOOMING INTO THE ROOM.  VENZA LEAPS
ASIDE AND FIRES, the FIGURE at the DOOR OPENING FIRE in
RETURN.  MIKE LEAPS FOR ELLIE, knocking her off her CHAIR,
rolling FAST as the ENTIRE KITCHEN ERUPTS IN GUNFIRE.

ANGLE ON ELLIE:  throwing herself OVER TOMMY, BULLETS
"PINGING" AROUND MIKE as he ROLLS, RETURNING THE FIRE.
The pitch-black kitchen shudders with BANGS and FLASHES
like the Fourth of July, mixed with the "WHINE" of bullets
hitting pots and pans, and the sight of BODIES hurtling
through the dark.

The "FIGURE AT THE DOOR" is firing with both hands,
SCORING A HIT ON VENZA'S ACCOMPLICE, who goes down,
wounded, HIS GUN CLATTERING to the FLOOR.  He REACHES for
it, but ELLIE GETS THERE FIRST, grabbing it with her two
hands tied in front of her.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>                  (to Tommy)
          Stay down!

The ACCOMPLICE is staggering upward as ELLIE gets to her
feet, SQUARING OFF in POLICE STANCE -- and FIRES, catching
him square between the SHOULDER BLADES; HE SPINS, crashing
BACKWARDS through the GLASS DOOR -- SWISH-PAN to VENZA,
trying to get out THE KITCHEN WINDOW...

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Turn around, fuck!

He DOES, BLASTED by MIKE, and the "FIGURE" in the door,
SIMULTANEOUSLY.  He falls out the window, but still has
life in him, staggering to his feet, and hit by SPOTLIGHTS
from the CARS OUTSIDE.  In a sudden barrage, he's hit by
CROSSFIRE, SPINNING, LURCHING -- finally going down.

And then all is quiet.

INSIDE THE KITCHEN -- all sound and movement has suddenly
ceased; everyone is a state of shock.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>                  (desperate)
          Tommy...!

<b>                         TOMMY
</b>          I'm all right.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Ellie...

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>          I'm all right.

The overhead LIGHT is SNAPPED ON by the "FIGURE" in the
doorway -- revealing it to be KOONTZ.  In CLAIRE'S DRESS.
Guns in both hands, still smoking.

<b>                         KOONTZ
</b>                  (emphatic)
          Fuckin' miracle, man.

In the BACKGROUND distant SIRENS are HEARD heading toward.
The SWAT squad.  CAMERA MOVING ACROSS THE FACES OF ELLIE,
TOMMY, MIKE... and KOONTZ; all holding in place.
Listening to them come.

<b>                         KOONTZ
</b>                  (re: the sirens)
          Told you they'd be here in a few
          minutes.

The grim humor of it is registered in SILENCE.  MIKE picks
up VENZA'S HUNTING KNIFE from the floor, cutting through
the ropes that bind TOMMY'S and ELLIE'S HANDS; she PULLS
TOMMY to HER, in a tearful EMBRACE, shielding his face
from the ghastly sight of the man, lying dead, on the
floor.

OTHER PEOPLE are MOVING INWARD, CLAIRE among them, clad in
an OVERSIZED POLICE OVERCOAT -- looking frail and
frightened, SHUDDERING WITH RELIEF when she sees that all
are safe.  But there is no mistaking the presence of
something else in her eyes.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE'S FACE:  gazing at MIKE, his family
wrapped in his protective embrace.  He LOOKS UP, meeting
her eyes.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          Everyone's all right...?

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Yeah.  It's all over.

LONG ANGLE on the ROOM:  dimly illuminated by the single
light, shed from the opened refrigerator door, as people
begin to move -- awakening to life, and its necessary
details, in the aftermath of the crisis.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  THE HOUSE - SAME
</b>
The LAWN virtually FILLED with POLICE VEHICLES, their
revolving red lights illuminating the grim scene; a small
gathering of onlookers gawking from behind police ropes,
AMBULANCES pulling SLOWLY, SILENTLY, away.

CAMERA PANS to two figures ALONE, beside a squad car, in
the distant shadows.  It's CLAIRE, still clad in the
police overcoat, and MIKE.  They are together, but
separate, maintaining the proper distance to say goodbye.

CLOSER ANGLE ON THEM:  not knowing quite what to say.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          So.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          So.

ANGLE ON BOTH:  their eyes locked into each other's.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          You still going away?

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          I don't know...

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          You don't have to, now.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          I think it's probably still a good
          idea.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  getting her message.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Yeah...

Both are hurting.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>                  (heartfelt)
          I'll miss you, Mike.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Listen, I'll... see you again.

Her eyes are glistening; she gives him a bracing smile.
But he can't quiet manage it.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>                  (barely able to
                   speak)
          Say goodbye.

He struggles with it; unable.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I like your coat.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>                  (half-laugh, half-cry)
          You have a weakness for Lady Cops.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          I do.

Silence now; their eyes adoring.

<b>                         CLAIRE
</b>          Say goodbye, Mike.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (thick voiced)
          You take care.

MIKE TURNS -- CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM as he WALKS SLOWLY
AWAY -- finding himself on a collision course with GARBER.
They meet, spending a long moment in non-communicative
greeting.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>                  (finally)
          What do you think?
                  (a beat)
          Any chance?  There's nothin' else
          I'm any good at, but this.

<b>                         GARBER
</b>                  (noncommittal)
          Call me next week.  We'll talk about
          it.

MIKE absorbs it, looking up to SEE ELLIE and TOMMY, beside
a SQUAD CAR, a distance away.  Girding himself, he HEADS
<b>TOWARD.
</b>
ANGLE ON ELLIE AND TOMMY -- as he APPROACHES, and stands
beside them.  Not much to say.  Finally he reaches out and
tousles TOMMY'S hair.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Good police work, kiddo.

He catches ELLIE'S eye, both assessing each other.

<b>                         ELLIE
</b>                  (re: Tommy)
          He doesn't want to sleep here.
                  (a long beat)
          Neither do I.  It's not my house
          anymore.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Me neither.

ANGLE ON ALL:  finding each other's eyes.

<b>                         MIKE
</b>          Let's find some place to start over.

MIKE puts an arm AROUND TOMMY -- and the CAMERA BEGINS A
LONG PULLBACK, as ELLIE moves to his side, and the KEEGAN
FAMILY begins to MOVE AWAY.  WE SEE CLAIRE, being helped
into a SQUAD CAR, turning to look back at them as it PULLS
AWAY -- CARS REVVING UP and PULLING OUT, in ALL
<b>DIRECTIONS.
</b>
From a distance, we HEAR MIKE'S VOICE.

<b>                         MIKE (V.O.)
</b>                  (to Ellie)
          What this crap about singing
          lessons?

<b>                                            FADE OUT.
</b>
<b>                         THE END
</b>
