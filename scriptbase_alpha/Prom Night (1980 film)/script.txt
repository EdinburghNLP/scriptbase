                         FADE IN:

          EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

          SUPER: April 27, 1973
          All is quiet outside this suburban school on a sunny
          Friday afternoon. Cars idle in the driveway awaiting
          the three o'clock onslaught of liberated children.
          Two faded yellow buses stand ready.

          The lull is shattered by the CLANGING of the final BELL.
          A swarm of children pours out the door and down the
          broad front steps, scattering across the lawn toward
          the cars and the buses.

          Moving slowly through the crowd, ROBIN and ALEX HAMMOND,
          nine-year-old identical twins, appear at the doorway..
          Attractive, dark-haired children, they seem more sub-
          dued than the others. As they walk quietly down the
          stairs, Robin lags behind, staring at a boy teasing a
          girl nearby. He is NICK MCBRIDE, eleven years old,
          two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in
          school. The pretty girl laughing at his antics is KIM
          HAMMOND, also eleven, Robin's older sister.

                         ALEX
          C'mon, Robin.

                         ROBIN

                         (STUTTERING BADLY)
          W-w-where's D-d-daddy?

                         ALEX
          He's got a meeting at the high
          school. We're supposed to walk
          home with Kim...
          (sees Robin watching
          the young couple)
          She's too busy. Let's go
          by ourselves.

                         ROBIN
          N-n-n-no, Alex. Let's w-w-wait.

                         ALEX
          Why?
          Robin is staring at Nick. Alex looks, understands.
          He's angry.

                         ALEX

                         (CONTINUING)
          You're crazy, I'm not waiting.

                         CONTINUED :
          He strides away. Robin's eyes remain on Nick and Kim.
          Nick says something to Kurt. She shakes her head and
          pains toward Robin. Robin quickly turns away as they
          look at her.. When she glances back, Ki_m is walking
          towards her and Nick is bicycling away.

                         KIM
          Okay, let's go.
          The sisters start to walk across the lawn.

                         ROBIN
          Y-you 1-1-like him?

                         KIM
          Who?

                         ROBIN

                         (SMILES SHYLY)
          Y-you know.

                         KIM
          Nick? Oh, he's all right, I guess.
          They walk on in silence with Robin stealing glances at
          her big sister.

                         ROBIN

                         (FINALLY)
          Are y-y-you g-gonna m-in-marry him?

                         KIM
          Robin?
          Robin smiles and takes Kim's hand. They walk along the
          road, kicking rocks and swinging their bookbags. Sud-
          denly Kim halts.

                         KIM

                         (CONTINUING)
          Oh, damn!
          Robin looks up in surprise.

                         KIM

                         (CONTINUING)
          Debbie was gonna lend me her new
          record. Look, you go on home
          by yourself. Tell Mom I'll be
          a little late.
          Before Robin can reply, Kim is hurrying away.

          Robin watches her go, then moves off alone, breaking
          into a skip and playing imaginary hopscotch.
          As she turns off the main road into a side street,
          Robin passes a construction site. The empty skeleton
          of a half-finished apartment building looms up above
          the dark shade trees. Hearing VOICES, Robin stops to
          investigate.

                         ROBIN

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Alex?
          The VOICES continue. Robin moves closer, peering
          through the tall bushes surrounding the lot. She
          sees Nick playing in.the framework with three of his
          classmates. Robin recognizes JUDE CUNNINGHAM, and
          KELLY LYNCH as Kim's two best friends. The fourth
          child, WENDY RICHARDS, is a dark-haired girl, domin-
          eering and loud. As Robin watches, Wendy jumps
          up onto the floor of the building.

                         WENDY
          I want to play 'Murder.' Who's
          the killer?

                         NICK
          You, Wendy!

                         JUDE

                         (GIGGLING)
          you, Nick.

                         KELLY
          Yes, Nick!

                         WENDY

                         (LAUGHING)
          You'll never catch me. Hide your
          eyes, killer!
          As Nick turns his back, hiding his eyes against an ex-
          posed beam, the children scatter through the structure.
          Robin watches with mounting excitement as Nick finishes
          counting, and whirls around.

                         NICK
          The killer is coming for you!
          He moves into the building, chanting "Kill, kill.," in a
          low monotone. As he disappears from view, Robin cau-
          tiously edges out of the bushes and moves up to the
          building.

          NICK (O.S.
          The killer strikes!

                          (CONTINUED)

          Robin hears Jude's SQUEAL of LAUGHTER. Nick has caught
          her. Immediately Jude's VOICE TAKES UP the "kill"
          chant in unison with Nick.

          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY 2

          Robin climbs up onto the floor and peers into the dark,
          gloomy structure. Suddenly, she hears a SHRIEK. Ter-
          rified, she backs against a wall. LAUGHTER FOLLOWS im-
          mediately and Robin hears Kelly's VOICE TAKING UP the
          chant. As the three "killers" move through the vast
          structure searching for Wendy, "KILL, KILT" ECHOES off
          the walls and hardwood floors.
          Robin cautiously steps out of the doorway into the im-
          mense unfinished lobby. Ominous shadows slash across
          the floor as the excited girl listens to the relentless
          CHANTING of the children.
          Robin pushes on a makeshift wooden door. It slips off
          its temporary hinges, crashing down to the floor. The
          NOISE is like a rifle shot; suddenly, there is ABSOLUTE
          SILENCE in the structure.
          Petrified, Robin crouches behind a wall, waiting. The
          CHANTING quickly RESUMES and she breathes a long sigh
          of relief.
          Robin moves through a dark corridor, hugging the walls.
          Flushed with excitement, she imagines herself a "killer"
          searching for Wendy. As she moves past an empty room,
          she hears a SOFT GIGGLE. Robin stops and listens care-
          fully. Once again she hears the GIGGLE, LOUDER this
          time, coming from nearby.
          Stepping to a doorway, she leans around the corner and
          peers inside. In the darkness she can see nothing.
          Gathering her courage, she quietly slips into the room.
          The room appears empty but a closet door is slightly
          ajar. As Robin approaches, she hears a FAINT GASP from
          behind her. Whirling around, she sees Wendy crouched
          behind a cardboard box in the corner.

                         WENDY

                         (HISSING)
          You better not tell!
          Before Robin can react, she hears a THUD from above.
          Looking up, she sees Nick's head appear through an
          opening in the ceiling. Seeing Robin, then Wendy
          standing in the corner, he howls in triumph.

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Here, killers, here!
          Nick's head disappears from the opening and Robin hears
          the POUNDING of RUNNING FEET.

                         WENDY

                         (MALICIOUSLY)
          Now you've done it, you idiot!
          The CHANTING GROWS LOUDER as the "killers" rush towards
          the room. Trapped, Wendy looks frantically for an es-
          cape but finds nothing. Turning around suddenly, she
          grins at Robin, a cruel, hard expression on her face.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING; SLOWLY)
          Kill, kill, kill...
          Picking up the chant, Wendy begins to advance on Robin.
          Terrified, Robin turns and rushes out of the room,
          bowling over Nick in the doorway. Delighted that the
          game is continuing with a new victim, he follows Wendy
          in pursuit of Robin.
          Robin flees down the long, dark corridor, "KILL, KILL
          ECHOING in her wake. As she rounds a corner, Jude ap-
          pears, looming up in front of her. Robin screams and
          sprints in the opposite direction. Kelly leaps out of
          a doorway and grabs for her, but Robin, swinging out
          blindly, escapes the "killer."

          INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY 3

          Darting into the large room, Robin collapses against a
          wall, gasping for breath. As her eyes adjusts to the
          darkness, she spies a rickety ladder extending through
          a hole in the floor to the basement below. Stacked up-
          right near the opening are several sheets of window
          glass. Before Robin can make a move towards the lad-
          der, she hears a horrible SCREECH and Wendy appears in
          the doorway, a vicious look on her face.

                         WENDY
          Killers, here!
          Wendy advances. Terrified, Robin begins to back away.

                         ROBIN
          N-n-n-no!

                         CONTINUED:
          Nick, Jude and Kelly appear in the doorway, chanting
          "Kill, kill." Moving quickly, Robin grabs the ladder
          and starts down into the basement, careful not to knock
          over the sheets of glass stacked near the opening.
          Peering into the pitch-black basement, Robin hesitates.
          But as Wendy and her fellow "killers" close in on her,
          Robin continues down the ladder. Wendy rushes up and
          grabs the ladder.

                         ROBIN

                         (CONTINUING)
          P-p-please!
          Wendy grins and shakes the ladder. The chanting is
          deafening. Robin hugs the wooden slats. Wendy shakes
          even harder. Robin screams. Nick moves around Wendy
          to get a better look. He accidentally bumps the glass
          stacked next to the opening. The sudden movement is
          just enough to dislodge a razor-sharp pane of glass and
          send it hurtling down directly at Robin.
          The girl's last scream catches in her throat as the
          glass slices through her neck. She is instantly
          decapitated.
          Horrified, Wendy watches the glass and the body crash
          to the concrete basement floor. Kelly screams. Jude
          sobs loudly. Nick can only stare in shock. Finally,
          he manages to speak.

                         NICK

                         (WHISPERING HOARSELY)
          We gotta get somebody quick!
          Nick starts to go. Wendy instantly whirls, grabs his
          arm.

                         WENDY
          Are you crazy? They'll put us in
          jail!
          Confused, Nick cannot reply. The other girls grow
          silent.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING)
          If we tell anyone, they'll say
          it's our fault. Who'd believe it
          was an accident?
          Nick starts to protest.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING;

          We'll go home now and never ever
          tell anyone. They'll think it was
          an accident. 1,10 one but us will
          ever know.
          She looks at each of them. They are still too numb to
          respond.

          Kelly looks from Wendy to the mangled body and begins
          to whimper.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING; STERNLY)

          The frightened girl looks up at Wendy.

          I swear.
          Wendy turns to Nick. At first he appears defiant, ready
          to object, but he wilts under her withering gaze.

                         NICK

          With a final glance down at Robin's mutiliated body,
          Wendy quickly ushers her shocked friends out of the
          room.
          As their FOOTSTEPS ECHO away across the hardwood floor,
          there is a terrible silence. Then, starting very
          quietly, more FOOTSTEPS are HEARD, this time a single
          person approaching the ladder from above. The FOOT-
          STEPS STOP and a deep, black shadow falls across the
          ladder; HEAVY BREATHING punctuates the oppressive
          quiet, growing louder and more anguished.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. STORAGE ROOM - DUSK

          We slowly TILT UP TO the tortured features of RAYMOND
          HAMMOND, Robin's father. A handsome, dark-haired man
          in his late thirties, he teaches history at George
          Winston High School.
          Wracked with grief, he stands near the opening in the
          floor and watches as two Paramedics bring up the body
          of his daughter from the dark basement.
          A young Policeman standing nearby raises the white
          sheet covering Robin's remains. Hammond steps up
          and gazes at his daughter's decapitated body. A
          look of absolute horror and revulsion freezes
          on his face; what he sees he will never forget.
          Paralyzed, Hammond barely hears the CAR PULLING UP
          in front of the construction site. He turns and
          looks out the window.

          EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DUSK 5

          A Police Officer is getting out of his car. Walking
          around to the passenger side, he opens the door
          for an attractive blonde woman in her mid-thirties.
          VIVIAN HANMOND, Robin's mother, appears pale and
          haggard as she steps out of the car. Kim and Alex
          slowly climb out of the back, With the Police Officer
          escorting her, Vivian and her children move toward
          the skeleton of a building.
          Catching sight of her husband framed in a lower window,
          Vivian suddenly breaks. away from the Police Officer and
          runs inside the building.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. STORAGE ROOM - DUSK

          Hammond moves quickly to the door, grabbing his
          hysterical wife as she bursts into the room.

                         HA:MMIOND
          No!

                         VIVIAN

                         (SOBBING WILDLY)
          Where is she? Where is Robin?
          Seeing the covered figure lying on a stretcher, Vivian
          moans in anguish.
          Struggling furiously, she strains to break her hus-
          band's hold, but he is too powerful.. They are both
          in tears, shaking with grief, when Kim and Alex step
          into the doorway.

                         KIM

                         WHISPERING)
          Daddy?

                         HAMMOND
          (angrily,

                         TO VIVIAN)
          Why did you bring them here?
          Vivian collapses, burying her head in his shoulder
          and sobbing furiously, but Hammond pushes her out of
          the room.

                         (CONTINUING)
          Kim! Alex! Stay out in the
          hallway!
          Kim stumbles out into the corridor and begins to
          cry softly. Alex takes his mother's hand and tries
          comfort her.
          The Paramedics pick up the stretcher and maneuver it
          out of the room. As they pass through the doorway into
          the corridor, a corner of the sheet slips off Robin's
          corpse. Before a Paramedic can replace it, the de-
          capitated torso is briefly glimpsed by the family.
          Alex is shocked. Kim doesn't appear to realize what
          she sees. But Vivian's horror wells up in her
          throat, bursting out in a deranged scream.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Another SCREAM, as throbbing DISCO MUSIC pulsates from
          a large portable RADIO sitting on a dresser.

          SUPER: APRIL 27, 1980.
          A young woman with long, golden brown hair and a trim
          figure is slipping into a pair of tight jeans. Pull-
          ing on a halter top, she sways to the MUSIC.

          Kim! Turn that music down. You're
          driving me crazy!
          Turning around at the SOUND of her mother's VOICE, Kim
          Hammond reaches for the volume control Now eighteen,
          she is a strikingly beautiful girl with an open,
          innocent quality.

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Okay, Mom!
          Kim quickly finishes dressing, whirling around the room
          to the pounding disco rhythm. Giving her hair a few
          final strokes with a brush, she gazes at a photograph
          of a young man stuck in her mirror. On the picture
          is written: "To Kim, the best on the floor... dancing,
          that is! Love, Nick."
          Kim glances at another photograph stuck in her mirror.
          This one shows her sister, Robin, taken a few days be-
          fore the accident. Her sadness passes as quickly as it
          came. Gathering her textbooks, she switches OFF the
          RADIO and exits.

          8 INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Raymond and Vivian Hammond are just finishing break-
          fast. The years have favored him; except for a touch
          of gray around the temples and a few extra pounds, he
          looks much the same way as we remember him. Vivian,
          however, wears the strain of the past seven years
          in her gaunt, drawn features and high-strung manner.
          Thumbing through his morning newspaper, Hammond steals
          quick glances at his wife. She does not look up at
          him, but stares at the table, toying with her spoon.

          I'll tell you, Vi, I'm thinking
          of starting up an armed robbery
          course at the high school..
          I've got a feeling it'd be
          popular...
          He smiles at his joke, looks at her. She doesn't seem
          to have heard him.

          Kim bursts into the kitchen, interrupting her father
          with a kiss on the head.

                         KIM

          thin.
          Kim and her father exchange glances. He shrugs

          Vivian stumbles to her feet and rushes out of the kitch-
          en before he can finish. With a glance at Kim, Hammond
          hurries after his wife. Going out through the swinging
          door, he bumps into a young man just entering.

          Hammond exits. Alex, now sixteen, a tall, slender
          boy, casts a knowing look at Kim. Kim nods. Alex.
          shakes his head, then begins to rummage through the
          Pantry, pulling out a Hostess viTikie. ?lopping
          down at the table, he flips open his electronics book
          and begins to read. Munching on his Twinkie, he
          swipes sips from Kim's glass of milk.

                         KIM
          Have you got a date for tonight?

          9 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Hammond and Vivian are standing by the fireplace. His
          hand is on her shoulder. She faces the mantel, her
          back to him. On the mantel is a small shrine to the
          memory oftheir dead daughter; a framed photograph,
          fresh roses, two candles and a lock of her hair in a
          glass case.

                         HAMMOND
          Trust me.
          Vivian does not move. Finally, after a long pause,
          she turns toward her husband. Her eyes filled with
          tears, she nods.

          10 INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY 10

          Hammond is driving. Vivian stares blankly out the win-
          dow at the grimy city streets. Sitting in the back,
          Kim and Alex exchange uncertain glances. A tense si-
          lence pervades.

          11 EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 11

          The Hammonds' car pulls up in front of a towering
          modern building.

          Hammond cuts off the engine and turns to Kim and Alex.

          I'll just be a minute...
          Vivian is already reaching for the door handle,

          13 EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 13

          Alex jumps out of the car and opens the door for his
          mother. Taking her arm, he helps her out. Kim leans
          over in the back seat.

                         KIM
          See you later,'Mom.
          Vivian gives her a thin smile. Hammond takes her arm
          and leads her into the imposing building.

          Hammond and Vivian cross the room. Though she offers
          no resistance, it appears he is pulling her along.
          They hurry into an elevator after an elderly CLEANING
          WOMAN carrying a mop and a bucket.

          15 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 15

          They stand in silence. The Cleaning Woman puffs on a
          cigarette, blithely ignoring the NO SMOKING sign posted
          on the wall. Vivian nervously reaches into her purse
          and removes a bottle of Valium. Quickly popping two
          pills into her mouth, she swallows with difficulty and
          snaps her purse shut. Hammond says nothing.
          Just as the elevator doors slide open, the Cleaning Wo-
          man touches Vivian on the shoulder, causing her to jump
          in fright.

                         CLEANING WOMAN
          Could I have one of those? My
          nerves are shot this morning.
          With a terrified glance back at the woman, Vivian
          rushes out of the elevator. Hammond follows.

          16 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 16

          Hammond and Vivian move down the long, empty hallway.
          As they round a corner, a figure is visible unlocking
          a door.

          He's a. portly man in his fifties, trying to disguise
          his girth with careful tailoring.

          17 INT. OFFICE - DAY 17

          Fairchild bustles about the reception area, turning on
          lights, checking his messages and appointment calendar.
          Fairchild is obsessively neat, the office reflects him.

                         HAIIOND
          We appreciate your seeing... us.
          I know how busy you must be.
          Vivian is staring at a painting of a young girl playing
          with a kitten. Catching Fairchild's eye, Hammond nods
          toward the outer door. Vivian does not notice the
          gesture.

          Don't forget we're going to the
          cemetery this afternoon. I want
          Robin to have her flowers.
          Hammond moves over to his wife. Taking her by the
          shoulders, he kisses her lightly on the forehead.

                         HAMMOND
          I won't forget.
          Vivian looks from Hammond to Fairchild, who smiles.
          She enters the office, leaving the door open. Hammond
          shakes hands with Fairchild, and for Vivian's benefit
          adds...
          HAï¿½I`i IOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          Thank you, Doctor.
          Hammond exits.

          18 , INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 18

          Hammond leans against the wall outside Fairchild's of-
          fice. He glances at his watch. The door opens and
          Fairchild steps out, holding a container. Hammond
          walks with him down the corridor towards the water
          fountain.

          H.ANMOND
          She's at it again.

                         FAIRCHILD

                         (NODS)
          Today's the date?

                         HAIM BOND
          Seven years ago today Robin was
          killed.
          Fairchild looks up from filling his container with
          water.

                         (CONTINUING; MUSING)
          This would have been her first prom.

                         FAIRCHILD
          Pardon?

                         HAKMOND
          Tonight's the Junior-Senior Prom
          at our high school. Robin would
          have been sixteen, She and Alex.

                         FAIRCHILD
          The twins... How is Alex?

                         HAIIOND
          Fine. I just thank God he was too
          young to really understand what
          happened to his sister.

                         FAIRCHILD
          And your older daughter?

                         HANMOND

                         (SMILES)
          Kimmy's my princess. Sometimes she'll
          get depressed for a while... but it
          never lasts long. Young people seem
          so much more... resilient.
          They walk back to the office.

                         FAIRCHILD
          (looking up at Hammond)
          And yourself? No scars?

                         HATIOND
          (after a pause)
          I've learned to live them..
          Vivian seems worse this time.

                         FAIRCHILD

                         (NODS)
          The persistence of Vivian's trauma.
          I wonder if there isn't something
          more serious at work here?

                         HAMOND
          Something more serious than her
          daughter's death?

          19 INT. OFFICE - DAY 19

          Vivian fidgets in her chair. She seems very small and
          vulnerable in the large, somber office.

          20 INT. CAR (MOVING) DAY 20

          Alex is seated opposite his father in the front seat.
          Kim is in back. Easy listening MUSIC PLAYS softly on
          the car RADIO. Alex fiddles with the tuning dial,
          searching for music more to his tastes. Lost in
          thought, Hammond does not see the young girl skipping
          through the pedestrian crossing.

                         KIM

                         (SCREAMS)
          Daddy!
          Hammond slams on the brakes, throwing Alex against
          the dashboard.

          21 EXT. STREET - DAY 21

          The CAR SCREECHES to a halt inches away from the terri-
          fied child who stands frozen in the middle of the
          crossing. After a moment, realizing she is safe, the
          girl giggles nervously and skips away.

          22 INT. CAR - DAY 22

          Hammond lets out a sigh and turns to his children.

                         HAMMOND
          You all right?
          They both nod. Alex massages his wrist. Hammond
          slips the car into gear and cautiously continues
          driving.

                         KIM
          You're worried about Mom?

                         HALMOND
          I was...
          He is interrupted by DISCO MUSIC ON the RADIO. Play-
          ing with the tuning dial, Alex quickly tries to pass
          over the music.

                         KIM
          Hey, keep that!
          Alex groans but does as she asks.

                         ALEX
          Disco sucks!

                         HAMZMOND

                          KIM)
          Disco bites it!

                         HAMMOND

                         (DRYLY)
          That's much better.
          The car pulls into the Winston High School parking lot.
          They pile out.

          23 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 23

           Hammond, Kim and Alex walk through the empty lot
           towards the school. Suddenly, we HEAR a loud GRATING
          SOUND coming from nearby. The sudden noise startles
          Kim and she huddles against her father.
          A seedy little middle-aged man with a stubble of gray
          beard appears from behind a row of bushes, brandishing
          a pair of electric hedge clippers.

                         HANMMMOND
          Good morning, Mr. Sykes.
          SANFORD SYKES, the newly-hired custodian, bares his
          yellow teeth in a crooked grin and waves the whirring
          blades in salute. Kim shudders and stays close to
          her father as they walk on.

                         KIM
          He's creepy.

                         ALEX
          I heard he's wacko.

                         HAIIOND
          The man is not... wacko.

                         KIM
          Kelly says he's a pervert, spying
          on the girls undressing in the
          locker room.

                         HAIIOND
          Sykes may have some problems, but
          he's no Peeping Tom. He's been
          thoroughly checked out.

          They climb the broad front steps of the high school.
          Hammond glances at his watch.

                         HAMNIOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          You're early today. Plenty of
          time to study with no one to
          bother you.
          Kim reaches up.and kisses her father on the cheek.
          Pulling out a fashion magazine, she rushes off, call-
          ing back over her shoulder.

                         KIM
          I'.ve got to decide on my hair
          style for tonight.

                         HAMMOND

                         (WRYLY)
          Wonderful. Alex?

                         ALEX
          I'm building an atomic bomb in
          shop.
          Smiling, he moves inside. Hammond shakes his head
          and hurries off.

          24 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 24

          Hammond moves through the empty hallway, stopping at
          a door which reads: PRINCIPAL: RAYMOND HAMMOND. He
          is fumbling for his key when he sees through the
          frosted glass a figure moving around in his office.
          Reaching for the doorknob, he very quietly opens the
          door.

          25 INT. OFFICE DAY 25

          As the door slowly swings open, Hammond sees the outer
          office covered with pieces of paper; sheets are
          scattered across desks and chairs and over most of
          the floor. Stepping inside, Hammond spies a WOMAN
          bending over, frantically picking up paper from the
          floor.
          He slams the door. At the sudden SOUND, the startled
          Woman whirls around, still squatting, and falls on her
          rear.

                         HAMMIOND
          Who are you?

          Flustered, the attractive young Woman hastily gets to
          her feet and straightens her skirt.

                         WOMAN

                         (BADLY FLUSTERED)

          Hammond tosses his briefcase onto the desk and drops
          into his chair. He stares at the telephone for a long
          moment, drumming his finger on the desk.

                         CUT TO:

          27 INT. BEDROOM - DAY 27

          A pink TELEPHONE RINGS. The plush bedroom is empty;
          suddenly Wendy Richards rushes in. Now eighteen, Wendy
          is a raven-haired beauty with a full figure, accentua-
          ted by a low-cut black blouse and tight designer jeans.
          Tossing her books onto the bed, she eagerly grabs the
          receiver.

                         WENDY

                         (BREATHLESSLY)
          Nick?
          A long pause, followed by HEAVY BREATHING. Wendy is
          about to respond when the inhuman VOICE speaks in an
          eerie, androgynous stutter.

                         TELEPHONE VOICE
          W-Wendy? T-t-tonight it's m-m-my
          t-turn!
          Wendy's shock quickly turns to anger.

                         WENDY
          Screw you, Lou!
          Wendy slams the receiver into its cradle. Grabbing her
          books, she storms out of her bedroom.

          28 INT. FRONT HALL - DAY 28

          Wendy hurries do-in the ornate staircase.
          Waiting at the bottom holding the girl's sweater is
          MAUDE, the Richards' elderly housekeeper.

                         MAUDE
          You be home for dinner, Wendy?
          Wendy angrily grabs her sweater from the woman.

                         WENDY
          How the hell do I know?
          She exits.

          29 EXT. RICHARD'S HOUSE - DAY 29

          The expansive residence sits back off the road in this
          upper-middle-class suburb. Wendy climbs into her
          white Mustang and starts the engine. TIRES SQUEALING,
          she ROARS out of the driveway with the RADIO BLASTING.

          30 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 30

          Kelly Lynch is just finishing breakfast when the
          TELEPHONE RINGS. The petite blonde eighteen-year-old
          stuffs a last bite of toast into her mouth and picks
          up the receiver.

                         KELLY

                         (MUMBLING )
          Hullo?
          A pause, then HEAVY BREATHING. Kelly's eyes grow wide
          as the dreadful voice speaks.

                         TELEPHONE VOICE
          K-K-Kelly? T-tonight it's m-m-ï¿½IZ
          Horrified, Kelly drops the phone. The DOORBELL RINGS.
          Frightened, she gasps, hugging the wall. The DOORBELL
          RINGS again. Very slowly she moves out of the kitchen.

          31 INT. HALL - DAY 31

          Kelly cautiously approaches the front door. Peering
          through a crack in the drapes, she sees a dark figure
          huddled near the door. With the latch secured, she
          takes a deep breath and opens the door.

                         KELLY
          Yes?

          DREW (O.S.)
          Christ, Kelly, c'mon! We're late!
          Relief floods across her face. Kelly quickly unfastens
          the latch.

                         KELLY
          Oh, Drew, thank God!
          She throws herself into the arms of the pleasantly sur-
          prised DREW SHINNICK, a muscular blond athlete.

                         DREW
          (holding her tightly)
          I'm glad to see you, too.

          Nightmare?

                         (INTERRUPTS)
          Turned you on did he? Maybe I
          should try that!
          She breaks from his grasp.

                         KELLY
          'm serious!
          Drew makes a grab for her but she avoids him, hurries
          inside. He sighs and leans against the doorjamb to
          wait.

                         DREW
          So am I.,.

          32 INT. CAR (MOVING) - DAY 32

          Drew is driving, his-arm around Kelly. She still
          appears shaken by the telephone call. The RADIO is ON.
          His right hand slowly descends towards her breast.
          She swats it away. The hand moves to her back, slid-
          ing down. She leans back, pinning his arm against the
          seat.
          The car stops at a light and Drew is instantly on Kelly,
          biting her neck and kissing her hard on the mouth. She
          pushes him back.

                         KELLY

                         (ANGRY)
          I thought we were late.

          We'll get there... eventually.

                         KELLY
          Really?
          Drew HONKS the HORN at another driver.

                         DREW
          Hell, you should be glad. A lot
          of girls would love to have
          someone steady like me.
          His irrepressible right hand starts up her leg.

                         KELLY

                         (MOCK-SWEETLY)
          Steady? You mean persistent,
          don't you, darling?
          Grabbing his hand, she holds it firmly in her lap,
          which doesn't bother Drew at all.

          33 INT. HALL - DAY

          Jude Cunningham is leaving her house when the TELE-
          PHONE RINGS. The chubby, brown-haired girl rushes
          back into the hallway.
          A plump, middle-aged woman hurries out of the kitchen,
          wiping her hands on an apron. MRS. CUNNINGHAM
          eagerly watches her daughter snap up the receiver.
          The pause, the HEAVY BREATHING and the strange,
          terrifying voice.

                         TELEPHONE VOICE
          J-Jude? T-t-tonight it's my-my
          t-t-turn!
          A disappointed Jude slowly replaces the receiver. Mrs.
          Cunningham looks on sympathetically.
          Still no date?

                         JUDE
          (shakes her head)
          Getting closer, though.

                         (SMILES)
          An obscene call... and not very
          obscene at that!
          Mrs. Cunningham starts to say something.

                         JUDE

                         (CONTINUING)
          Sorry, Mom, gotta run.
          Giving her mother a quick peck on the cheek, Jude
          exits.

          34 EXT. CUNNINGHAM'S HOUSE - DAY

          The small house appears almost identical to the other
          dwellings in this lower-middle-class neighborhood. Jude
          pulls an apple from her large purse, munching while
          she walks to the bus stop.
          A gaudily-painted van pulls up alongside her. The win-
          dow slowly rolls down and a young curly-haired GUY
          wearing glasses sticks out his head.

                         GUY
          Hey, beautiful, need a lift?
          Jude continues walking, the van moving slowly alongside
          her.

                         JUDE
          No thanks.

                         GUY
          C'mon, I won't bite.
          Jude chomps down hard on her apple.

                         JUDE
          So who are you?
          TheGuy leans further out the window.

                         GUY
          Seymour Stone but..
          He's cut short as the van bounces up onto the sidewalk.
          Jude shrieks. The flustered boy steers the van quickly
          back onto the road.

          Jude laughs, almost choking on her apple.

                         JUDE
          I can see why... How old are you,
          Slick?

                         GUY (SLICK)
          Old enough...

                         JUDE
          I've heard about guys like you...
          running over girls on the sidewalk...

                         SLICK
          Just some girls... If they're good
          lookin' I give 'em a ride.

                         JUDE

                         (SMILING)
          Can you stop that thing?
          Slick jams on the brakes. The van jerks to a halt.
          He opens the passenger door.

                         JUDE

                         (CONTINUING)

          She climbs inside.

          35 INT. VAN (MOVING- DAY 35

          The interior is decked out in plush red carpet with a
          bed in back, a stereo cassette deck, and a small fridge.
          MUSIC is PLAYING. Jude looks around.

                         JUDE
          Looks like a cheap motel.

                         SLICK
          Cheap?... that's a two hundred
          dollar waterbed there...
          Jude turns around for a look.

                         JUDE
          You think this is the time to study?
          She grabs the book, gives it to him. He places it on
          the fold-down table between them, flips it open. The
          inside is hollowed out into a container. It contains
          nearly a hundred neatly rolled joints.

                         SLICK
          Straight to Winston High?

          36 EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT DAY

          The van weaves through the parked cars, passing up
          several vacant spots. It finally SCREECHES to a halt
          at the far end of the lot near some high bluffs over-
          looking a lake.

          37 INT. VAN

          The air is thick with smoke.

          A tall rugged-looking man wearing a police uniform
          stands in ,the center of the room checking over his
          revolver. He's DARRYL McBRIDE, forty-eight years old
          and a veteran Sergeant on the Police Force. Satisfied
          with the condition of the gun, he jams it back into its
          holster, turns, calls out.

          A handsome dark-haired boy of eighteen emerges from a
          back room. He's Nick McBride. His father pulls open
          the front door.

                         MCBRIDE

                         (CONTINUING)

                         NICK
          Right, I know...
          McBride steps out into the hallway. Nick grabs his
          books and follows. The TELEPHONE RINGS. Nick hesi-
          tates. Shaking his head he exits, shutting the door.

          39 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

          The TELEPHONE keeps RINGING. McBride looks at his son.

          Three months ago... you can't tell
          Wendy anything she doesn't want to

          40 INT. SCHOOL SHOP - DAY 40

          Alex is alone in the large room. ROCK MUSIC BOOMS out
          of two huge SPEAKERS suspended from the ceiling. Alex
          sits behind a console, flipping switches and turning
          dials, electronically distorting the music.
          A wall TELEPHONE RINGS.. Caught up in his own manufac-
          tured sounds, Alex ignores it. After several more
          RINGS, he reluctantly leaves the console and answers
          the phone.

                         ALEX
          Hello... what?...
          He listens, expressionless, then hangs up. He flips
          a switch on the console and the MUSIC STOPS. He sits
          there a moment, thinking. Then he turns out the lights
          and exits.

          41 INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY 41

          Kim walks down the long deserted corridor. She hears
          FOOTSTEPS. She turns. No one. Shaking her head, she
          continues walking.
          The FOOTSTEPS return, louder. Kim begins to hurry.
          She rounds a corner and slips against the wall, waiting.
          Silence. With a deep breath, she moves on to her
          locker.
          Kim quickly twists the dial on the combination lock and
          yanks open the door. Grabbing several books she slams
          the door shut.
          A mop HANDLE CRASHES into the locker, missing her head
          by inches. The SHARP REPORT echoes down the corridor.
          Terrified, Kim jumps back, spins around. Sykes is
          standing there.

                         SYKES
          S-s-sorry, Missy. You hurt?
          Her heart pounding wildly, Kim rushes into the gym.
          Sykes picks up his mop.

          Kim runs into the huge deserted gym, glancing frantical-
          ly over her shoulder. Her FOOTSTEPS CLATTER across the
          hardwood floor. She stops, waits to recover her breath.
          The room glows tgith a crystalline light sparkling off
          the silver decorations put up for the Prom. Stretched
          across the bleachers is a banner reading: "DISCO

          MADNESS."
          Gazing around, Kim feels the excitement of anticipation.
          Imagining herself in Nick's arms, she begins to dance,
          whirling through the gym to the music in her head.
          Suddenly, someone is clapping, slowly.

          WENDY (O.S.)
          Bravo...
          Kim stops abruptly. Standing onstage, watching her, is
          Wendy.

          You wish! Nick is King of the
          Prom, you happen to be Queen of
          the Prom... that's all there is to
          it, Hammond... As far as anything
          else... Nick is mine...

                         KIM
          You really ought to tell him that.

                         WENDY
          I'm telling you, okay? Stay away
          from Nick!

                         KIM
          You and Nick haven't been together
          in ages.

          It's not who you go with, honey...
          it's who takes you home.

                         KIM
          I'll try and remember that.

          43 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 43

          The corridor is packed with students -- flirting,
          gossiping, fighting, a few even studying. We PICK UP
          Kim and VICKI CANTRELL, eighteen, moving down the crowd-
          ed hallway through the various conversations.

                         KIM

          Kim. and Vicki excitedly hug Jude. A big, bushy-haired
          youth with a stubble of beard strolls by, smirking when
          he sees the girls embracing. LOU PERANO, a twenty-year-
          old high school junior, stops and stares.

                         LOU
          I knew there was some reason Kim
          wouldn't go out with me. She likes

          Let's go.
          They head down the hallway to their lockers. Lou tags
          along.

                         LOU
          You girls get bored with each
          other, I'm always around, you know?
          They pass Kelly and Drew huddled at her locker. His
          hands rest on her shoulders. They are talking intently.

                         VICKI
          Poor girl must be exhausted. Look
          how he has to hold her up...

                         WITH WENDY)
          Uh oh.
          Kim stops suddenly and turns to look. Lou bumps into
          her, his hand purposely grazing her rear.

                         KIM
          Go play with yourself, Lou.

                         LOU

          up talking to Wendy.

          Kim brushes past Nick without a word. The two girls ex-

          Kim does not turn back. Walking next to her, Vicki
          watches her friend curiously. Kim giggles. A sneaky
          smile creeps across her face.

          Kim punches her friend but the damage is done. Nick
          grins broadly. Blushing, Kim turns back, flashes him a
          quick smile and disappears around a corner to the hoots
          of Vicki and Jude.

          44 INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 44

          A tall dark figure walks quickly down a concrete cor-
          ridor. From somewhere nearby, loud VOICES, SPLASHING
          water, can be HEARD.

          The door edges open. Raymond Hammond appears. Prop-
          ping the door open with his shoulder, he starts down
          across the narrow gallery to the pool below.

          46 INT. POOL 46

          A class of senior male students occupies the water,
          among them Nick McBride and Drew Shinnick. With no
          Phys. Ed. instructor in sight, it's a general goof-off
          period.
          Nick walks out onto the diving board. Drew is treading
          water below him.

          47 ANGLE ON HAMMOND 47

          48 INT. POOL 48

          Nick launches himself out over Drew in an apparent
          belly-flop. At the last moment, he tucks in and hits
          the water in a flipped over cannonball. He surfaces to
          a chorus of whistles and cheers. It was a close shave.

                         DREW
          You wanta take care of yourself,
          man... Kim's expecting a lot from

          Nick laughs.

          The door is easing shut. Hammond is nowhere to be seen.

          50 INT. GYM - DAY 50

          A side door opens. Hammond steps in, gazes around.
          The gym is empty, silent. He walks to the stage steps,
          climbs up, pushes through the thick curtain.

          51 INT. GYM - BACKSTAGE 51

          It's a dark cluttered area broken up by tall partitions,
          discarded flats from old student productions, banks of
          lights.
          Hammond crosses to a rear door, tries it. It's locked.
          He turns back. As he does so there's a sudden WHIRRING
          SOUND. A row of spotlights flashes on right in front
          of him, almost blinding him. He tries to shield his
          eyes.

          He spins around. Another bank of lights flares at
          him. He staggers downstage. The curtains begin to
          swing open. Startled, he jumps away from them. His
          foot lands on a package of photo-flood bulbs.. There's
          a LOUD POP. Then a VOICE.

          ALEX (O.S.)
          Who's there?
          Hammond, shaken, looks across to the far wing. There's
          an elevated platform where the electronic control panel
          is located. Alex peers down.

                         HAMMOND
          Alex?... What the hell're you
          doing?

                         ALEX

          together.

          He turns, climbs down the stage steps and starts back
          across the gym. At the other end of the floor a door
          opens, Sykes looks in. Hammond sees him.

          HA, MOND

                         (CONTINUING)

          Sykes waits as Hammond hurries across to him. The two
          men go out together.

          52 INT. CLASSROOM (LAB) - DAY 52

          First period biology class features MONTY WELLER, a
          tall, thin Englishman in his late thirties. This stuf-
          fy, dour science teacher drones on about the joys of ex-
          ploring frog vertebrae while most of his class naps,
          daydreams or passes notes.
          Seated in the back near the door, Jude is furtively
          opening a handwritten note. She quickly reads it.
          Stifling a giggle, she looks up to see Kim and Vicki
          across the aisle, eagerly awaiting her reply. Jude
          tears out part of a page from her biology book and
          scrawls her answer. Folding the note, she taps the boy
          next to her and motions for him to pass it on.
          Vicki grabs the note from the boy. Quickly scanning
          it, she nods, impressed. Kim reads it and mouths the
          word "Wow" to Jude who blushes happily.
          Glancing out into the hallway, Jude notices Slick walk-
          ing past. Seeing her in class, he stops and waves.
          Jude frantically tries to motion him away. Their backs
          to the door, Kim and Vicki watch with curiosity as Jude
          gestures in their direction. Seeing her friends
          watching her, Jude smiles and tries to ignore Slick.
          Not to be denied, he exaggeratedly mimes Weller, nose
          to his textbook, lecturing on, oblivious to his class.
          Jude laughs in spite of herself. Kim and Vicki turn
          around.
          Glancing out the door, the two girls stare in disbelief
          at the small weird curly-haired boy doing a perfect im-
          itation of the eminently boring Weller. Their surprise
          turns to hilarity as they realize this boy must be
          Jude's prom date. Kim holds up the note, raising her
          eyebrows as she gestures toward Slick. Jude nods. Kim
          and Vicki can barely contain their laughter. They do
          not notice Mr. Weller eyeing them suspiciously as he
          rattles on about frog intestines. Slick mouths the
          words, "See you at lunch.., in the van." Jude nods and
          smiles.
          With a final bow and a wave, he exits.
          Kim suddenly looks up to find a red-faced Mr. Weller
          looming above her.

                         WELLER
          Miss Hammond!
          Wide-eyed, Kim desperately tries to crush the note in
          her hand.

          Kim swallows and steals a quick glance at her friends.
          Vicki winces. Jude tries to disappear beneath her, seat.

          and his name is Slick!
          The classroom erupts into laughter as the BELL RINGS,
          signaling the end of the class. Still laughing, stu-
          dents gather their books and shuffle out, several giv-
          ing Kim sympathetic glances as they pass.

                         WELLER
          After school, Miss Hammond. One
          hour detention study hall... you
          and your friends!
          Kim looks from Jude to Vicki.

          But, Mr. Weller, tonight's the

          He spins on his heel and marches back to his desk. The
          three girls hurriedly exit.

          53 INT. ROOM (SCHOOL) - DAY 53

          A hand is flipping through the pages of the Winston
          High yearbook, the back pages where the individual
          photographs of graduating students are placed. The
          hand stops, moves across an open page to a smiling head
          shot of Nick McBride.
          The hand rips the picture from the page, sets it down
          on a plain wooden desk alongside three other pictures
          -with similar torn edges. The other pictures are of
          Jude Cunningham, Kelly Lynch, and Wendy Richards.
          The yearbook is slammed shut.

          54 INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 54

          Kim, Jude and Vicki enter the crowded room. MUSIC from
          several portable RADIOS can be HEARD above the clamor
          as the girls move into the long lunch line. Kim spots
          Alex seated nearby and waves to him.

          Here comes the incredible hunk
          himself.
          Jude looks up to see Slick slowly making his way down
          the line towards them. He is carrying a tray piled
          high with snack food: potato chips, cookies, candy.
          Jude smiles as he passes her, grinning.

                         KIM
          Looks like a party.

                         JUDE
          Yeah -- I don't think he's gonna
          be too good for my diet...
          Slick moves down the lunch line. Suddenly he is bumped
          from behind, sending the tray and the snacks flying
          across the room. Looking around, Slick jumps back,
          startled by a tall figure wearing a dark ski mask.

                         SLICK

          Three of Lou's gang quickly step up behind the masked
          figure.

          Say what?

          That's what I figured.
          Slick bends over to pick up his lunch.

                         (SOFTLY)

          Lou and his friends shove ahead in the line until he is
          standing behind Kim. Lou nuzzles Kim's neck.

                         LOU

          Startled, Kim spins around. Her fear quickly becomes
          anger.

                         KIM
          It's an improvement!
          She turns her back to him.

                         LOU
          You like it so much...
          (spins her around to

                         FACE HIM)
          Have a taste.
          He kisses her hard on the mouth. Swinging at him, Kim
          breaks away. Laughing, Lou grabs her wrists and rough-
          ly pulls her to him. Alex instantly jumps to his feet.

                         LOU

                         (CONTINUING;
          holding Kim close)
          Be nice...
          Alex leaps over the metal railing separating the line
          from the tables. Crashing into Lou, he drives the
          larger boy back into the salad counter, sending food
          and utensils flying. As they tumble off the counter
          onto the floor, Alex gets in several furious punches
          before Lou's gang can pry him loose.
          Two of the gang pin Alex against the counter. Wiping
          blood from his mouth, Lou grins maliciously and slugs
          Alex in the stomach. The boy groans and doubles over.
          Lou grabs Alex's hair and slams his head back against
          the glass shield of the counter.
          As Lou rears back to throw another punch, his two
          friends suddenly release Alex and scatter. The boy
          crumples to the floor. Lou turns around to see two
          MALE TEACHERS rapidly approaching. The larger teacher
          grabs Lou.

                         TEACHER
          This time you're out, Perano.
          Lou points to Alex who is being helped up from the
          floor.

          Alex nods, leaning on the other teacher for support.

                         KIM
          That's not true! Alex was trying
          to help me.
          The teacher looks from Kim to Lou to Alex.

                         TEACHER
          You'd better come along to your
          father's office.

          Wonder who'll get off with just
          a warning?
          Several students laugh. The two Teachers march Lou and
          Alex through the silent cafeteria. Lou swaggers bask-
          ing in the attention. Alex walks with his head bowed.
          They exit.

          55 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 55

          Lou and Alex accompany the teachers down the corridor
          toward the principal's office. Nick and Wendy approach
          from the opposite direction, talking heatedly.

          Hammond is talking on the telephone. He appears agi-
          tated, running his fingers through his hair and tugging
          at the knot in his loosened tie.

          I told you we'd go to the cemetery...
          The door opens and Adele Cooper's head peers around the
          corner. Seeing Hammond talking on the phone, she nods
          toward the outer office. Hammond gestures for her to
          wait. She persists until he angrily takes the receiver
          from his ear and covers the mouthpiece.

          picture on your desk.
          Hammond automatically glances at the photograph of
          Robin framed alongside one of the rest of his family.

          turns to glare at Lou.

          Lou laughs and walks off toward the parking lot. Kim
          shudders.
          Wendy's white Mustang slides up to the curb. The pass-
          enger window rolls down and Lou leans over to look in-
          side. After a moment he climbs in and the MUSTANG
          PEELS out of the lot, leaving twin black tread marks in
          its wake.

                         KIM
          What a pair!

                         VICKI
          Made for each other!
          Kim opens a carton of yogurt.

                         KIM
          You wearing that green gown tonight?

                         VICKI
          You kidding? That was last year.
          This year... red silk!
          (smiles and runs her
          hand from her neck
          to her waist)
          Cut to here! ...

          NICK (O.S.)
          Cut to where?
          Kim and Vicki turn to see Nick ambling across the lawn
          toward them.

          58 EXT. STREET - DAY

          Wendy's white Mustang streaks through traffic, dodging
          in and out of lanes, running yellows, burning around
          corners.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59 INT. MUSTANG 59

          Lou sits pinned to the passenger seat, eyes wide,
          staring straight ahead as if he can't quite believe
          this trip. His bravado seems to have left him. He
          glances over at Wendy in the driver's seat. She's
          puffing on a cigarette, handling the wheel almost
          casually. She's in control,

          60 EXT. DRIVE-IN 60

          The Mustang suddenly slows down and makes a hard left
          turn, narrowly beating a horn-honking oncoming van.
          The big white car bounces up over the curb and sweeps
          into the end slot at a sprawling fast-food drive-in.

          61 INT. MUSTANG 61

          Lou's still pinned to his seat. Wendy shuts off the
          engine, looks at him. He looks at her, lets out a
          long deep breath.
          A cute little CAR-HOP in a cut-off costume and roller
          skates glides over. She leans into Wendy's window,
          talks through a wad of gum.

                         CAR-HOP
          Ready to order?

                         WENDY

                         (TO LOU)
          What do you want?
          Lou's shifting around in his seat, pulling himself
          together.

                         LOU
          I'm uh... a little short on cash..

                         WENDY
          You can owe me.

                         LOU
          Yeah? Okay then, a couple of
          burgers, a large fries... what
          kind of beer you got?

                         CAR- HOP
          C'mon man, this is a drive-in not
          a bar.

                         LOU
          All right, all right... don't get
          nervous... Gimme a coke...

                         WENDY
          That ' sit.
          The Car-hop shrugs, wheels away. Wendy turns to Lou.

                         WENDY
          I'll buy you one for Christmas,
          all right? Now, how do I know
          you're serious?

                         LOU
          Whatta you mean, serious? I hate
          that school, Hammond and his
          asshole family...

                         WENDY
          I don't want anyone hurt... not
          badly.

                         LOU
          You got it... anything your little
          heart desires...

                         WENDY
          Lou, shouldn't we go over this.
          Lou puts his finger to her mouth, silencing her.

                         LOU
          I'll take care of it, Scout's
          honor... Don't worry about it...

          He caresses her cheek and lips, then kisses her. At
          first reluctant, Wendy quickly takes over. When they
          finally break from their passionate clinch, he is
          gasping.

                         LOU

                         (CONTINUING)
          Jesus Christ!

                         WENDY
          Don't worry about it..
          She unbuttons his shirt and begins to kiss and lick his
          chest. Slowly she works her way down. Lou begins to
          writhe. Wendy's head disappears from VIEW. Lou's eyes
          snap open in surprise.
          Wendy groans.

                         WEND Y
          Damn stick shift!
          Lou starts to protest, then dissolves.

          62,. INT. MUSTANG - DAY 62

          The Car-hop wheels up to the Mustang carrying a tray
          loaded with food. She leans over and peers inside.
          Wendy is behind the wheel, perfectly composed. A mind-
          blown Lou is hurriedly doing up his belt, tucking in
          his shirt. He glances at the Car-hop then turns away
          to finish the job.

                         CAR-HOP
          Enjoy your meal.

          63 EXT. LAKE-SIDE BLUFFS - DAY 63

          A WIDE VIEW; high weather-worn bluffs tumbling down to
          a strip of beach and the calm blue waters of the lake.
          Above the bluffs there's a narrow shaded park and then
          the buildings and parking lots of Winston High.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         63 CONTINUED:
          Nick and Kim walk slowly along the rim of the bluffs.
          Nick has his arm around her. She leans into him.

                         KIM
          I am excited, it's just... in some
          ways it's such an awful day... It's
          Robin's day...

          64 EXT. BLUFFS CLOSER ANGLE 64


                         KIM
          My mother's all upset, as usual.
          My father too... he doesn't show
          it so much... It's hard to get
          over something like that. Robin
          would have been a junior, like
          Alex. This would've been her first
          prom... I guess that's'why it seems
          so much worse this year...
          She stops, turns and faces Nick. It's hard for him to
          meet her gaze.

                         KIM

                         (CONTINUING)
          The Queen of the Prom is determined
          not to let it get to her... She
          must maintain her... whatever, at all
          costs..
          She tries a weak smile. Nick stares at her, then sud-
          denly takes her, pulls her to him, embraces her. She's
          caught by surprise, but she responds.
          She smiles.

                         KIN
          I love you too.

                         NICK
          I'm... I want you to know that...
          Robin's death... I remember it and
          I've always been... so sorry
          about it...
          Kim looks puzzled.

                         NICK

                         (CONTINUING)
          I mean... I know what you're
          feeling... I've...
          (looks at her)
          :Listen I...
          Across the school parking lot a CAR HORN BLARES, inter-
          rupts Nick. Kim reacts.

                         KIM
          That's my father... I've got to go,
          Okay?

                         NICK
          Yeah... I'll see you later.
          She hesitates a moment, then kisses him quickly, turns
          and goes. Nick looks shaken up. He stares after her
          as she hurries away.
          Behind Nick, in the other corner of the parking lot, a
          metal door slides open, loud RAUNCHY ROCK and ROLL sud-
          denly infests the air. Nick turns, sees Jude climbing
          out of Slick's van. Jude looks about as stoned as she
          can get. She spots Nick, waves.

                         JUDE
          Hey, Nick!
          Nick turns and heads the other way.

          65 EXT. CEMETERY - HAMMOND PLOT - DAY 65

          There's a small marble headstone inset with the carved
          face of an angel and the inscription "Robin Anne Hammond
          1964 - 1973 Too Soon Taken From Us."
          Kneeling beside the grave is Vivian Hammond. She's ar-
          ranging a large bouquet of mixed flowers, fussing with
          them, trying for some kind of impossible perfection.

          HP`ï¿½MOND (0. S.

          She doesn't react, she keeps playing with the flowers.
          Hammond moves in behind her, puts his hands on her
          shoulders. She looks at him.

                         HAMMOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          We have to get back.
          She stands, with her husband's support. Kim and Alex
          are standing quietly at the foot of the grave. Vivian
          looks at them both. Her eyes hold a terrible rage, a
          terrible sadness. Hammond carefully guides her away.
          Kim has a flower of her own, a white rose, which she
          drops on her sister's grave. She turns, meets Alex's
          stare, moves off after her parents. Alex remains a mo-
          ment longer, then. he, too, goes.

          66 EXT. TENNIS COURTS DAY

          During the afternoon phys. ed. class, the girls play
          tennis: Kim with Kelly and Vicki with Jude. Sykes
          lingers nearby, watching the girls. Their instructor
          is Miss HENRI-ANNE BENTON, a stocky woman in her late
          thirties with teased, lacquered hair. A product of
          genteel Southern womanhood, Henri-Anne stalks the
          courts in her baggy Bermuda shorts, constantly blowing
          a silver whistle hanging from her neck.
          A very stoned, giggling Jude runs Vicki ragged, hitting
          balls over the fence, straight up in the air and occa-
          sionally even back over her head. Each time a ball
          flies over the fence, Vicki runs to retrieve it to the
          delight of Sykes.
          At one point, Vicki bends over to pick up a ball under
          Sykes' appreciative gaze. The shrill WHISTLE inter-
          rupts her as Henri-Anne rushes over.

                         HENRI-ANNE

                         (SOUTHERN ACCENT)
          No, no, Miss Cantrell! Never bend
          from the waist... Squat!

                         (DEMONSTRATES)
          Always squat to retrieve.
          Otherwise, you look like the broad
          side of a barn!
          (glares at Sykes)
          Isn't that so, Mr. Sykes?
          Embarrassed, the custodian scuttles away to the girls'
          Laughter.

          We don't want you all worn out for
          the ball tonight.

          Anne.

          promptly at three-fifteen for
          rehearsal?

          Kim, wide-eyed, can only look at Vicki.

                         VICKI
          He keeps making Kim stay after
          school in detention study hall for
          no reason... Just so he can be
          near her.

                         HENRI-ANNE
          That's horrible!
          Kim gulps.

          So you have detention this
          afternoon?
          Kim nods meekly. Lost in thought, Henri-Anne fondles a
          tennis ball, a curious smile playing across her face.

                         (INTERRUPTING)
          It worked, didn't it?

          67 EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY 67

          Kim and Vicki, and behind them, Jude and Kelly are
          walking back to the gym and the dressing rooms from the
          tennis courts. Vicki's in high spirits and Jude still
          can't stop giggling.
          Vicki spots old Sykes heading out toward the playing
          field. She calls out to him.

                         VICKI
          Mr. Sykes!

                         KIM
          Vicki, don't...

                         VICKI
          Oh, Mr. Sykes...
          Sykes stops, turns around.

                         VICKI

                         (CONTINUING)
          This is just for you...
          She turns, bends over, quickly yanks down her shorts
          and moons him. There's a squeal of laughter from Jude
          and from Kelly. Vicki whips her shorts back up and
          runs to the gym door, the other girls in pursuit.
          Kim looks back at Sykes. He's just standing in the
          field, not moving. There's a look in his eyes.

          68 INT. GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM - DAY 68

           Kim and Kelly are undressing. Three girls pass them
          headin g for the showers.

                         KELLY
          I'm not like the others, Kim.
          Drew needs somebody like Vicki
          who'll give him what he wants.

                         KIM

                         (LAUGHS)
          Vicki's sex life is more talk than
          action. Besides, Drew wants you.

                         KELLY
          I'm afraid if I don't make it with
          him he'll find somebody who will.

                         KIM

                         (SHRUGS)
          Let him.

                         KELLY
          I'd die if he did...
          The girls wrap towels around themselves and walk to-
          wards the showers.

          69 INTT. SHIER AREA - DAY 69
          A girl (MELANIE) is leaving as Kim and'Kelly enter.
          Wendy is standing in front of a mirror drying her hair.
          Kim ignores her and Wendy returns the compliment.

                         MELANIE
          See you outside, Wendy.

                         WENDY
          Just be a minute...
          Kim and Kelly hang up their towels and step into the
          showers.

                         KELLY
          What about you and Nick?

                         KIM
          What about us?
          Wendy finishes brushing her hair, shoots Kim.a dark
          look, exits.

                         KELLY
          What.happened when he asked you?
          Kim smiles.

                         KIM
          Maybe I asked him...
          Kelly looks at her friend.

          70 INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 70

          Wendy finishes buttoning her blouse. She's pulling on
          her jeans when she hears a SCUFFLING SOUND.

                         WENDY
          I'll be right there, Melanie.
          No answer. Curious, Wendy moves around the lockers,
          investigating. The room appears empty.
          There's a sudden LOUD CREAKING. Wendy whirls around.
          A locker door is swinging slowly open.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING)
          Melanie?...
          Still no answer. Shaking her head, Wendy returns to
          her locker.

                         (CONTINUED)

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         70 CONTINUED: 70
          She's about to shut it when she sees something, a pic-
          ture, taped to the side of the door. It's her photo,
          torn from the School Yearbook. She rips it from the
          door, looks at it.

                         WENDY

                         (CONTINUING)
          What's this for, Melanie?
          Her voice echoes through the empty room. She gazes
          around, fear creeping into her face. She quickly
          finishes dressing, grabs her books, turns to leave.
          Suddenly she screams.

          71 INT. SHOWER AREA 71

          Wendy's SCREAM is all but DROWNED OUT by the SHOWERS.
          Rinsing off, Kim and Kelly hear nothing.

                         KELLY
          I think I'll let Drew do it.
          The door to the locker roor slowly opens behind them.

                         KIM
          Let him?
          She looks at Kelly. Neither girl hears the SQUISH of
          RUBBER SOLES moving across the wet tile floor.
          Suddenly there are LOUD VOICES. Melanie comes through
          from the locker room, laughing. Behind her, Wendy's
          ANGRY WORDS are AUDIBLE.

          WENDY (O.S.)
          If you ever try anything like that
          again, you cow!
          Melanie thinks it's hilarious.

                         MELANIE
          (to Kim and Kelly)
          You should've seen her jump...
          Nadia Comenici never did better...
          Wendy storms in. She's got the photo in her hand. She
          waves it at Kim and Kelly.

                         WENDY
          What's this supposed to mean?

                         KIM

                         (SARCASTIC)
          I know it's not much of a picture,
          Wendy, but you didn't have to go
          that far...
          Wendy is furious.

                         WENDY
          I didn't!
          She turns, glares at Melanie.

                         MELANIE
          Don't look at me...

                         WENDY
          You're all... children...
          She storms out. Melanie looks at Kim and Kelly,
          shrugs, follows Wendy. A DOOR SLAMS in the locker
          room.
          Kim and Kelly look at each other, laugh, turn their
          faces back to the steaming water. Neither one hears
          the SOUND across the room, a HARSH RHYTHMIC HEAVY

          BREATHING.
          Kelly bends her head away from the water, clears her
          eyes., She squints out through the steam at the big
          wall mirror across the room. She sees something. She
          steps back into Kim, her eyes wide with fear.

                         KIM
          Watch it...
          Kelly covers her breasts with her arms, presses against
          the wall, terrified.
          Suddenly there's an EXPLOSION of SOUND. Kim screams,
          jumps back, stares. There's a jagged hole in the cen-
          ter of the mirror, huge cracks radiating from it,
          spidering across its surface.
          For a moment no one moves. Splinters of GLASS TRICKLE
          down to the floor. There's no other sound. Kim grabs
          for her towel, steps out of the shower, looks. There's
          no one. She heads for the locker room door. Kelly
          runs after her.

                         KELLY

          72 INT. LOCKER ROOM 72

          Kim rushes into the room, Kelly right behind her.
          There's no one. Kelly is quivering. She clutches at
          Kim's arm. Kim looks at her.

                         KIM
          What did you see?
          Kelly just shakes her head.

                         KELLY
          Just... just... a shadow or.,.
          Kim heads for the exit door across the room. Kelly
          stays with her.

          73 EXT. SCHOOL 73

          Kim opens the outside door, peers down the walkway to
          the tennis courts, playing fields. There's no sign of
          anyone. She closes the door.

          74 INT. LOCKER ROOM 74

          Kim turns back.to Kelly who's started to cry.

                         KELLY
          Someone was there! Someone was...
          in there...
          Kim is taking charge. She moves cautiously back to the
          shower room door, opens it, looks in. She gasps.

                         KELLY

                         (CONTINUING)
          What? What!s wrong?
          Kelly's on the edge of hysteria. She runs over to Kim.
          They both look.

          75 KIM'S AND KELLY'S POV 75
          What the girls see is the mirror. Something has
          changed. A long wedge of glass has been lifted out o
          it.

          76 BACK TO SCENE 76
          Kim shuts the door, presses against it, stares at
          Kelly.

          77 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 77

          Kim walks quickly down a long school corridor and turns
          into her father's office.

          78 INT. OFFICE - DAY 78

          Kim enters. Adele Cooper is seated behind the secre-
          tary's desk thumbing through a fashion magazine.

                         KIM
          I'd like to see my f ather .

                         ADELE

                         (AGITATED)
          Is he here?

                         ADELE
          No, he's not. He said he'd be
          back but...
          She trails off. Kim is obviously upset.

                         ADELE

                         (CONTINUING)
          What's urrong?

                         KIM
          Oh... There was... Somebody broke
          a mirror in the shower room...
          There was somebody in there...

                         ADELE
          A mirror? Seven years bad luck...
          She tries to smile. Kim just looks at her.

          79 INT. HALLWAY - DAY 79

          Kim turns a corner, heading for class, and almost runs
          into Sykes, cleaning the floor. Sykes turns. For a
          moment their eyes lock. Then Kim hurries away, almost
          running. Sykes stares after her.

          80 INT. HALLWAY (WELLER'S CLASSROOM) - DAY 80

           Kim comes down the hallway and stops at the door.
           There's a piece of paper with a hastily scrawled mes-
           sage taped there. It heads: "Detention Postponed
           Until Monday -- EMERGENCY! Weller."

           VICKI (O.S.)
          Did it work?
          Kim is startled, turns. Vicki and Jude and approach-
          ing. Vicki hurries to the door, reads the note.

          She lets out a whoop, embraces Jude. Kim stands back,
          somehow less impressed.

          81 INT. GYM - DAY 81

          Several students are putting last-minute touches on the
          decor as Kim comes in. Huge speakers are being hoisted
          on pulleys to hang from the ceiling. A vast, raised
          platform covers much of the gym floor, its plexiglass
          surface designed to be illuminated from below. Perched
          on a ladder, Weller is hanging shimmering silver strips
          while Henri-Anne Benton supervises from the disco
          floor.

                         HENRI-ANNE
          Careful, Monty... A little
          higher...
          (sees Kim and

                         SMILES)
          I'm glad you could make it!

          Something came up...
          (looks at Weller)
          'Afternoon, Mr. Weller.

                         WELLER

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          Oh, hello, Miss... Hammond. I was
          just... uh...
          Henri-Anne mercifully interrupts him.

                         HENRI-ANNE
          Let's get started.

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Nick!
          Nick pokes his head out of the sound booth set on a
          platform near the stage.

                         HENRI-ANNE

                         (CONTINUING)
          Onstage! Tell Alex we're ready.
          Alex emerges from the booth. DAVY MATLOCK, a pudgy,
          fifteen-year-old sophomore and Alex's technical assis-
          tant, leans out behind him.

          Wonderful. You can be Mr. Hanunond
          for the rehearsal!
          Alex groans. Kim smiles as Nick joins her. She takes
          his hand, clutches it. They start to walk away, talk-
          ing quietly. Nick puts his arm around her.

                         HENRI-ANNE

                         (CONTINUING)

          Henri-Anne bounds up onto the stage. Kim and Nick fol-
          low her behind the curtain.

          82 INT. GYM (BACKSTAGE) - DAY 82

          Henri-Anne takes Kim to one of the wings of the dark
          cluttered area.

                         NICK)
          Nick?
          Nick silently creeps from behind a partition and moves
          up directly behind Henri-Anne. He mimes choking her, a
          crazed expression on his face. Kim has to laugh at his
          clowning.

          Hearing GRUNTS and GROANS from behind the desk, Kim
          steps around and sees Adele Cooper stretched across the
          floor. The secretary is practicing her "Rainbow" exer-

          Adele twists her head around to look at Kim. Her
          "Rainbow" collapses. Spinning around, Adele sits

          the Winston High Yearbook. She looks at it, reaches up
          and pulls it off the door. She winces, looks at her
          finger. It's bleeding. She looks at the picture.
          There's a tiny sliver of glass embedded in it.

          tices that nothing is being prepared for dinner.
          Curious, she moves toward the living room.

          90 INT. LIVING ROOM - DUSK 90

          Vivian is arranging fresh roses on the mantel shrine
          when Kim enters. The girl stands for several seconds
          watching her mother before she speaks.

                         KIM
          Hi, Mom.

                         (WITHOUT TURNING

                         AROUND)
          Hello, Robin. Don't eat anything.
          Dinner's almost ready.
          Disturbed, Kim frowns and slowly crosses the room to
          her mother.

                         KIM
          Nothing's cooking, Mom. You
          must've forgotten.
          Slipping out of her reverie, Vivian turns around to
          face Kim.

                         VIVIAN
          Oh.. I don't know what I was
          thinking.

                         KIM

                         (SMILES)
          It doesn't matter.

                         VIVIAN

                         (EXCITEDLY)
          Have you seen the new satin
          pantsuit I'm wearing?
          Vivian smiles at her daughter. Kim studies her for a
          long moment, then leans over and kisses her on the
          cheek.

                         KIM
          You'll be beautiful.

          91 INT. HALLWAY - HAMMONDS' HOUSE - DUSK

          As Kim walks down the hallway, she notices that Alex's
          door is closed. She enters her bedroom.

          92 INT. BEDROOM - DUSK 92

          Kim crosses the room and switches ON her RADIO. ROCK
          MUSIC is HEARD as she tosses her books onto the desk
          and moves to the closet. She carefully pulls out her
          prom dress, a mid-length, off-the-shoulder gown in a
          white, clinging material. Holding it up against her
          body, she inspects the gown in the full-length mirror
          on the closet door. Watching her reflection, Kim
          twirls around, hugging the gowm to her body. Satis-
          fied, she gently lays the go%.m on her bed.

          Kim begins to undress. Outside, the twilight shadows
          deepen.
          THROUGH the VINDOM, a slight movement is SEAN among the
          trees; suddenly, a dark figure becomes VISIBLE, ap-
          proaching.the window. Kim does not notice the figure
          as she finishes undressing. She wraps herself in a
          robe and sits at her dressing table.
          Putting her hair up, she does not see the shadowy
          figure peering inside. When Kim stands up, the figure
          slips away from the window. As she crosses the room,
          the face reappears, hidden by the shadows, watching her
          enter the bathroom.

          93 INT. BEDROOM - DUSK 93

          Wearing only a bra and panties, Wendy is sprawled
          across her bed, talking on the telephone. A black silk
          gown is draped across her legs.

                         WENDY
          (into the receiver)
          What I'm wearing now?... Oh,
          tonight!
          (smiles, gently
          stroking the gown)
          You'll find out soon enough.

                         (STIFFENS)
          Now, are we all set?... It better.
          I don't want her to ever forget
          tonight!... Okay, 'bye.
          Wendy hangs up the receiver and glances at her night
          table. A photograph of a grinning Nick McBride stares
          back. Wendy smiles and caresses her gown.

          94 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 94

          Seated at her dressing table, Kim puts the final touch-
          es on her makeup. Her hair is swept up and back, fall-
          ing in soft waves to her shoulders. Wearing the rav-
          ishing white gown, she looks older and very beautiful.
          Vivian's VOICE is HEARD from down the hall.

          VIVIAN (O.S.)
          Kim!
          Vivian comes in looking anxious and flustered. She's
          dressed in an elegant black satin pantsuit. Kim turns,
          looks at her.

          Mom, it looks great...
          Vivian doesn't seem to hear her. She's rummaging
          through her purse.

                         VIVIAN
          Kim, have you got any of my
          makeup?

                         KIM
          No... I never...

                         VIVIAN

          remember? You liked it...

          I wouldn't take it without asking
          you...
          Vivian's very wound up.

                         VIVIAN
          It was on my dressing table, I set
          it aside...
          She's looking around Kim's room as if she expects to
          see it.

          Why does this always happen at
          the last minute?
          Hammond's VOICE bellows from downstairs.

          HAMMOND (O.S.)
          let's go, we can't be late...

                         VIVIAN

          I set it aside...
          She heads for the door, stops, looks fully at Kim for
          the first time.

                         (CONTINUING)

          She goes out.

          95 INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT 95

          Hammond stands in front of a hall mirror, straightening
          his bow tie. He seems agitated, nervous. He turns as
          Vivian starts down the stairs. He looks surprised at
          her outfit. There's a certain similarity between it
          and his own formal suit.

                         HAMIM0ND
          My God, we're going to look like
          twins.
          Vivian stops dead, looks at him. Hammond forces a
          smile.

                         HAMMOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          I'm joking, Vi, it's beautiful.._
          C'mon...
          She hesitates, then comes down to him.

                         VIVIAN
          I told you I'd bought it.

                         HAMMOND
          Of course you did.
          He opens the door for her. She pauses to check herself
          in the mirror.

                         HAMMOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          we've got to go.
          He puts an arm around her, kisses her gently on the
          cheek. She just stares at herself in the mirror.

          96 EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 96

          Hammond takes Vivian's arm as they step outside, walk
          toward the car in the driveway.

          97 INT. PARKED CAR - POV 97

          Someone is watching Hammond and Vivian from a car
          parked across and just down the street. A shadow moves
          in the foreground, in the front seat of the car.

          98 EXT. HOUSE 98

          Hammond guides his wife to their family car, opens the
          passenger door for her_ He looks past her, down the
          street, sees a car parked there.

          A streetlight reflecting off its windshield prevents
          him from seeing inside. Vivian interrupts his
          speculations.

                         VIVIAN
          I'm going back to change.
          She turns back to the house. Hammond holds on to her
          arm.

                         HAMMOND
          Vi... there's no time...

          The figure in the front seat watches the confrontation
          in the Hammond driveway.

          100 EXT. HOUSE 100

          Hammond takes Vivian by the shoulders, faces her.

                         HAMMON D
          Vi.. this is a big night for the
          school, it's a big night for me...
          I know how you're feeling... I
          understand... It's difficult for
          all of us... But we've got to make
          a special effort, Vi... We can't
          let the... terrible memories of
          this day affect us... That may
          seem cold and... insensitive to
          you, but it's the way it has to
          be..
          He pauses, staring down at his wife. She's holding his
          gaze.

                         HAMMOND

                         (CONTINUING)
          Now, Vi, if you think it's going
          to be too difficult for you...

                         VIVIAN

          He's trying to stay calm, to keep the lid on. She's on
          the verge of tears.

          She glares at him. He releases her from his grip, ges-

                         HANMOND
          Let's get going...
          He walks around to the driver's door. Vivian stares
          after him with hard cold eyes.

          101 INT. PARKED CAR - POV 101

          The figure in the parked car watches as Hammond starts
          up the car, waits for Vivian to get in, backs out of
          the driveway, and moves off down the street.

          The figure climbs out of his car, gazes at the fading

          As she gently tracks the perf me across her skin, she
          is startled by another reflection in her mirror.
          Whirling around, she sees Alex. Standing up, she pir-
          ouettes and curtsies before her brother.

                         KIM
          Well?

          late.
          Alex takes the corsage. As he attaches the bright red
          flower on her gown, she playfully dabs perfume on his
          neck. He pulls back, pricking himself on the pin.

          er's face is revealed. It is the nine-year-old Alex.
          Kim cradles the killer on the ground. She turns his
          head toward the light. We SEE his face full-on.

                         VIVIA N
          Robin!
          She rushes forward, lunging for the body. Hammond
          grabs her, restraining her.
          Alex's dark eyes stare back unseeing at his family.
          His resemblance to his dead twin sister is uncanny.
          His hair falls onto his forehead in bangs, as Robin's
          had done seven years before. His makeup has been slop-
          pily applied. The rouged cheeks and the smudged red
          lips amplify the grotesque impersonation.
          Kim strokes her brother's hair. Hammond presses his
          hysterical wife to him. The onlookers slowly close in.
          We SLOWLY DISSOLVE FROM Alex's face TO a photograph of
          the Hammond family taken seven years earlier. We MOVE
          IN CLOSE ON the twins. Alex and Robin are smiling.

          FADE OUT.
