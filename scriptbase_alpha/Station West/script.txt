                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                                      JULY 22, 1947

                

               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY

               FADE IN

               The sky is pure blue, exquisitely blemished by huge cumulus 
               clouds, floating lazily. A single bird sails past. From the 
               sky the CAMERA MOVES TO earth. Here, too, all is tranquil. 
               The trees, bright green in the sunlight, move only to the 
               slight but constant breeze. Now the CAMERA MOVES DOWN, 
               revealing a wagon to which is hitched a team of horses beside 
               the road. The wagon is at an awkward angle, but upright. It 
               is wedged between two rocks where the horses have pulled it 
               as they tried to reach some forage. Its seat is empty. In 
               the bed of the wagon several sacks lie, bearing the legend:

                       From: Argus Mine - Rock Pass
                       To: U.S. Assay Office
                       San Francisco

               The sacks are empty and slashed as by a knife. The ropes 
               that bound them are cleanly severed. The disorder in the 
               wagon indicates haste. Two horses are hitched to it, munching 
               grass or the high leaves of a tree overhead. All that is odd 
               or unnatural is that the reins have fallen askew and trail 
               the ground.

               Now the CAMERA MOVES AWAY and ALONG tracks made by the wagon 
               when it left the road. ON THE ROAD two horses stand. These 
               are saddled, but riderless. The rifle holsters are empty.

               CAMERA MOVES TO the ground. There on the road lies the rifle. 
               The dust is slightly blowing across it, moved by the 
               persistent summery little breeze. From the rifle, the CAMERA 
               MOVES ON A LITTLE and STOPS ABRUPTLY ON the sprawled dead 
               figure of a soldier, then another, face down in the road.

               CLOSE SHOT of the dead soldiers, as the CAMERA HOLDS ON them. 
               Near the hand of one a revolver lies, the fine dust coating 
               it. Dust blowing over the uniforms, as though seeking to 
               hide the shame of a murder. As it blows over their still 
               figures, the SOUND of BIRDS coming over:

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN

               ROCK PASS - NIGHT

               This is a western mining town of the Eighties that has 
               mushroomed up around a gold strike. On the streets prospectors 
               and miners mingle with merchants. As the CAMERA PICKS UP the 
               scene, a lumber wagon passes, bearing logs, a ten team wagon, 
               its trailer filled with ore from the stamp mills and bearing 
               the legend: ARGUS MINE. A stage coach comes in as we:

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

               On the hotel clerk, as he sits behind the desk, playing a 
               guitar and singing pensively the ballad of the story. As he 
               sings, JOHN HAVEN, newly arrived on the stagecoach, walks 
               in, gazes at the clerk with a slight smile, finding the clerk 
               completely indifferent to the arrival of anybody, at last 
               leaves the bag and saunters out.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. SALOON - NIGHT

               As Haven leaves the hotel and has reached the saloon, a well-
               lighted, plush-looking spot, illumined by kerosene flares. 
               Sticking a pipe in his mouth, Haven saunters in.

               INT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - EVENING

               It is a huge elaborate room, lit by overhead chandeliers. A 
               long mahogany bar runs the length of it. To one side there 
               is a big stove and the gambling tables. Beyond can be seen 
               pool tables in an alcove. To another side, a man grinds away 
               at a piano. A stairway near the end of the bar leads to an 
               upper floor. The place is crowded and noisy with people. 
               Haven saunters towards the dice table, pauses, watches; he 
               is looking the crowd over carefully -- missing no detail of 
               the place or the people in it. When his turn comes, he picks 
               up the dice, bets all over the place -- on the line, on the 
               odds, on the seven, then on the come, the hard way, etc. His 
               point is eight.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Eight the hard way! Pay the line!

               Haven bets again, doubling all over the table.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Seven a winner.

               Players glance at the newcomer. Prince appears from nowhere, 
               standing behind the stickman, watching. Prince is slender, 
               black-haired, handsome and impassive. Haven throws again. 
               Stellman, an Army officer, watches curiously. There is a 
               little rising murmur as Haven tosses another natural. He 
               does it without enthusiasm or any lost movement. The bettors 
               get down on him. Prince touches the stickman's arm; the man 
               stands aside and Prince takes his place with the stick. Prince 
               tosses the dice back to Haven. Haven's eyes are fixed on 
               him. With a little smile, Haven throws the dice to the next 
               man, picks up his winnings.

                                     HAVEN
                         No, thanks...

               His eyes meet Prince's again and then he turns away, Prince's 
               gaze following him curiously, Stellman looks at Prince.

                                     STELLMAN
                         Know him?

                                     PRINCE
                         No. Why?

                                     STELLMAN
                         He just seems kind of free with that 
                         money.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Haven, as still smiling slightly, he heads 
               towards the bar, searching the faces of the crowd as he goes. 
               Two miners are squared off for a fight and Haven, going his 
               way, walks between them, very indifferent, not even glancing 
               back at the SOUND of scuffle behind him.

               AT THE BAR - Haven alone is not watching the fight. All the 
               others have turned to see it; even the barman is busy 
               watching. But Haven's eyes are resting on the figure of a 
               woman now at the piano, singing. Softly, as if to herself 
               and for her own enjoyment. He is near the end of the bar and 
               near the piano, and since no one else listens to her at this 
               moment, she sings, half smiling, directly for him, and then, 
               self-consciously, she stops and turns to sit at a table, as 
               Haven watches her. Behind them the fight is being stopped 
               and Charlie's eyes follow the huge bouncer, Mick Marion, as 
               he drags the offenders out to the door and the street. All 
               is as usual. The bartender is back at work. As Haven turns, 
               he finds that the place beside him is now occupied by the 
               young Lieutenant (Phil Stellman). Haven glances at the 
               uniform, then at the pleasant face of the officer, as the 
               barman comes up.

                                     HAVEN
                              (to barman)
                         Whiskey -- like you'd pour it for 
                         yourself.

               A girl sidles up to him, blonde, brash and pretty.

                                     BLONDE
                         Don't you know it's no fun to drink 
                         alone?

                                     HAVEN
                         Not till after the first one.

               He turns his back to her; she gives him a look and saunters 
               off. The barman produces the drinks -- a beer for Stellman, 
               the young officer. The barman folds his arms. Stellman looks 
               at Haven.

                                     STELLMAN
                         You a stranger here?

                                     HAVEN
                              (to barman, after 
                              gulping it in one 
                              gulp)
                         What kind of whiskey was that?

                                     BARMAN
                         On the bottle it says Rye -- but the 
                         way you take it, I don't see what 
                         difference it makes.

               Haven smiles at him.

                                     HAVEN
                         Another Rye.

               The barman turns to get it. Stellman is still looking at 
               Haven.

                                     STELLMAN
                              (easily)
                         You didn't answer my question.

                                     HAVEN
                         I'm a stranger everywhere.

                                     STELLMAN
                         Got a job?

               The barman gives Haven another Rye.

                                     HAVEN
                         Listen, soldier. I know that one, 
                         too. Got a job, stranger? No? Why 
                         don't you join the Army? Three meals 
                         a day, a place to sleep, a nice warm 
                         uniform --

                                     STELLMAN
                         It has a little more than that.

                                     HAVEN
                              (deliberately)
                         Yeah, it has one thing more, and 
                         that's what I could never take --
                              (looking at Stellman's 
                              stripes)
                         It's got Second-Lieutenants.

               The barman, listening, senses trouble and signals with his 
               eyes to a big bouncer down the bar. The bouncer moves up 
               quietly.

                                     STELLMAN
                         If you want to make it a personal 
                         matter --

                                     HAVEN
                              (coldly)
                         I don't make it anything, soldier. 
                         You tried to sell something and I 
                         didn't buy it -- so why don't you 
                         just beat it?

               They stare at each other for a long second, then Stellman 
               speaks icily:

                                     STELLMAN
                         If I weren't in uniform, I might 
                         teach you some manners.

                                     HAVEN
                         If you could teach me anything, you 
                         wouldn't be in a uniform.

               Stellman's jaw tightens; then he turns and exits abruptly. 
               The barman sighs with relief; the bouncer turns away.

                                     BARMAN
                         You couldn't be looking for trouble, 
                         could you?

                                     HAVEN
                         I could, but I'm not.

                                     BARMAN
                         That's fine, because this is one of 
                         the best places West of the Atlantic 
                         Ocean to find it.

                                     HAVEN
                         That was my first impression.

                                     BARMAN
                              (as Haven looks at 
                              him)
                         That Lieutenant's a nice young boy.

                                     HAVEN
                         I don't doubt it, but his mouth is 
                         too big -- like your ears.

               He turns away from the bar, after flipping a coin on to it, 
               while the barman stands there not knowing whether to be angry 
               or philosophical.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Haven, as he threads his way through the tables 
               towards the door. His eyes catch sight of the girl who sang 
               at the piano, Charlie. She is sitting at a table with Prince. 
               Prince murmurs to her and she glances at Haven, then looks 
               away again. Haven notes it. As he comes near the table, the 
               blonde who spoke to him at the bar, accosts him again.

                                     BLONDE
                         How is it now?

                                     HAVEN
                         What?

                                     BLONDE
                         Drinking alone?

                                     HAVEN
                              (flipping her a coin)
                         It's all right -- try it.

               Haven is looking at Charlie. She is checking a stack of coins 
               the blonde has turned in to her. She glances up with a 
               fleeting smile at Haven.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's not a good habit if it makes 
                         you pick fights.

                                     HAVEN
                         Only with Second Lieutenants.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We like Second Lieutenants here.

               Their gazes meet and Prince notes it with narrowing eyes. 
               The gaze holds like a spell, and then Charlie's smile comes 
               back, from nowhere.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You see -- here everybody fights, 
                         except the Army.

               Haven looks at her, fascinated. She can feel a fascination 
               herself. Now Haven smiles a little.

                                     HAVEN
                         I wouldn't know --

                                     CHARLIE
                              (still smiling)
                         So anyone who doesn't like the Army --

                                     HAVEN
                         I know what you mean, but I'm afraid 
                         I'll have to come back. I like the 
                         way you sing.

               She looks at him in a second's silence. Haven turns and 
               leaves. She watches him go. Prince studies her face, his own 
               grim. A croupier comes up and places a paper before her. She 
               hardly notices it.

                                     CROUPIER
                         Okay, Charlie?

               Charlie snaps out of it long enough to initial the paper.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's his limit.

                                     CROUPIER
                         There's a sucker getting hot with 
                         the dice at Ed's table.

               He turns away. Prince sits still, his eyes on Charlie, his 
               slim fingers at an habitual trick, that of idly stacking 
               dice in a little pillar and then picking the pillar aloft by 
               holding the lowest dice pinched between the thumb and 
               forefinger, NOT by the edges, but by the sides. Now he does 
               it as he watches Charlie's face. Her eyes glance again at 
               the disappearing back of Haven. The sense of fascination 
               seems to have gotten her, too. Then she realizes the presence 
               of Prince and his shrewd gaze. She looks at him coolly.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well -- cool him off.

               Prince flips the dice into his palm and rises...

               EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT

               The board sidewalk has given way to a rutty dirt road. Now 
               the racket of the saloon street is just a ghost of noise, 
               the road dark and silent. Haven has emerged from the saloon. 
               He glances up the street. Fifty yards ahead, Stellman is 
               walking slowly. Stellman pauses, shoots a quick glance 
               backwards, then goes on. Haven follows, going leisurely up 
               the street after Stellman.

               ANGLE on a corner as Stellman turns it, pauses and waits. 
               When Haven reaches it, Stellman goes on in silence.

               EXT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN - NIGHT

               As Stellman reaches it, pauses and glances behind him. Then 
               he rings a bell. Haven comes up and waits in silence, glancing 
               at the dark interior. A woman's face now peers through the 
               door window and then the door opens. Stellman enters quickly 
               and Haven follows.

               INT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN - NIGHT

               As Stellman and Haven follow Mrs. Caslon to a rear door. 
               Looking around, Haven notes in the shadows a desk and in a 
               corner the big safe. (This room is described in a subsequent 
               scene.) So as to emit the least light, Mrs. Caslon lets 
               Stellman and Haven go through, then quickly follows them and 
               quickly shuts the door.

               INT. MRS. CASLON'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               It is remarkably neat and elegant inside. As Haven, glancing 
               around, pauses inside, he finds himself facing a burly 
               uniformed cavalry officer, captain's bars gleaming on the 
               side of his collar. The captain is big and broad and scowling. 
               He is standing by the fireplace and his eyes are boring into 
               Haven's with curiosity and perhaps, suspicion. Stellman steps 
               forward as Haven and the captain are measuring each other.

                                     STELLMAN
                         Captain Iles -- the Commanding Officer 
                         of the Post.

               Haven gives a casual nod.

                                     STELLMAN
                         Mr. Haven -- sir.

               Iles looks him up and down. Haven hands him an envelope which 
               he slips into his tunic without removing his gaze from Haven.

                                     ILES
                         I see you finally got here.

                                     HAVEN
                              (pleasantly)
                         I seem to finally get everywhere.

               They eye each other, Iles scowling, Haven thinly smiling. 
               The sense of conflict is already between them.

                                     ILES
                              (introducing)
                         Mrs. Caslon, -- Mr. Haven.

               She nods and smiles warmly.

                                     ILES
                         You've met Mr. Stellman.

               Haven nods.

                                     STELLMAN
                         It came off beautifully. He picks a 
                         very good fight. In fact, I think 
                         I'm still a little sore at him.

                                     ILES
                              (grunting)
                         Sit down, Mr. Haven.

                                     HAVEN
                         Thank you, Captain.

               He sits down. Iles is still studying Haven.

                                     ILES
                         So you're operating under sealed 
                         orders.

               Haven nods agreeably.

                                     ILES
                              (disgruntled)
                         All this mumbo jumbo is characteristic 
                         of the Military Information 
                         Department.

                                     HAVEN
                         We use it as sparingly as possible.

               Iles pulls out a cigar, lights it, sizing Haven up.

                                     ILES
                         I've been in this territory for a 
                         number of years -- and I think it 
                         might be a little rougher here than 
                         a suburb of Washington, D.C.

                                     HAVEN
                         Very possibly.

                                     ILES
                         Then why is M.I.D. sending you out 
                         here?

                                     HAVEN
                         Because two soldiers have been 
                         murdered.

                                     ILES
                         And they think I can't handle that?

                                     HAVEN
                         They merely know you haven't.

               There is a tight little silence, while Iles formulates his 
               dislike for this newcomer.

                                     ILES
                         I have only ninety-four men on the 
                         post, with Indian trouble up north. 
                         The War Department has refused to 
                         send reinforcements, or am I boring 
                         you?

                                     HAVEN
                              (looking bored)
                         I'm not the War Department.

                                     ILES
                              (explaining)
                         The two soldiers were killed while 
                         escorting one of the gold stages.

                                     HAVEN
                              (quietly)
                         Is escorting gold a function of your 
                         command?

                                     ILES
                         Young man, the functions of my command 
                         look very pretty on paper, but they're 
                         not very practical in a territory 
                         like this. Do you have any illusions 
                         about that?

                                     HAVEN
                         I have no illusions about anything.

               Haven takes out his pipe and fills it.

                                     HAVEN
                         What's happening to the gold?

                                     ILES
                         I've permitted it to be stored in a 
                         warehouse on the post. Now everybody 
                         is waiting to see what I do next.

                                     HAVEN
                         What do you do next?

                                     ILES
                              (with sarcasm)
                         Aren't you here to tell me?

                                     HAVEN
                              (lighting the pipe)
                         Captain, you're in a bad way.
                              (going over to discard 
                              the match)
                         Wells Fargo won't convoy gold. You 
                         tried and failed and two men are 
                         dead. The gold is piling up on the 
                         post and you can't move it. Your 
                         post is under-manned. You want the 
                         Quartermaster at Platte to replace 
                         seventy uniforms sent to the freight 
                         office at West Rim City --

                                     ILES
                         The freight building burned down 
                         with the uniforms! I'm not operating 
                         a fire department -- and if I was, 
                         West Rim City is sixty miles away!

                                     HAVEN
                         That doesn't concern me either.

                                     ILES
                         What does?

                                     HAVEN
                         The killing of two soldiers.

                                     ILES
                         They were my men, Haven, and I'm 
                         trying every way I know to find out 
                         who murdered them.

                                     HAVEN
                         So will I.

               For the first time Iles looks amicably at him, as though 
               realizing that after all the man isn't there to criticize 
               him.

                                     ILES
                         You'll find it harder than you think. 
                         I don't know how you operate, but 
                         it's a dangerous job that can get 
                         you killed.

               He smiles slightly at Iles, who gives him a slight smile in 
               return, somehow intrigued by this nonchalance. Haven rises 
               from the chair, lighting the dead pipe in vain.

                                     HAVEN
                         Perhaps I can get some help from the 
                         Sheriff.

                                     ILES
                         You can forget him. He's a miserable 
                         man that somebody is using to keep 
                         the law a joke.

                                     HAVEN
                         You make it sound very difficult. 
                         Why don't you just wrap up your flag 
                         and take it back East with you?

                                     ILES
                              (smarting)
                         Tell me, how will I know what you're 
                         doing?

                                     HAVEN
                         I'll let you know from time to time.

                                     ILES
                              (coldly)
                         That's very obliging of you.

                         But I don't want to visit the Army

                         Then report to me through Mrs. Caslon 
                         here. You can be a friend of her 
                         husband's. He owned the Argus mine 
                         and died last year. If that meets 
                         your approval.

               Haven glances at Mrs. Caslon, smiles back at Iles.

                                     HAVEN
                         Only if it meets with hers.

                         I'd be delighted to help.
                              (she smiles at Haven)

                                     ILES
                              (grim at the smile)
                         Is that all?

                                     HAVEN
                         I think so.

               Iles marches out abruptly, followed by Stellman. The door 
               shuts. Haven smiles after him, then at Mrs. Caslon.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         He really isn't that abrupt -- he --

               The door opens again, smartly, Iles marches back in, kisses 
               Mrs. Caslon on the cheek.

                                     ILES
                         Goodnight, Mary.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                              (warmly)
                         Goodnight, George.

               Then he marches out again, shutting the door after him.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         You see?

                                     HAVEN
                         I see.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         I think he secretly likes you.

                                     HAVEN
                         He's a man who can sure keep a secret.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                              (smiles)
                         Would you like a little sherry?

                         Only if you have some too.

               She goes over to a sideboard and pours a little from a 
               decanter into two wine glasses. Haven watches her. For the 
               first time he realizes she is a very attractive woman. She 
               smiles as she brings him the wine.

                                     HAVEN
                         Thank you.

                         To your good luck.

               Haven nods and they sip.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         My mine -- The Argus.

                         That brings me to a question I decided 
                         not to ask.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                              (smiling back at him)
                         Then I'll answer it first. Captain 
                         Iles has asked me to marry him.

                              (quietly)
                         But you can't understand why Captain 
                         Iles should be involved in the gold 
                         business.

                         It isn't just mine. You must realize 
                         there's a lot of gold from all over 
                         the territory stored at the post 
                         warehouse.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         Perhaps as much as half a million.
                              (worried now)
                         In fact, I have about fifty thousand

                         I don't know... that's the worst 
                         part of it... not knowing.

                         I might find out.

               He starts for the door and she follows him. At the open door 
               he pauses.

                                     MRS. CASLON

                         Don't worry about it. Trouble and I 
                         are old enemies. We understand each 
                         other.
                              (he grins at her)
                         Goodnight.

                              (smiling again)
                         Good luck.

               Haven walks out and she closes the door thoughtfully and 
               turns away. In a moment the door opens and Haven reenters 
               and crosses to her much in the manner that we have seen 
               Captain Iles do so. Haven stops.

                                     HAVEN
                         You didn't tell me your husband's

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         Ben.

                              (repeating it)
                         Ben.

               He turns and goes out the door. Mrs. Caslon stands smiling 
               after him. The smile fades for a moment -- then she dismisses 
               it with a shrug.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

               As Haven saunters along. He pauses, glances up at a sign 
               that reads: HOTEL. Then he enters the dingy building.

               INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

               As Haven enters the small dismal lobby, and goes over to the 
               desk, where a little man, Orville Weekly sits, singing to 
               himself softly and strumming an accompaniment on a battered 
               guitar. As Haven stands there the clerk finishes the verse 
               about the stranger. Haven nods approval. The clerk looks at 
               him shrewdly.

                                     ORVILLE
                         Evenin' stranger.

                         Orville Weekly, and I can't be a 
                         total blank. I been here six years 
                         and I ain't dead yet.

                         Then it's eight bucks, cash in 
                         advance.

               Haven puts down the money; the clerk spins the registry to 
               him, watches as Haven signs it. And he can read that way.

                                     ORVILLE
                         From Arizona, huh?

                         going next -- so I won't forget.

               The clerk spits, hands him a key.

                                     ORVILLE
                         Room ten -- end of the hall. Make

                         back later.

               Haven crosses to exit into the street.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - NIGHT

               As Haven enters. It is crowded. Haven pauses by a table. He 
               sees Charlie at the piano singing. He sees Mick cross to 
               Prince and say something, then Prince gazes in his direction. 
               Haven's eyes meet those of Prince suddenly turned to him, 
               cold as glass. Charlie, seeing that Haven is watching and 
               listening to her impromptu singing, stops and makes her way 
               through the crowd towards a booth off the dance floor. Haven's 
               eyes follow her.

               MED. SHOT - of booth as Charlie sits down. A sandwich is 
               waiting for her. She takes a bite of it, then glances up to 
               see Haven standing beside the table.

                         I've changed my mind since I left 
                         here awhile ago. I don't want to 
                         pick a fight -- or break the bank -- 
                         or --

                              (evenly)

                         That's what I came back to find out.

               Charlie glances at him, then at the crowd where Mick Marion 
               stands beside Prince. Both are looking coldly towards the 
               booth. Haven's gaze follows hers towards Mick, as Prince 
               leaves the big man.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Maybe it would be better if you found 
                         another girl.

                         No, it wouldn't... I looked.

               She smiles slightly back at him, glances away towards Mick. 
               Haven looks too, curiously. Mick is still watching, coldly. 
               Others glance too, as though this were an unexpected thing. 
               Mick takes a drink from a passing waiter; kills it in one 
               gulp. Haven looks back at Charlie's face and smiles.

               The waiter nods and leaves. Charlie is still gazing at Haven 
               with that slight provocative smile.

                         I don't want to be a stranger, so 
                         I'll have to be foolish.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You like to take chances, don't you?

                         Then I'd advise you to try the dice 
                         table.

                                     HAVEN
                         I'd rather get lucky here.

                         own funeral.

                              (as the waiter sets 
                              down the champagne 
                              and glasses)
                         I could be your cousin from 
                         Waxahatchio. I could be cousin John, 
                         a missionary on his way to China.

               The waiter leaves, as Charlie still regards Haven with a 
               curious interest. Haven is glancing again toward Mick, just 
               as that animal barrels down another whiskey.

                                     HAVEN
                         He seems to be a lot of man.

                         The most in town.

               At this moment Prince comes into scene and sits at the table. 
               Haven looks at him but Charlie offers no introduction.

                                     HAVEN
                         It's a very small town.

                              around)
                         You could get it all in this saloon.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We usually do.

                         So Charlie probably runs the town.

                                     PRINCE
                              (toying with his dice)
                         Why do you care?

                                     HAVEN
                         I'm going to spend some time here. I 
                         want to know who winds the clock.

               He glances up and a slow smile comes over his face as Mick 
               Marion is seen approaching deliberately and with cold menace. 
               Her eyes follow his, then back to his face.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's been a nice conversation. I 
                         hate to have it end.

               Blank-faced and big, Mick arrives at the booth. He stares 
               from Charlie to Haven. Haven looks at him then at Charlie. 
               Charlie watches Haven's face, but the smile remains. It seems 
               to sway her, this little test of expression.

                                     MICK
                         Who's this?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (after a taut pause)
                         Mick -- this is -- cousin John.

                                     HAVEN
                              (relieved)
                         From Waxahatchie.

               Mick is not quite sure.

                                     MICK
                         What's keeping him?

                                     PRINCE
                         I think he's wondering if he couldn't 
                         do more good here.

               Haven senses now it is a little game they're playing together 
               on him. His smile remains. He reaches for the bottle, his 
               hand grasping the base of it, just as Mick reaches for it 
               too, clenching the top. Mick lifts at it; Haven's hand holds. 
               They look at each other as this little game of strength goes 
               on.

                                     MICK
                         You aren't very friendly, are you, 
                         mister?

                         You ought to learn not to pick 'em 
                         so easy, like you do your cousins.

                              (coolly)
                         I never saw him before in my life.

               That does it. Mick wrenches at the bottle, and as he does 
               so, Haven releases his grip. The bottle shoots up. The wine 
               spills over Mick's face and clothes. Infuriated, Mick flings 
               the bottle at Haven, but Haven ducks as he comes out of the 
               chair. The bottle crashes against the wall, and Haven's fist 
               crashes against Mick. The big man grunts and staggers back, 
               but he doesn't drop. As Haven sets himself, he is suddenly 
               pinned from behind by two bouncers. Mick stands still, staring 
               at him, his cut lip bleeding.

                                     MICK
                              (icily)
                         You're too little to make that big a 
                         mistake.

                         You want to correct me or just bleed 
                         at the mouth?

               There is a dead silence. At the crap table the dice read 
               seven but no one looks at them, all turning toward the scene. 
               A minor rises and the girl on his lap hits the floor. A drunk 
               steals a drink and no one sees him. (Business with glass) 
               Prince looks on coldly. Mark Bristow, moving up from the 
               dice table, pauses and stares.

                                     MICK
                              (coldly)
                         Bring him outside.

               The two bouncers start with Haven toward the door, Mick 
               following. A rear rises and men begin following in their 
               silent wake. Only the guy at the piano keeps on playing: he 
               never stops.

               ANGLE on Charlie as she rises. Bristow and Prince have 
               sauntered over to her as the place empties, leaving only the 
               piano player.

                                     BRISTOW
                         What happened?

                              (casually)
                         A misunderstanding.

                                     PRINCE
                         Did you find out what he wants?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (starting out)
                         He wanted to be my cousin.
                              (they follow her)
                         Only I haven't any aunts or uncles.
                              (still casually)
                         But you never know -- and the least 
                         I can do is bury him.

               Prince lets go with one of his rare smiles as he looks 
               admiringly at Charlie. They reach the door. The crowd opens 
               for them a little.

               EXT. SALOON - NIGHT

               As Mick and Haven come out; the crowd makes a noisy clearing. 
               There are bets going down. As soon as the crowd has formed 
               an open space, Haven wheels and smacks Mick across the face 
               hitting with the heel of the hand, so that Mick rocks back 
               almost going down. There is dead silence. Mick sets himself 
               for the Kill, as he peels his coat.

               Bristow is shaking with excitement.

                                     BRISTOW
                         Mick will kill him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's ten to one.

                                     BRISTOW
                              (grinning)
                         I don't like the other fellow's 
                         chances, but I'm a sucker for odds.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You should always bet on a champion. 
                         Then you can only lose once.

                                     BRISTOW
                         You give ten to one...?
                              (she nods)
                         I'll take it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're down. A thousand to a hundred.

               As they stare at the fight --

               FULL SHOT - fight scene. As Mick is slowly advancing toward 
               Haven. He suddenly swings a haymaker which Haven easily ducks, 
               another and another that Haven evades.

                                     HAVEN
                         Don't miss so much. You'll got tired.

               Mick misses again, fiercely and Haven cracks him one in the 
               midriff. Then steps out fast and waits.

               Mick charges and Haven catches him full in the mouth. It 
               stops Mick, and then Haven socks him again, this time with 
               the butt of his hand -- open palm -- on the nose. Mick is 
               surprised, tasting the blood on his hurt lips.

               ANGLE on Charlie, Mark and Prince, as they watch. Charlie's 
               eyes are fixed with a kind of admiration on Haven. Prince 
               watches without interest. Mark is tense and excited.

                                     BRISTOW
                         He can fight a little.

                                     CHARLIE
                         A little won't be enough.

               But you feel she wishes it might...

               ANGLE on the fight.

                                     MICK
                         Stand still and fight.

               As Mick closes again, Haven stops quickly to one side, 
               clipping him behind the ear as he goes by. But this time 
               Mick keeps after Haven and finally connects. It is more of a 
               push than a clean hit, but even so the force of it drives 
               Haven off balance and he sprawls on his back. As Mick, sensing 
               victory, charges, Haven knows he can't get to his feet in 
               time, so he turns his body and springs at Mick's knees 
               shoulder first. The impact spills Mick on his face; before 
               he can recover, Haven dives on him, hands flat on his own 
               chest and palms turned out. His body crashes heavily, angling 
               across Mick's head, and Haven's savagely pushing hands mash 
               the other man's face into the hard ground. Then he rolls 
               clear and comes to his feet, breathing easily, waiting. Mick 
               gets up, shaking his head to clear it, mad and hurt. As he 
               closes ponderously in on Haven, his booted foot suddenly 
               shoots out. Haven twists his knee cap away but takes the 
               blow on the inside of his thigh, numbing the leg so that he 
               almost goes down. And now Mick gets to him. His great arms 
               close around Haven's waist, his hands locked in the small of 
               Haven's back. Haven braces himself against the crushing 
               squeeze, tensing his back muscles and stiffening his spine, 
               but there is nothing he can do against the implacable brute 
               power of the other man.

               The sweat stands out on Haven's face as Mick's great strength 
               bends him over farther and farther. He must do something, 
               and soon, or his back will be cracked like a barrel stave. 
               Suddenly he bends his knees and lifts his feet up from off 
               the ground. Mick, suddenly finding Haven's full weight pulling 
               him forward, crashes down on top of him. With all the strength 
               left in him, Haven brings his knee to the pit of Mick's 
               stomach; as Mick's hold breaks, Haven rolls clear.

               Now they are both hurt. Haven's ribs and chest are so bruised 
               that it is agony to take a breath. He knows it has to end 
               quickly or he is done for, and he goes all out. As Mick tries 
               to close with him again, he stands his ground and throws 
               pile-driver punches to Mick's midsection; as Mick finally 
               lowers his arms to cover his body, Haven shifts his attack 
               to the face. This is not Mick's style of fighting, but as he 
               lashes back clumsily and angrily, each time he touches Haven 
               it is with punishing power. Toe to toe, they slug it out, 
               the belt now unwound and dangling from Mick's fist, both men 
               groggy but both refusing to go down. Finally Mick is helpless 
               to protect himself, but Haven hasn't got power left to knock 
               him off those sturdy legs. Gathering himself, Haven hurls 
               his body shoulder first at Mick's chest but he miscalculates, 
               glances off and falls flat on his face. As he rolls over, 
               dogged and slow with exhaustion, he sees that his weight has 
               staggered Mick; the big man has taken a step back, and now 
               he starts to walk forward. Dazed and blind with pain, he 
               passes Haven, staggers forward until the tie-rail stops him. 
               There he stands, his hands on the rail, moving his head from 
               side to side like a wounded animal.

               The crowd is silent now, waiting. Haven gets to his feet, 
               drunk with weariness. He puts a hand on Mick's shoulder, but 
               hasn't the strength to whirl him around. He braces himself 
               with one hand against the tie-rail, and almost in slow motion 
               pulls Mick around and clips him one last time with his 
               remaining strength. Mick goes down.

                                     MICK
                              (getting up very slow)
                         You can't do this.

               Before he is up he goes down again, unable to make it.

                                     MICK
                              (in the dirt)
                         Nobody can do this... to me.

               The crowd is transfixed. They can't even cheer. The two 
               bouncers lean over the fallen Mick.

                                     BOUNCER
                         Somebody just did.

               They pick up Mick as Haven stupidly watches. Then as Haven 
               turns and goes away, swaying and weak, the roar rises. He 
               pushes aside people who try to assist him. They move aside 
               and watch him leave. The crowd goes back in the saloon behind 
               the vanquished Mick...

               ANGLE on Charlie, Bristow and Prince. Prince watches the 
               beaten Mick go by with a smile of contempt. Charlie's eyes 
               are fixed on the vanishing lonely figure of Haven. Mark's 
               eyes are dancing.

                                     BRISTOW
                         I can't believe it. Mick Marion losing 
                         a fight and me winning a thousand!

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to Prince)
                         Give it to him, Prince -- in chips.

               Bristow follows Prince, wiping his forehead. Charlie remains, 
               looking down the now empty street where Haven vanished, a 
               strange soft look in her eyes, a slow smile mounting her 
               lips.

               INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

               Orville behind his desk is strumming softly on the guitar, 
               his eyes following Haven as the latter slowly and somewhat 
               painfully walks in and across the lobby. All the way to the 
               desk the clerk watches Haven, strumming softly. Haven pauses 
               and smiles very faintly at him. The clerk puts the guitar 
               aside. There is a coffee pot and cup on the desk.

                                     ORVILLE
                         Have some coffee?

                                     HAVEN
                              (leaning on the desk)
                         Thanks.

               Orville pours it quickly.

                                     ORVILLE
                              (turning back to pick 
                              up a pitcher and a 
                              bottle)
                         They told me who was fightin'. I was 
                         getting ready to rent your room. 
                         Cream or sugar?

                                     HAVEN
                         Cream.

               Orville pours the "cream" from a whiskey bottle. Haven sips 
               gingerly.

                                     ORVILLE
                              (looking with mild 
                              curiosity and 
                              admiration)
                         Myself, I'd rather fight a forest 
                         fire.

                                     HAVEN
                              (softly)
                         So would I...

               He finishes the coffee, turns and starts for his room. Orville 
               tosses two towels on Haven's shoulder as the latter goes. 
               Strumming the guitar again softly, he watches with admiration 
               the retreating form of Haven.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Haven stands in the darkness only lighted by lights of the 
               saloon next door. He stands there looking vaguely out the 
               window, sucking his knuckles absently as he listens to the 
               piano playing. Then he goes wearily to the bed and falls on 
               it gratefully, shutting his eyes, the towels still across 
               his shoulder. There is a moment of silence and then a soft 
               KNOCK at the door. Another KNOCK, and painfully Haven lifts 
               himself on one elbow and drags out his gun. The door opens 
               and Charlie enters. She shuts it behind her and stands looking 
               at him. He lets the gun fall and turns over on his back. 
               Charlie walks across to the bed and stands looking down at 
               him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         How do you feel?

                                     HAVEN
                         Like a million dollars.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You just cost me a thousand. You 
                         lost your pipe in the fight. I brought 
                         it to you.

               She puts it on the table beside the bed. Haven's eyes follow 
               her. She sees the towels, takes them to the washstand, soaks 
               them and brings them back and compresses them gently on 
               Haven's bruised face. When she takes the towel away, he pulls 
               himself up a little, propped against the pillow, looking at 
               her curiously. She sits down on the edge of the bed.

                                     HAVEN
                         Do you always get sweet with the men 
                         who fight over you?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Only the winners.

               He watches her as she wets the towels again, returns and 
               wraps his hands in them, sitting again on the edge of the 
               bed.

                                     HAVEN
                         Tell me something --

                                     CHARLIE
                              (quietly, smiling)
                         What?

                                     HAVEN
                              (he lies back)
                         That fellow might have killed me --
                              (sleepily)
                         Where do you bury the losers?

               He is almost asleep. She takes the now unused towel and puts 
               it back in the basin, soaks it, returns with it and tucks it 
               against the side of his face.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You talk too much.

                                     HAVEN
                              (bitterly)
                         What do you want -- the next dance?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I think you'd better sit this one 
                         out.

               He is sound asleep the next second. She stares at him; rises, 
               puts the blanket over him and goes quietly out.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

               Haven comes to the desk from his room. Orville is singing 
               another verse of the ballad. The clerk favors Haven with an 
               admiring smile. The coffee pot is there.

                                     ORVILLE
                         Have some coffee?

                                     HAVEN
                         Thanks.

               Orville strums the strings as Haven drinks, having a little 
               trouble with his sore hands.

                                     HAVEN
                         The way you run this dump I knew you 
                         must be good at something else.

                                     ORVILLE
                         Some call me the town poet -- and 
                         some the village idiot. Who am I to 
                         question either? How you feel today?

                                     HAVEN
                         Like I crawled here from Kansas City.

                                     ORVILLE
                         Well, it figures to make you pretty 
                         famous. Fact, people been askin' for 
                         you already.

                                     HAVEN
                         Who?

                                     ORVILLE
                         That gold mine lady -- Mrs. Caslon.

                                     HAVEN
                         That's nice.

                                     ORVILLE
                         Couldn't do better. And Charlie.

                                     HAVEN
                         Charlie?

                                     ORVILLE
                         No. less.

                                     HAVEN
                         You seem impressed.

                                     ORVILLE
                         Why not? Charlie owns a piece of 
                         everything, includin' the undertaker 
                         and the sheriff.

                                     HAVEN
                         The stage line too?

                                     ORVILLE
                         Everything but the Wednesday Bible 
                         Class. Even owns a piece of me.
                              (grins)
                         Takes your money while you're here, 
                         and makes you pay to leave.

                                     HAVEN
                              (putting down the cup)
                         When you get the next verse I'd like 
                         to hear it.

                                     ORVILLE
                         Can't find no word to rhyme with 
                         Mick Marion.

                                     HAVEN
                              (as he turns away)
                         Carrion.

               He walks off. Orville ponders this, scowling into space.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. MRS. CASLON'S MINE-CABIN

               Iles is pacing the floor. Mrs. Caslon is occupied with some 
               minor domestic chore. Stellman is standing by the door. Iles 
               is a ball of fire.

                                     ILES
                         Of all the stupid bonehead plays! 
                         What did he fight about -- don't 
                         tell me a woman?

                                     STELLMAN
                         That's what they tell me.

                                     ILES
                         Who started it?

                                     STELLMAN
                         I don't know, but Haven finished it.

                                     ILES
                         That probably strikes you as a very 
                         admirable thing.

               Stellman shrugs.

                                     ILES
                         Well, I don't think so! I have men 
                         who can use their fists. Why didn't 
                         they send a man who could use his 
                         brains!

               There is a knock at the door. Iles gives her a look; then 
               glares at Stellman.

                                     ILES
                         Well -- open it up!

               Stellman opens the door and Haven walks in. He pauses, glances 
               around and smiles. Mrs. Caslon smiles at him.

                                     HAVEN
                         Hello, Mrs. Caslon.

               She smiles and nods. Irons. Haven can feel the surcharged 
               air. Deliberately he assumes that casual manner that so burns 
               the Captain.

                                     HAVEN
                         Captain... Lieutenant...

                                     ILES
                              (coldly)
                         Mr. Haven, we may not have very much 
                         around here that pleases you, but we 
                         do have a strict post regulation 
                         against brawling in the town. Now 
                         would you like to explain what 
                         happened last night?

                                     HAVEN
                              (smiling)
                         I came here to return Mrs. Caslon's 
                         call.

               Iles glances sharply at Mrs. Caslon, and then to Haven.

                                     ILES
                              (indicating a chair)
                         Sit down.

               Haven sits, wincing a little. But he beams at Iles, who now 
               picks a book off the table.

                                     ILES
                         This book I have in my hand is the 
                         Army Register, 1882.

               Haven inspects his knuckles.

                         I am now going to read from it.
                              (finds the place; 
                              reads)
                         "Haven, John Martin, born Ohio 1852. 
                         Appointed Second Lieutenant. Promoted 
                         First Lieutenant 20th Infantry, March 
                         1880; reduced in rank to 2nd 
                         Lieutenant January 12, 1881."

               He tosses the book on the table, glaring at Haven.

                         Is that correct?

                         It's the Army Register.

                         Haven, you've lost your rank once. 
                         It may very well happen again.

                                     HAVEN

                         Maybe if you'd let him explain... He 
                         might have a good reason.

                                     ILES
                         Even a bad reason would delight me.

                         Those things can become very vague.

               Iles scowls to him.

                              (shrewdly)
                         And where do you expect all this to 
                         get you?

                              (rising wearily)
                         That is a question I prefer not to 
                         answer.

                                     ILES
                              (snaps it)
                         I think you're trying to carry your 
                         authority too far.

               Haven goes to the door, gently touching his sore jaw. At the 
               door he turns.

                                     HAVEN
                         Perhaps, but there's one thing, 
                         Captain Iles... We had an arrangement 
                         that we wouldn't meet -- you and I --
                         except through Mrs. Caslon... I think 
                         it's important to keep it that way...
                              (one more glance back)
                         And I like it better.

               He smiles and leaves, closing the door as he goes. Iles stands 
               there frozen with rage a moment. Then his face relaxes in a 
               grim smile. He glances at Stellman as he takes a cigar out 
               and bites it off.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. SALOON - DAY

               Business is slack. Girls drink coffee and knit at a table. 
               Ernie polishes glasses at the bar. A colored man cleans a 
               crap table. All look up with curiosity and esteem as Haven 
               enters; all but Sam, the piano player, who goes on playing. 
               Haven goes to the bar. Ernie nods at him.

                                     HAVEN
                         Doesn't he ever stop playing?

                         Sam? It don't bother him. He's deaf.

                         Where do I find the boss?

                         First door top of the stairs.

                         Mick been around?

                         He's undisposed.

               Haven goes to the stairs. The eyes of the girls follow him.

               Top of the stairs -- as Haven reaches the door, wincing at 
               the climb. He KNOCKS with the heel of his hand, hurts it, 
               then uses his boot toe.

                                     PRINCE'S VOICE
                         Come in.

               Haven opens the door.

               INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAY

               This is a big corner room, the windows of which look out 
               over the main street. The chairs are big and there is a roll-
               top desk in the corner, a big leather sofa, and on the walls 
               some framed pictures. At a table Prince sits. He has six 
               dice stacked on top of each other and he is lifting the 
               column. Charlie is seated behind the desk smiling. Haven 
               looks from one to the other.

                         I did.

                         They said Charlie --

                         Yes.

               She seems to enjoy Haven's momentary confusion. Prince is 
               indifferent.

                                     HAVEN
                         You're Charlie?

                         That's right.
                              (nods toward Prince)
                         This is Prince. Don't ever gamble 
                         with him.

                         You mean with his equipment?

               Prince gives him a thin smile and rises.

                                     PRINCE
                         She means either.
                              (he crosses to door)
                         See you later, Charlie.

               Prince saunters out.

               Haven sits in a big chair, very gingerly; takes out his pipe 
               and tobacco.

                                     HAVEN
                         You surround yourself with very 
                         affable characters.

                         It makes me feel at home.

                         You're not that sinister. Last night 
                         with the wet towels you were Florence 
                         Nightingale in silk stockings.
                              (stretching his legs, 
                              looking at her)
                         Have you got a match?

               She comes over with one and lights his pipe.

                                     HAVEN
                         There's one in my pocket but I hate 
                         to reach for it... thanks.

               She takes his hand and looks at the cut knuckle.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sit there.

               She walks out of the room and he watches her; then around 
               the room. In a moment she returns, pulls up a chair in the 
               front of him and sits down. She has bandages and a little 
               jar of ointment.

                                     HAVEN
                              (smiles)
                         Now you're Florence Nightingale again.

               She takes one of his bruised hands, and as she bandages his 
               hands slowly, carefully and rather expertly, they talk.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why did you pick that fight?

                                     HAVEN
                         I thought you did.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (smiling)
                         Really?

                                     HAVEN
                         You could have insisted I was your 
                         cousin.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Perhaps that isn't the way I felt 
                         about you.

                                     HAVEN
                              (as his knuckle hurts)
                         Ouch!

               She smiles at him and then goes on.

                                     HAVEN
                         Where did you get the name of Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                         It was my father's. My name is 
                         Charlene, but --

               He watches her face.

                                     HAVEN
                         I like that better... Charlene...

                                     CHARLIE
                              (giving him a glance)
                         What makes you think you're going to 
                         work for me?

                         How's that?

               She stands up. Haven looks at her and ignores his bandaged 
               hands.

                         get a table. Sometimes they run out

               As she writes out the authorization, Haven saunters to the 
               window, then over to the desk. Charlie finishes and hands 
               him the paper. Haven scans it, pockets it.

               Haven is moving to the door and she beside him. They pause.

               He looks at her face, neck and hair. She looks pretty good.

                         Only with money.

               Haven looks squarely at her a moment, then smiles. He reaches 
               out one bandaged hand and pats her shoulder.

               He walks out, and Charlie remains standing there, staring 
               after him, just a little hazily.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               As Haven walks through the wide gate into a compound. There 
               are several unhitched stages and freight wagons, one or two 
               in partial disassembly and being serviced. A colored boy is 
               readying a horse and buggy and beside him, overlooking the 
               yard activities, is a bespectacled man with rubber sleeve 
               garters. He is the manager. He has eyes like Armadillo and 
               claw-like hands; otherwise, he could be your loan agency 
               man. Seeing Haven he crosses to him.

               The manager glances at the note, after moving his spectacles 
               out of the way. He gives it back without a word, and turns 
               toward the rear office door. Haven halts him.

                                     HAVEN
                         Wait a minute. You're not fired.

                         I got to be. There ain't enough work

               Jim Goddard and Jerry enter from the rear office door. Jerry 
               is the younger. Goddard walks a little stiffly with the aid 
               of a cane.

                         Mr. Leonard!

               They halt and look at Haven. The Manager jerks a thumb at 
               Haven.

                                     MANAGER
                         Talk to him. He just took the reins.

                         right, Mr. Haven?

               Haven nods, after a glance at the manager.

                         Yes, sir.

               He walks out, looking back with an awesome smile. Haven looks 
               curiously at Goddard, who has been standing in silence, a 
               thin smile on his lips.

                         Yes, sir.

               He obeys. Haven watches and then turns to the manager.

                                     HAVEN
                         I'm coming back later and sit behind

                         Only things here that work.

               The manager, gives them to him. Then looks at him.

                         Son, I waste my time. I might as 
                         well waste some advice. You're full

                         I might depend on something besides

                         Well the fact that they don't seem 
                         to shoot too straight.

                                     MANAGER
                         They don't need to when they shoot 
                         so often.

               He turns, takes a few steps -- and turns back to Haven.

                                     MANAGER
                         Worry it over.

               The manager turns to go, shaking his head.

               EXT. OFFICER COMPOUND

               Haven, whistling softly, crosses to the colored boy who is 
               polishing the last specks of dust off the buggy. It is a 
               beautiful buggy attached to a beautiful horse. Haven pauses 
               and gazes at it.

               Charlie is dressed to go somewhere. She looks much nicer in 
               these clothes than in her show garments of the night. She is 
               listening to Prince who sits in a chair, the inevitable dice 
               in his fingers, two this time. There is a silence except the 
               rattle of the cubes. Then Prince speaks coldly.

                         Does this Haven move me out? Is that

                                     CHARLIE
                         Prince, you know I wouldn't part 
                         with you.

                                     PRINCE
                         But I always come up empty.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not quite empty. I gave you what is 
                         probably the one honest feeling you 
                         ever had in your life.

                                     PRINCE
                         I keep forgetting that. Pardon me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What's the matter, Prince?

                                     PRINCE
                         I don't like John Haven or anything 
                         about him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You've said that.

                                     PRINCE
                         What do you know about him?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You want me to have him looked up in 
                         the Social Register?

               She gets up, goes to the window testily. Prince looks at her 
               coldly as she gazes at the street.

                                     PRINCE
                         A man walks in out of nowhere --

                                     CHARLIE
                              (turning)
                         And went against your table. Did he 
                         play like a gambler?

                                     PRINCE
                         He knew something.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes -- and he took Mick.

                                     PRINCE
                         So he can fight.
                              (shrewdly)
                         You like that part, don't you?

               He looks straight at her and she stares back, staring him 
               down at last. As his eyes lower, she turns again to the 
               window.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'll tell you one thing, Prince, I 
                         don't like this part.

               She is silent and Prince gets up and walks out. She does not 
               turn. Down in the street she can see Haven riding up in the 
               buggy, and the hard look on her face softens to a smile as 
               Haven climbs out of the buggy. Some people passing stare at 
               him, and whisper together. His fame has spread. He walks 
               inside, smiling a little.

               INT. SALOON - DAY

               As Haven enters. There is no play at the tables. Some at the 
               bar. The deaf pianist is pounding the keys softly. Prince 
               has just descended the stairs and gone to the dice table, 
               where he leans, his cold eyes fixed on Haven as the latter 
               goes to the foot of the stairs. At this moment Charlie appears 
               and descends the stairs, adjusting her hat. Haven stares at 
               her with admiration, as she descends, smiling at him.

               MED. SHOT - Haven and Charlie, as she reaches the last step.

                                     HAVEN
                         Stand there a second.

               She looks at him.

                                     HAVEN
                         Every time I see you, you look 
                         different, but you always look 
                         beautiful. Why is that?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I always have somebody to lie to me.

                                     HAVEN
                         Take my hand --
                              (offering it)
                         But don't squeeze it.

               She takes his arm instead and they walk towards the door.

               MOVING SHOT - Charlie and Haven, as they go.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Tell me what you're doing with my 
                         buggy.

                                     HAVEN
                         My work. I'm the new transportation 
                         boss. You hired me.

               MED. SHOT of Prince, as he stands at the table, watching 
               them go.

               EXT. CHARLIE'S BUGGY - DAY

               As Haven helps Charlie into the carriage.

                                     HAVEN
                         I presume you're going shopping?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I wouldn't wear anything sold this 
                         side of Chicago. I'm going to call 
                         on a gentleman.

                                     HAVEN
                         At this hour?

                                     CHARLIE
                         His name is Mark Bristow -- and any 
                         hour, it would be strictly business.

               He glances at her.

                                     HAVEN
                         The way you say it -- he may need a 
                         lawyer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's a lawyer himself, but it won't 
                         help him.

                                     HAVEN
                         No?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (with a smile)
                         What good is a lawyer if he never 
                         gets in a court?

                                     HAVEN
                         Like a doctor in a graveyard. Where 
                         is this unlucky man?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Across the street.

               As Haven shrugs and turns the carriage to front of Bristow's 
               office.

               EXT. BRISTOW'S OFFICE - DAY

               The letters on the window read:

                                   Mark Bristow, Lawyer

               As Haven pulls up in front of it with the carriage. He goes 
               around and helps Charlie alight, making it a little slow for 
               the sake of added intimacy and causing her to smile as though 
               she didn't resent it.

                                     HAVEN
                         Shall I take the horses back and rub 
                         them down?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Do you think they've gone far enough?

                                     HAVEN
                         I haven't.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Then maybe you better wait and come 
                         with me.

               As Charlie starts in, Mrs. Caslon comes out and they pass. 
               Mrs. Caslon pauses to smile and Haven tips his hat. Charlie, 
               flashing a backward look, sees this.

               EXT. BRISTOW'S OFFICE - DAY

               MED. SHOT of Haven and Mrs. Caslon. Haven is talking to her 
               with apparent casualness because he realizes that Charlie 
               can see him.

                                     HAVEN
                         I wonder if you'd do me a favor?

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         Why, surely.

                                     HAVEN
                         It's a big favor, and I wouldn't 
                         blame you if you refused.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         What is it?

                                     HAVEN
                         I want to haul some gold from your 
                         mine.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         That IS a big favor.

                                     HAVEN
                         I know it seems impossible to you, 
                         but that's one reason why I'm here -- 
                         to find cut what makes it impossible.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         Isn't that very risky?

                                     HAVEN
                         That's why I couldn't go to anyone 
                         but you.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                              (hesitating)
                         I'm just wondering if we shouldn't 
                         speak to Captain Iles first.

                                     HAVEN
                         You know what he'd say.
                              (she smiles grimly 
                              and nods)
                         He'd advise against it -- but if it 
                         works my way, it may clear everything 
                         up -- for all of us -- and for Iles 
                         too. The War Department doesn't like 
                         all that gold around an Army Post.

               He watches her face as she thinks it over.

                                     HAVEN
                              (softly)
                         We're working too much in the dark. 
                         This may be the only way to see 
                         something. It's a risk -- but someone 
                         has to take it...

                                     MRS. CASLON
                              (firmly)
                         Who else will know of it?

                                     HAVEN
                         Just us. That'll be all who know -- 
                         and that's the idea.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                              (simply)
                         I'll arrange it.

                                     HAVEN
                              (grinning)
                         Don't look so grim. It's only your 
                         gold and my skin. And smile when you 
                         walk away as though we'd been talking 
                         about what a dry summer it's been.

               She smiles and Haven pats her shoulder.

               INT. OFFICE - DAY

               As Bristow is talking. Charlie, looking through the window, 
               sees Haven and Mrs. Caslon part, Haven patting her shoulder 
               with that familiar gesture of his, then coming into the office 
               door.

                                     BRISTOW
                         ...You know I'll always cooperate -- 
                         as much as possible. But I haven't 
                         the money.

               Haven has entered in silence, seated himself in a chair. 
               Charlie does not look at him; her face, hard now, looks 
               straight at Bristow. He pauses as he glances at Haven with a 
               little nod Haven doesn't return.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (rising and going to 
                              the desk with a sheaf

                              places on his desk)
                         These are I.O.U.s for gambling. They

                         My luck can turn, can't it?

                         Not on my tables.

                                     BRISTOW
                         I've seen other people fall in this 
                         trap -- but I didn't think it would 
                         get me.

               He is sweating a little.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Nobody does. I'll have Prince drop 
                         in and go over your books. Maybe we 
                         can work something out.

                                     BRISTOW
                         But I told you --

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's the way it is, Mark. I pay 
                         off on the line and I expect to get 
                         paid. Give it some thought.

               She whirls and walks out the door. Haven, fumbling for his 
               pipe and putting it in his teeth, follows her with a parting 
               glance at Bristow. For a long minute Bristow sits there alone, 
               his eyes staring at nothing; then as he mops the mildew of 
               sweat from his forehead:

                                                                       WIPE

               INT. CHARLIE'S CARRIAGE - DAY

               As Charlie and Haven drive in the country. The road winds 
               between hills now and a stream tumbles along beside the 
               winding road. The horse is moving at a snail's pace and 
               Charlie is gazing around at the scenery, relaxed and 
               thoughtful.

                                     HAVEN
                         You know, you remind me a little -- 
                         back there -- of a character I once 
                         read in a book.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I had an idea you'd read a book. 
                         What was the character?

                                     HAVEN
                         Simon Legree.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Mark is mixed up. He's either crooked 
                         without being smart, or honest without 
                         being lucky. And that's no good.

                                     HAVEN
                         I don't think I'd want to owe you 
                         money -- even if I was honest.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Even?

                                     HAVEN
                         When I was seven I robbed my own 
                         piggy bank.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's hard to imagine you being seven.

                                     HAVEN
                         I was very fat and ate a lot of candy.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Is that why you robbed your bank?

                                     HAVEN
                         No... I robbed it to run away from 
                         home.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Did you do it?

                                     HAVEN
                         Yeah, but I had to go back.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why?

                                     HAVEN
                         It got dark.

               She laughs. They stop and get out.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               STREAM BANK - DAY

               FULL SHOT as Haven helps her down the bank to the edge of 
               the water. She sits on the edge of a huge flat boulder and 
               Haven stretches out beside her.

               MED. SHOT of Haven and Charlie. As she looks at the stream 
               and then at him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is my favorite place in the 
                         world... I always come here to think 
                         about it.

                                     HAVEN
                         What?

                                     CHARLIE
                         The rook here and the stream. The 
                         stream is always running away and 
                         the rock is always watching it go. 
                         It's two ways to be -- and I always 
                         wonder which is the best.

                                     HAVEN
                         They probably envy each other.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Do you suppose any woman could envy 
                         me?

                                     HAVEN
                         I know it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         But not a good woman?

                         Nobody is any good. You mean 
                         respectable.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Maybe.

                         Respectable people are very useful -- 
                         but they bore me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         With certain exceptions.

                         Like who?

                         Like Mary Caslon...

                                     HAVEN
                         I thought we might get to that.

                                     CHARLIE
                         How did you happen to know her?

                                     HAVEN
                         I knew her husband.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's curious, considering --

                                     HAVEN
                         Considering what?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ben Caslon was a very upright citizen.

                         Meaning I'm not?

                              (adds thoughtfully)
                         She's certainly not hard to look at -- 
                         and now she has the money and is --
                              (looking away)
                         -- also very respectable.

                                     HAVEN
                         Then why would she be interested in 
                         me?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Because you're no good. And good 
                         women like men who are bad for them.

                                     HAVEN
                         Flattery will get you nowhere.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Fooling with her will get you nowhere 
                         too -- except in trouble.

                         The army. Why is it you're always 
                         getting mixed up with the army?

               Haven has been idly flipping pebbles into the stream. He 
               sees a leaf float by.

                                     HAVEN

                         What are the odds I hit the leaf?

                                     CHARLIE

                              misses)
                         What's the army got to do with Mrs. 
                         Caslon?

                         She's engaged to Captain Iles.

                         He's the army boss here.

                              (smiling)
                         If you're going to frighten me, the 
                         least you can do is hold my hand.

               He holds out his hand and takes hers. Abruptly she starts to 
               rise, very piqued and unable to disguise it. Haven rises 
               too. Takes her hand to help her from the boulder. Then stops 
               and gazes at her, smiling.

                                     HAVEN
                         This is where you ought to slip -- 
                         and I should catch you and kiss you.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No chance.

               She starts down; Haven moves too, but it is he who slips and 
               she who has to catch him. Her arms go automatically around 
               him. His around her. Before he can act himself, she holds 
               him tight and kisses him. It is a long kiss and on it we:

                                                                   FADE OUT

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING

               Orville is strumming the guitar as Haven enters. He pauses 
               as Haven comes near on the way to his room.

                         Maybe so. I thought I'd tell you. 
                         Goin' back to your room will be a

                         buggy ride, but somebody came and 
                         took all your truck.

               He strums the strings.

                         And, naturally, you didn't do anything

                         I paid my rent and I think I'm

                         thief.

               INT. HAVEN'S ROOM

               Haven enters, glances around, sees the bag is missing. He 
               goes to the window, sees Charlie at saloon window across the 
               areaway. He leans out.

                                     HAVEN
                         Hey!

               Charlie moves the window, smiling.

                         You didn't imagine that I'd let you 
                         live in that hotel, did you? I want 
                         you available -- in case of trouble.

                         Where did I move?

                                     CHARLIE
                         In a very nice room upstairs.

                              (taking out his pipe)
                         When can you get my things back to 
                         the hotel, Charlie?

               She stares at him, the smile fading on her face.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why don't you take them yourself?

                                     HAVEN
                              (calmly)
                         Because that's not how they got here.

               A slight pause.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're really hard -- aren't you?

                                     HAVEN
                         No.

                         You have to play everything alone?

                                     HAVEN
                         This hotel is no good. The service 
                         is bad. The clerk's a poet, and the 
                         mattress is not quite as soft as a 
                         marble slab. But I'm beginning to 
                         like it... and if I open this window, 
                         and hear you singing...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Is that the way you want it?

                         That's the way.

                         They'll be there.

               She turns abruptly from the window. Haven smiles and turns 
               away.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. STAGE LINE COMPOUND - NIGHT

               Haven is finishing preparations for the ride. ANGLE ON Goddard 
               as he stands in shadow, watching. He carries a shotgun. As 
               Goddard moves from the shadow, Haven whirls, going for his 
               gun -- then relaxing as he recognizes the other man.

               MED. SHOT of Haven and Goddard.

                                     HAVEN
                         What brings you here?

                                     GODDARD
                              (smiling)
                         I had a dream.

                                     HAVEN
                         Yeah?

                                     GODDARD
                         That you'd be back here tonight.

                                     HAVEN
                         Why?

                                     GODDARD
                         Maybe because you took the keys.

                                     HAVEN
                         Don't they go with the job?

               Haven stares at him a long moment; Goddard returns the stare 
               steadily.

                                     GODDARD
                         You know how it is with dreams. I 
                         got the crazy idea you were going to 
                         try something --

                                     HAVEN
                         How crazy?

                                     GODDARD
                         Like running a shipment.

                                     HAVEN
                         Then what happened?

                                     GODDARD
                         I wanted to be some help with it.

                                     HAVEN
                         All right -- you've been some help. 
                         Now you can go back to sleep and 
                         I'll finish the dream for you.

               The coach is ready. Goddard doesn't move.

                                     GODDARD
                         I'm riding with you, Haven.

                                     HAVEN
                         You are?

                                     GODDARD
                              (grimly)
                         I'm riding.

                         You got more than your leg hurt, 
                         didn't you?

                                     GODDARD
                         Maybe I just like to ride in the 
                         moonlight if nothing happens.

                                     HAVEN
                         And if it does?

                                     GODDARD
                         Then I think I got a little better 
                         right than you to be there.

                                     HAVEN
                              (gazing at him)
                         I was just thinking -- a nice guy 
                         like you probably has a nice girl 
                         somewhere -- or a wife.

                                     GODDARD
                         What are we gonna do -- have a little 
                         chat about women?

               Haven slowly grins at him; Goddard smiles back.

                                     HAVEN
                         Some other time -- Let's go -- out 
                         the back gate.

               Goddard climbs up with his shotgun as Haven clambers up into 
               the driver's seat. As the coach turns and heads for the back 
               of the corral.

                                                                       WIPE

               EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - NIGHT

               FULL SHOT - the stagecoach, travelling across open flat 
               country, heading toward the distant hills.

               CLOSE SHOT - Haven and Goddard in the driver's box, keeping 
               an eye about him as the teams gallop along in the moonlight.

                                     HAVEN
                         What makes you so anxious to take 
                         this chance?

                                     GODDARD
                         What makes you?

                                     HAVEN
                         I'm on commission. With me it's a 
                         matter of money.

                                     GODDARD
                         And you think it's something else 
                         with me?

                                     HAVEN
                         I can't think of anything else -- 
                         except curiosity.

                                     GODDARD
                              (gazing out drily)
                         Some moonlight after all...

               FULL SHOT as the stage rockets off into the darkness.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. MOUNTAIN COUNTRY - NIGHT

               The stage is now heading uphill, the gentle slope at the 
               beginning of the foothills.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN COUNTRY - NIGHT

               The road is steeper now, and winding.

               ANOTHER ANGLE. The road is cut out of the side of the 
               mountain, leaving a sheer slope on one side, and high, thick 
               trees and brush on the other. As the stage follows a bend in 
               the road, a rider leaps out and grabs the lead horse. The 
               stage lurches crazily and almost overturns as it slows to a 
               stop. Before Haven can free his hands from the reins to go 
               for his gun, two shadowy figures, handkerchiefs helping the 
               darkness mask their faces, have jumped out onto the road 
               ahead and have him covered.

                                     BANDIT
                         All right -- stretch!

               Haven and Goddard raise their arms. Another bandit, from the 
               hillside, calls out:

                                     SECOND BANDIT
                         Pile out with the hands up.

               Two shotgun barrels cover the side of the stags. Goddard 
               gets off, hands in air.

                                     FIRST BANDIT
                              (to Haven)
                         Get down.

               Haven obeys, to join Goddard in the road, as the bandits 
               converge on the stage. There are five or six of them. Two 
               come up behind Haven and Goddard.

                                     FIRST BANDIT
                         Turn around and keep 'em high.

               The sacks are being loaded on a pack horse. Haven turns 
               around.

                                     HAVEN
                         Take it easy. They hang you just the 
                         same.

                                     SECOND BANDIT
                         You, Goddard, start walking.

               He gives Goddard a none too gentle shove. Goddard moves on 
               up the road in the darkness.

               A FEW YARDS UP THE ROAD. Mick is waiting by his horse, his 
               gun drawn. We hear the steps of Goddard and the bandit.

                                     SECOND BANDIT'S VOICE
                         That's far enough.

               The footsteps halt. Mick aims and fires.

               BY WAGON. There is a half grunt, half groan from Goddard. 
               Haven turns as if to protest and then crumples as a gun fells 
               him.

               CLOSE SHOT - Haven, lying face down on the ground, 
               unconscious.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN

               EXT. SKY

               As day breaks.

               EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAWN

               CLOSE SHOT - Haven. Haven comes to, gradually clearing the 
               cobwebs. Then suddenly he remembers Goddard and the shot. He 
               makes his way to where Goddard's body lies a few feet up the 
               road. Goddard's right hand is half in his hip pocket, as if 
               in his last dying moment he was reaching for something. As 
               Haven pulls the hand out, he sees that Goddard's fingers 
               have closed around his wallet. Puzzled, Haven opens the 
               wallet. There is a stiff-backed daguerreotype of his wife, 
               an expired Union Pacific Railroad pass, an express receipt, 
               a souvenir bank-note of the Confederacy, and a small, closely-
               folded piece of paper. Unfolding this, Haven sees the top 
               line:

               "To Whom It May Concern"

               HE READS FURTHER:

               "This certifies that the bearer, James Goddard, is operating 
               as a legally deputized detective for Wells Fargo Stage and 
               Express Company."

               Haven replaces the papers and lifts Goddard's body, carries 
               it to the stage and places it on the floor. He removes 
               Goddard's gun and shell belt and straps it on, closing the 
               stage door. Haven's face is grim as he studies the ground 
               nearby. The sticky mud shows clearly the new tracks of the 
               bandits' horses. As he starts unhitching one of his horses 
               from the wagon traces, we

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. MOUNTAIN COUNTRY - MORNING

               A tiny clearing on a brush-filled knoll, where the remains 
               of a cooking fire are still visible, the ashes scattered 
               over the tamped-down ground. CAMERA PANS OVER TO Haven, on 
               horseback, as he studies the scene. This is where he evidently 
               made camp for the night. He dismounts, sifts the ashes through 
               his fingers to feel their warmth. He cannot be far behind. 
               Then he turns his attention to the trail loading away. 
               Inspection reveals that it divides, one group of fresh tracks 
               heading towards town, another smaller group further into the 
               mountains. He decides to follow the latter. As he mounts and 
               rides off:

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. MOUNTAIN COUNTRY - MORNING

               A high spot from which Haven can get a good view. Off in the 
               distance he sees:

               LONG SHOT - FROM his ANGLE. A lone rider, leading a pack 
               horse, barely visible through the timber. He is heading away 
               from him.

               CLOSE SHOT - Haven. He spurs his horse forward.

               FULL SHOT - Haven, in pursuit of the man ahead.

               EXT. STREAM - MORNING

               The bandit, unaware of his pursuer, puts his horse and the 
               gold-laden pack horse through the stream. He comes out into 
               a meadow on the other side.

               PAN SHOT - WITH Haven, as he comes to the stream. Half way 
               across, his horse momentarily loses his footing on the 
               slippery rocks.

               MED. SHOT - bandit. Hearing the noise of Haven's horse, he 
               turns and sees his pursuer, takes a quick shot back at him, 
               then heads for the other side of the meadow where there will 
               be shelter, firing back as he rides.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - Haven. He takes careful and deliberate aim 
               and fires.

               FULL SHOT - FROM Haven's ANGLE. The bandit is almost at the 
               edge of the woods when Haven's shot gets him. He tumbles 
               from the saddle. Haven rides forward, gun ready in case it 
               is a trick.

               EXT. MEADOW - MORNING

               It is no trick. The bandit is down where he fell. When Haven 
               turns him over, the man's eyes are already glazed. Haven 
               puts his lips close to the dying man's ear.

                                     HAVEN
                         Who sent you?

               The man only glares up at him. Haven tries again.

                                     HAVEN
                         You're a goner, brother -- you can 
                         talk.

               The man holds Haven's gaze defiantly and silently as the 
               life goes out of him. Haven lowers him back to the ground, 
               rifles his pocket. There are no papers on him, no 
               identification. He stands up. He has the gold back, but he 
               is no closer to rounding up the whole gang than he was before. 
               Unless -- he is looking at the horses, placidly grazing. He 
               goes up to them, ties up the loose lead reins, draws his 
               belt off, and gives them each a sharp crack on the rump with 
               the buckle. They take off across the meadow at a gallop. 
               Haven lets them get a good start before he mounts his own 
               horse, and follows after them.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. MOUNTAIN COUNTRY - DAY

               As Haven rides up to the edge of a downslope, gazes over a 
               broad valley, and sees:

               LONG VIEW of a sawmill, nestled in the valley. It comprises 
               several sheds and buildings, with a long rank of stacked 
               logs beside the biggest shed, and all this is serviced by a 
               dirt road along which the two horses canter up to the camp. 
               Haven observes several men come out of the main office and 
               snag the two horses.

               EXT. CAMP OFFICE - DAY

               As two men who have snagged the horses now take off the gold 
               bags. In front of the office Pete, the camp boss, Ben and 
               Sam, two tough-looking accomplices, stand watching and 
               glancing up the road down which the horses came. There is a 
               frown on Pete's face.

                                     BEN
                         Where's Joe?
                              (as Pete doesn't answer)
                         Something's gone wrong, Pete.

               Pete looks thoughtfully at Joe's horse, pats his neck, again 
               locks up the road.

                                     PETE
                         I know one thing. He was born on a 
                         horse and he didn't just fall off 
                         this one... go and take a look.

               Two men mount and start away.

               CLOSE SHOT of Haven. As he moves back out of sight. Obviously 
               he can't move into the camp now. Glancing off down the valley 
               he sees in the distance a work wagon approaching. It is still 
               hidden from sight of the sawmill by high ground between. He 
               puts his horse down the slope towards the approaching wagon, 
               at a tangent to the camp.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. SAWMILL ROAD - DAY

               As the work wagon lumbers along. Its markings identify it as 
               belonging to the stageline Haven now manages. We recognize 
               Jerry the driver as Haven rides up. Jerry gives him a grin 
               and a salute.

                                     JERRY
                         Hello there, Mr. Haven!

                         Hello, Jerry. What's the haul?

                                     JERRY
                         This is that load of grub for the 
                         sawmill.

                                     HAVEN
                         Want to ride my horse back to town?

                                     JERRY
                         What about the wagon here?

                                     HAVEN
                         I'll finish the haul.

                                     JERRY
                         You're the boss.

               He climbs down as Haven dismounts and turns the horse over 
               to Jerry.

                                     HAVEN
                              (throwing it away)
                         Any excitement in town?

                                     JERRY
                              (grins)
                         Don't know, Mr. Haven. I left before 
                         daybreak.

                                     HAVEN
                              (relieved)
                         Take him easy. He's tired.

                                     JERRY
                         I'll give him a good rubdown.
                              (mounting)

               Haven watches him ride away, then climbs aboard the wagon. 
               Picking up the reins, he notices the bandages on his hands 
               and, not wanting to be identified by them, rips them off. 
               Blowing on his still sore knuckles, he drives toward the 
               sawmill.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. SAWMILL CAMP SITE - DAY

               As Haven's wagon lumbers in. He looks curiously at the main 
               office. No one is in sight, but as he draws nearer, the 
               swarthy hard-faced man, Pete, comes out on to the porch.

                                     PETE
                         Hey, you!

               Haven looks at him.

                                     PETE
                         You see a rider comin' up?

                                     HAVEN
                         Nope.

                                     PETE
                         You sure?

                                     HAVEN
                         Haven't even seen a lizard. Where do 
                         I put this stuff?

                                     PETE
                         Where did you put it before?

                                     HAVEN
                         I never did. I'm a new driver. I 
                         think it's grub.

                                     PETE
                         Take it to the cook shack.

               Haven flicks the reins, moves on. Pete watches suspiciously. 
               Haven moves on to the cook shack outside of which the cook 
               is busy dumping a pail of slop.

                                     HAVEN
                              (pulling up)
                         You the cook?

                                     COOK
                         Nah. I just wear this hat to keep 
                         the flies out of my hair.

                                     HAVEN
                         It don't matter to me, brother. I 
                         just haul this grub. I'd just as 
                         soon haul it back.

                                     COOK
                         Take it next door.

               Haven pulls up by the warehouse next door and gets down. 
               There is nobody around, so he starts wrestling with the food 
               crates himself, taking the first one into the warehouse.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

               It is big, barnlike, piled with provisions and equipment. 
               Haven stares around; carries the crate to where a similar 
               stack of crates are piled. Lowering the crate he notes a 
               shiny object, picks it up. It is a button from an army 
               uniform. He pockets it as his attention is distracted by two 
               horsemen passing outside. Haven goes out to continue 
               unloading.

               EXT. MAIN OFFICE - DAY

               As the two horsemen ride up to Pete and dismount. Ben and 
               Sam are standing there.

                                     PETE
                              (to the horsemen)
                         Any luck?

                                     BEN
                         No sign of Joe. But there's the tracks 
                         of another horse, circling the mill 
                         and coming back on the road just 
                         north.
                              (he points)

                                     PETE
                         That's bad.

               He glances toward the wagon where Haven is working.

                                     PETE
                         Let's go and look at this guy again.

               The five men move down to Haven's wagon.

               ANGLE ON wagon and Haven, as he sees them come. His lip 
               tightens; then he relaxes and goes on lifting a crate. He 
               pauses as they come up and stand around him, their eyes fixed 
               on:

                                     PETE
                         You --

               Haven looks at him.

                                     PETE
                         You sure you didn't see no rider?

                                     HAVEN
                         Look -- you want me to say I saw a 
                         rider? I'll say it. I'll say I saw a 
                         ghost. It don't make any difference 
                         to me.

                                     PETE

               It is a risky little moment; Haven eases both bruised hands

               Pete's face relaxes; as do the grim faces of the others.

               They start unloading and Haven goes to the cook house. Pete

                         He don't look any worse than the 
                         rest of it looks right now.

                         Come on, get this junk out.

               He lends a hand with Ben and Sam.

               INT. COOKHOUSE - DAY

               A big pot of stew is simmering on the fire. The cook is busy 
               slicing french fries. Haven enters.

               Haven begins ladling out some stew into a bowl, tastes it.

               Haven shrugs and takes more stew; the cook goes on cutting 
               the potatoes.

               EXT. SAWMILL OFFICE - DAY

               Pete, Sam and Ben are waiting beside the gear box as we see 
               Haven bringing the wagon up.

                         Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

               They watch Haven as he pulls up the wagon. Pete looks hard 
               at his face. Haven has the pipe in his mouth again, looking 
               very blandly at them.

               Haven climbs aboard. They look hard at him. He has stuck his 
               pipe in his mouth. He smiles at them and he picks up the 
               reins.

               Haven flicks the reins, grins at them and drives off. Ben is 
               still worried and stares after the departing wagon.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY

               This is deserted country on the way to town. When the land 
               slopes steeply from the road down into a kind of wash, Haven 
               halts the wagon. He glances around. No sign of life. He takes 
               a hammer and chisel out of the tool box beside the seat, 
               crawls to the crate and prys it open. His cargo is gold. 
               Satisfied, he replaces the pried board, then pushes the crate 
               over the side. It topples down the bank, vanishes in the 
               brush at the bottom of the wash. With one more glance around, 
               Haven resumes his seat in the wagon, puts a match to his 
               pipe, and sends the horses forward at a faster clip.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

                         Why, everybody. They found Goddard's 
                         boy -- didn't you know that? What 
                         happened? Tell me about it.

                         I'm glad you got your voice back.

                                     BRISTOW
                         If you're trying to imply that you 
                         frightened me, coming here like this, 
                         you're right. I'm neither a hero nor 
                         a fool.

                              (shrewdly)
                         They killed Goddard -- Why didn't 
                         they kill you?

                                     HAVEN
                         Somebody must have wanted me saved.

                                     BRISTOW
                         What for?

                                     HAVEN
                         I don't know. Maybe a rainy day.
                              (dryly)
                         Only it might never rain.

               Haven puts the gun away; rises, walks to the desk, pours a 
               drink for himself. Mark watches him shrewdly.

                                     BRISTOW
                              (himself again)
                         And what do you want from me?

                         I'm going to make a statement, which 
                         you will write and notarize.

                                     BRISTOW
                         Is that all?

                                     HAVEN
                         Yes -- except that you put it away 
                         where it can't be stolen or tampered 
                         with.

                         Meaning you don't trust me.

                         I do -- but I don't think you trust

                                     BRISTOW
                         Where do you want it?

                         Mrs. Caslon has a safe -- a nice fat 
                         one.

                                     BRISTOW
                         I think I can arrange it.

                         All right -- here's the statement.

               He saunters to the window -- glances through the crack of 
               the shades. When he turns, he notes that Mark has paper and 
               pencil ready.

                                     HAVEN
                         I solemnly swear that on Thursday 
                         last, about eleven p.m. the stagecoach 
                         in which I was riding was held up by 
                         five armed bandits. The gold I was 
                         hauling was stolen and James Goddard, 
                         the guard, was murdered in cold blood.

               He pauses, looks stonily at the face of Mark, who is staring 
               at him curiously and waiting.

                                     HAVEN
                         I trailed the bandits, caught up 
                         with one and -- killed him.

               Mark stares in amazement.

                                     HAVEN
                         Put it down.
                              (as Mark obeys)
                         I then followed the horses bearing 
                         the gold to a sawmill --

               EXT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - EVENING

               Mick is standing outside, holding the arm of Jerry as he 
               talks to the kid. Beside him stands Pete Yore's man, Ben.

                                     MICK
                         You sure it was Haven you met?

                         Don't I know my own boss?

               INT. MARK'S OFFICE - EVENING

               As Haven finishes his statement. He is again at the window, 
               glancing out. Perhaps he has seen the incident with Mick and 
               Jerry across the crowded street.

                                     HAVEN
                         ...After I left there, I opened the 
                         crate. The gold was in it.

               He turns back into the room. Mark is looking at him with 
               puzzled wonder, his face drawn and tense.

                                     HAVEN
                         That's all.

               He smiles slightly. The wonder leaves Mark's face. Urbane 
               cunning replaces it.

                                     BRISTOW
                         Not quite.

                         I came to the conclusion that I 
                         finally had enough money to need a 
                         lawyer.

               Mark smiles thinly, licking his lips.

                                     BRISTOW
                              (needing a drink again)
                         Have you seen the sheriff?

                         came to you.

                         I see. Well, as a lawyer, my advice 
                         would be --

                         I didn't come here for advice.

               He strolls back towards his room and CAMERA FOLLOWS him, the 
               strumming of the guitar again SOUNDING in the b.g.

               INT. HAVEN'S ROOM - EVENING

               Haven shuts the door, pulls off his boots and gun belt, lies 
               on the bed and stares at the ceiling. His face is sad and he 
               looks tired. The MUSIC from the saloon comes over, Charlie's 
               song... he closes his eyes and in a moment falls asleep...

                                                                       WIPE

               As iles rides up. He is just about to enter, after 
               dismounting, when Mark Bristow comes out of the office. Mark 
               smiles and nods at the officer.

               As Iles opens the door and enters. Mrs. Caslon is her usual 
               cool self as she sits at her desk. Iles crosses to her and 
               gives her a peck on the cheek as she fondly pats his hand.

                                     ILES
                         Good evening, Mary.

                         I just passed Bristow.

                              (ignoring this)
                         Why don't you sit down. You look 
                         tired.

                         I should.

               He sits in a comfortable chair, conscious of the fact that 
               she had ignored his reference to Bristow.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         I suppose you've heard the news. The 
                         holdup and poor Jim Goddard.

                         I heard it -- last, as usual.

                         Why don't you smoke?

               Iles gives her a surly look, takes a cheroot out of his tunic.

                         The gold Haven tried to run was from

                         Yours!

               Iles is about to yell something at her, then holds himself 
               in check, while she wipes the spilled ashes from his uniform. 
               In this interlude he changes to an icy man.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         Now don't excite yourself.

                         I am very calm, and I calmly ask you 
                         how you could allow that scoundrel

                         The man you call a scoundrel may be 
                         dead at this moment.

                         And he may be in town at this moment -- 
                         where, in fact, he is.
                              (looks at her)
                         How you could do this without telling 
                         me --

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         I only did it for your sake.

                                     ILES
                         MY sake?

                         After all, Mr. Haven represents the 
                         U.S. Government.

                         Who do you think I represent?

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         I told you, George, I was only trying 
                         to help you.

                                     ILES
                              (containing his fury)
                         And while we're on the subject, who 
                         does Mark Bristow represent?

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         You know perfectly well that he's my 
                         lawyer.

                                     ILES
                         I know perfectly well he's a scoundrel 
                         too.
                              (rises)
                         Is he also trying to help me?

               He walks to the door. She stands there frigidly.

                                     ILES
                              (at the door, a ball 
                              of cold fire)
                         Thank you, Mary.

               He turns and fumbles with the knob, but he can't do it. He 
               turns at last and walks meekly back to her.

                                     ILES
                         I'm sorry. I'd say that I lost my 
                         head if I believed that I had one.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                              (kissing him fondly)
                         It's my fault George.
                              (turning)
                         Mark left me something.

               She turns to the desk and hands him the long legal envelope. 
               Iles takes it and stares at it. He starts to open it.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         You're not going to open it?

                                     ILES
                         To whom it may concern. That's what 
                         it says here.
                              (going on)
                         Well, it may concern me.

               He opens it, looks.

                                     ILES
                         It does.

               He hands it to her. She reads.

                                     ILES
                              (grimly)
                         My business isn't jammed up enough -- 
                         so they send this harebrained demoted 
                         lieutenant pry around in it... They 
                         want to help me too.

               He takes back the paper from her, thrusts a blank sheet in 
               the envelope, tosses the envelope back on the desk.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         George -- you're getting to be a 
                         hard man to deal with.

                                     ILES
                         I'm getting to deal with some hard 
                         men.

               Iron-faced, he starts out, remembers again, softens against 
               his will, comes back from the door and kisses her cheek and 
               then leaves. CAMERA stays on Mrs. Caslon as she watches him 
               go. She smiles slightly, puts the envelope in the safe, and 
               then from it takes a six-gun, looks at it and begins dusting 
               it with her handkerchief as we

                                                                   DISSOLVE

                                     BRISTOW
                         You certainly are a careful man.

                         I have to be. I live a careless life.

               Haven begins washing his face in the washbowl, and then 
               combing his hair and readjusting his somewhat rumpled shirt. 
               Mark watches him.

                                     HAVEN
                         What about the deposition?

                                     BRISTOW
                         She has it. It's in her safe.

                                     HAVEN
                         Good.

                         What do we do now?

                         We call on Charlie.

               There is a little nervous sweat on Mark's hands; he wipes 
               them on his coat.

                                     BRISTOW
                         It's a dangerous play, Haven.

                                     HAVEN
                         Is it?

                         What if she doesn't believe you?

                         That deposition could be a lie. It 
                         might not stand up in a court.

                         That's it. You're a lawyer and you're 
                         not sure. Then how can she gamble on 
                         it, either?

                                     BRISTOW
                         Because she's a gambler.

                                     HAVEN
                         No, she isn't.

                         We're the gamblers, Mark. Lot's go.

               A little shaken and uncertain, Mark obeys.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. HOTEL - EVENING

               As Haven and Mark come out. They walk towards the saloon. 
               People look at them curiously. Suddenly, down the street, 
               the sheriff appears, approaching Haven slowly and ominously. 
               Sensing a gun fight, people vanish. Purely from instinct, 
               Mark deserts Haven's side in a hurried walk towards the 
               saloon, eyeing both. Haven comes on leisurely. The sheriff 
               has stopped in his tracks and has his gun out. A woman 
               clutches her child to her skirt. Men stand stockstill, 
               watching. A crowd forms at the entrance to Charlie's. Haven 
               walks slowly forward until he reaches the waiting sheriff. 
               He looks him over with a smile of contempt.

                                     SHERIFF
                         You're under arrest!

                              (pausing)
                         For what?

                                     SHERIFF
                         For the murder of James Goddard -- 
                         and robbery under arms!

                                     HAVEN
                              (casually)
                         I've heard about you. You don't appear 
                         to understand the functions of your 
                         office.
                              (taking sheriff's gun 
                              and breaking it open)
                         You've missed the whole point of 
                         your profession.
                              (showing him)
                         Even your gun isn't loaded.
                              (Haven loads it as it 
                              goes on)
                         I suggest that you start all over 
                         again, with this point in mind: the 
                         duty of a peace officer is to arrest 
                         the culprit of a crime -- not the 
                         victim.

               Haven hands him back the now loaded gun and walks away towards 
               the saloon, leaving the sheriff standing there, a completely 
               dumbfounded and bepuzzled man.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - NIGHT

               The place is roaring. Haven enters, followed by Mark. The 
               guy at the piano is playing as always. Haven and Mark go 
               slowly to the bar, eyes following them. The noise softens 
               almost to silence, except the piano, Cowering, Mark sticks 
               close to Haven.

               At the dice table, Prince stares coldly, hands another man 
               the stick and walks away to the stairway, his eyes seeking 
               Mick Marion who is also staring at Haven. Prince nods to 
               Mick as he goes.

               MED. SHOT at bar -- as Haven and Mark loan against it. Ernie 
               is looking at him curiously; then towards Mick. Haven doesn't 
               follow the glance, but Mark does.

                                     ERNIE
                         Rye?

                         Two.

               Ernie gets them. Haven glances at the piano. Mick who had 
               stood there has now vanished. Haven smiles. The drinks arrive.

                                     BRISTOW
                              (gulping his drink)
                         This is no good.

                         The bourbon is just as bad.

                                     BRISTOW
                         I don't mean that.

                         I just don't like it.

                         I'm a nervous man. Something's going 
                         to happen. I can feel it.

                         Then why don't we do something.

                         We're doing something.

                         What?

                              (smiling at Mark)

               Mark finishes off his second. A stickman comes up. Nudges 
               Haven.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Charlie wants to see you. Upstairs.

                              (to Mark)
                         See?

               The stickman moves away. Mark looks at Haven.

                                     BRISTOW
                         Do I go with you?

                                     HAVEN
                         Can you make it?

               Haven turns away towards the stairs. Mark hesitates, bites 
               his lip, swallows another drink and then grimly follows.

               INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Charlie is behind her desk, as Haven walks in. Behind him, 
               sweating now, comes Mark. As the two are in the room the 
               door behind them slams shut. Mick is there with a gun. Prince 
               moves slightly out of a shadow. Mark backs against a wall. 
               Charlie looks up from her fingernails. Haven smiles and 
               glances around. His eyes fix on Mick and the gun.

                         I see you found the difference.

               Mick says nothing, his face a blank hatred. Haven sits down 
               in a big chair.

                                     HAVEN
                         Looks like a board meeting.

               Another door opens and Pete, the sawmill foreman, enters, 
               stands silently. Haven glances at him, then at Charlie who 
               smiles thinly back.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (indicating Mark)
                         What's he doing with you?

                                     HAVEN
                         I thought I might need a lawyer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I doubt it.

                                     HAVEN
                         I can realize how seldom legal 
                         technicalities annoy you -- but I 
                         have one that might.
                              (taking out his pipe)
                         Besides, he knows all about it.

                                     PRINCE
                         About what?

                                     HAVEN
                         About a gear box I failed to deliver.

                                     BRISTOW
                         I don't know anything! I merely --

                                     PRINCE
                         Shut up!

               Mark relapses into a perspiring silence.

                                     HAVEN
                              (quietly)
                         Mark is right. He doesn't know 
                         anything. He just knows what I 
                         dictated to him in a deposition.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And what was that?

                                     HAVEN
                         It was just a story. About a man who 
                         got murdered, a thief who got shot, 
                         and a gear box that got lost. Probably 
                         nobody would believe it --
                              (glancing up)
                         ...unless I got killed for it.

               Charlie stares at him a moment. Then she glances at Pete.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Go downstairs, Pete. Watch the 
                         stairway.

               Pete walks out.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to Haven)
                         Who else have you told?

                                     HAVEN
                         No one. Mark I had to have. He's a 
                         witness and a notary. He makes it 
                         stick. He stands it up in court.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (always watching his 
                              face)
                         What keeps it from getting to a court?

                         A cut.

                         He's running a bluff!

                         I ran one on you.

               Mick burns in silence. Charlie smiles.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You brought your lawyer. Ask him if 
                         this doesn't sound like blackmail.

                                     HAVEN
                         He can't think very clearly in the 
                         presence of a gun.

                                     PRINCE
                         But it doesn't bother you?

                              (coldly)
                         No, it doesn't.

                                     PRINCE
                         What you want is money.

               Haven nods.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I don't see how going to the law 
                         will get it for you.

                                     HAVEN
                         If you did see how, I'd never get 
                         there, would I?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm afraid not.

                                     HAVEN
                         So it boils down to this: we can 
                         make a deal, and all be happy 
                         together.

                                     PRINCE
                         Not as long as you always have 
                         something on us.

                         Unless you also have something on 
                         me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And how would that be?

                         When I deliver the gold to you.

                         You mean the gear box?

                                     HAVEN
                         I can even forget I looked inside. 
                         So I stole a gear box... I'm still a 
                         thief.

               Charlie is silent a moment. Haven lights his pipe. Charlie 
               looks at Mark, pale by the wall.

                                     PRINCE
                              (indicating Mark)
                         What does he get?

                                     HAVEN
                         He gets even with you.

                         Have you lost your mind!

                         It was all right when he lost his 
                         money.

                                     CHARLIE
                         All right... I'll give him the 
                         IOU's... when the gear box is 
                         delivered.

                              (smiling)
                         You don't realize how important it 
                         is when a piece of machinery breaks 
                         down. It could close the entire 
                         sawmill.

                                     HAVEN
                         I guess I didn't realize it.

               She looks coolly at Mick and Mark.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I think that's all.

               Mark glances at Haven who nods and Mark leaves in the wake 
               of the grimly departing Mick. Prince lingers.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to Haven)
                         You can stay.

                              (to Prince)
                         I think she was talking to me.

               Prince gets up grimly, his lips tight, the dice held hard in 
               his fingers. He stares at Haven.

                                     PRINCE
                         You roll nice dice and you bet them 
                         jamb up, but some day you'll slip. 
                         And when you do, I'll be around to 
                         catch you.

               He turns and walks out. Haven watches him go.

                                     HAVEN
                         You know, I think he will.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Then you should be more careful.

                                     HAVEN
                         The poorhouses are filled with careful

                         ...And so are the graveyards.

               Charlie comes around and sits on the arm of his chair.

                                     HAVEN
                         You've got a nice perfume.

                         I almost had to have you killed. I'd

                         So would I.

                         I'd have missed you... too much.

                         And too long.

               She brushes his cheek with her lips.

                         I was always in the doorway when I 
                         said it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You never said it to me.

                         Let's go over to the doorway.

               He rises and so does she. She picks up a scarf in silence 
               and anger, crosses and goes out the door, Haven following 
               her.

               INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT

               As Haven and Charlie descend. Her face is hard.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I seem to always end up like this 
                         with you. I take you for granted. 
                         You like it that way. It goes with 
                         loaded dice and crimped cards and 
                         fixed wheels.

                                     HAVEN
                         Isn't that your business.

                         It isn't my life.

               As they descend, Stellman can be seen in the bar crowd, 
               watching them.

               MED. SHOT of Charlie and Haven at foot of stairs. Haven is 
               smiling at her, but her face is serious and her eyes hard.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You told me once you might be a

                         that's as much as I've ever found 
                         out about you. You're working for 
                         me, but for all I know you could be 
                         working for somebody else.

                         Like Goddard?

                         Why not?

               Haven smiles. He can see Stellman approaching.

                                     HAVEN
                         I think I better bring you that gold.

               He starts away, but Stellman halts him.

                         Haven.

               Haven looks at him. Charlie watches.

                         Don't tell me you're still recruiting?

                         Yes, we still want you. But this is 
                         a little different.

                                     STELLMAN
                         Captain Iles has asked me to take 
                         you into custody, Haven.

               Haven stares at him, then looks at Charlie. A slow smile 
               dawns on her face.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (quietly)
                         You heard the man.

                                     STELLMAN
                         Best thing for you is to come along, 
                         Haven.

                         That's what I like -- the best thing 
                         for me.

               He pats Charlie's shoulder and then walks out with Stellman. 
               Charlie watches them go. Prince appears beside her.

                                     PRINCE
                         Very friendly with everybody -- isn't 
                         he? Wells Fargo detectives, and now 
                         the Army. How far can he go?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Exactly where he's headed now -- to 
                         jail.

               She walks away towards the piano. Prince stands there, 
               watching Haven go.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. ILES' OFFICE - NIGHT

               There is a sergeant inside facing Iles who sits behind his 
               desk. Stellman and Haven pause at the door.

                                     SERGEANT
                              (to Iles)
                         The Quartermaster at Platte wants 
                         three sworn statements before he'll 
                         replace those seventy uniforms, sir.

                                     ILES
                         Three sworn statements! I told him 
                         all I know. They were in the freight 
                         office at West Rim City. The building 
                         burned down.. .you sure he doesn't 
                         want me to send him the ashes too?
                              (seeing Stellman)
                         All right, have Stamm fix the papers.

               The Sergeant exits. Iles looks calmly and with relish at 
               Haven.

                                     ILES
                              (pleasantly)
                         Come in.

               Haven and Stellman enter. Stellman closes the door and stands 
               near it. Haven smiles and nods at Iles, then sits down 
               unbidden.

                                     ILES
                         Nice to see you alive.

                         Curiously enough, you got me into 
                         the habit of reading myself. You're 
                         quite right about The Blue Book --

                         Right here in your own statement!

               Haven glances at him, then at the statement, and then tosses 
               it on the desk and inhales.

                         to save somebody's gold. That's a 
                         mistake you made. I still don't know 
                         who killed them, but I'm going to 
                         find out. And when the net is hauled 
                         in, they're all going to be in it.

               They look hard at each other in silence.

                         don't expect any help from me. Is

               Haven turns and walks out; the door closes behind him. Iles 
               slumps down into his chair. Stellman is smiling faintly at 
               him.

               FADE IN

               EXT. COUNTRY - DAY

               Haven, driving a wagon and team of horses, is retracing the 
               road he took back from the sawmill looking for the place 
               where he dumped the bullion.

               CLOSER VIEW of Haven, as he looks for the landmarks. He is 
               whistling softly the tune that Charlie always sings. At last 
               he stops, alights and makes his way down the steep slope, a 
               couple of gunny sacks slung across his shoulder.

               Bottom of the gulley as Haven gets there and locates the 
               crate at rest in a clump of brush. The crate has broken from 
               the fall. Haven loads the buckskin bags of gold into the 
               gunny sack and scrambles back up the slope.

               Side of slope as Haven scrambles to the top, he finds himself 
               looking into a six-shooter held in the unwavering hand of 
               Mrs. Caslon. Her eyes are hard and a grim smile plays at the 
               corners of her mouth.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         Drop it.

               Haven obeys.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         Turn around with your hands up.

               Haven turns. She takes his gun and tosses it in the wagon; 
               then glances inside the sack, sees the gold. She backs off a 
               step or two.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         All right -- put it in the wagon.

               Haven turns to obey. He manages a smile at her.

                                     HAVEN
                         Is this a hold-up?

                         You want to put it in the wagon?

                              eyes)
                         Yes.

               He struggles with the sack, swings it onto the wagon in which 
               he came. Then stands back, looking at her.

                         in their club. This was the initiation 
                         fee.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         Fifty thousand dollars?

                                     HAVEN
                         Well, you see, I thought it was worth 
                         it.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         Well, you see, I don't.

               She climbs to the seat of the wagon watching him warily. 
               Haven doesn't move.

                                     HAVEN
                              (quietly)
                         What you're doing may get me into 
                         serious trouble.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         If you're still in town in twenty-
                         four hours, I promise what I do may 
                         get you hanged.

               She grabs the rein of her own horse, flicks the reins of the 
               wagon team and rides away, leaving Haven on the road, 
               horseless and very much discountenanced. He watches grimly 
               as she rides away. At a distance from him she tosses his gun 
               beside the road.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. CHARLIE'S SALOON - DAY

               As Haven enters. He is dusty and tired from his long walk. 
               The place is moderately busy.

               MED. SHOT of Haven as he sits tiredly at a table where Charlie 
               and Prince are sitting. She smiles at him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I thought you were in jail.

                                     HAVEN
                         I talked my way out.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're a very glib man. You seem to 
                         talk your way out of everything.

                                     HAVEN
                         Up to a certain point.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What's that?

                                     HAVEN
                         A gun.
                              (to the waiter)
                         Champagne.

               The waiter exits. Charlie looks at Haven curiously.

                                     PRINCE
                         Are we celebrating something?

                                     HAVEN
                              (to Charlie)
                         You know, the first time I talked to 
                         you we had champagne.
                              (smiling at her)
                         I think I should have been a 
                         missionary and gone to China after 
                         all.

               He takes out the pipe, twirls it in his fingers. The waiter 
               puts down the champagne. Charlie is looking at Haven with 
               puzzlement and curiosity. The waiter goes...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Didn't you bring me something?

                                     HAVEN
                         No.

                                     CHARLIE
                         But you will?

                                     HAVEN
                         No.

               Her face changes; hardens. She glances across at Prince. 
               Haven watches Prince with a smile.

                                     PRINCE
                              (quietly)
                         No -- just like that?

                                     HAVEN
                         It's easy to explain. It's just a 
                         little hard to believe.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Make it as credible as you can.

                                     HAVEN
                              (smiling grimly)
                         I can't.
                              (filling the pipe)
                         I went to get it, and it was there. 
                         But so was somebody else.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Who?

                                     HAVEN
                         Mrs. Caslon.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Alone?

                                     HAVEN
                         No... she had a gun with her.

                                     PRINCE
                         Did you have one too?

                                     HAVEN
                         The one she had was in her hand.

               There is a silence. Prince stares idly at the dice cubes in 
               his hand. Charlie stares straight at Haven. Haven glances at 
               Prince.

                                     HAVEN
                         This could be that slip you mentioned.

               Prince just stares at him.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to Haven)
                         So this nice lady held you up and 
                         took the gold, is that it?

                                     HAVEN
                         It's like saying I got robbed at 
                         Sunday school. It's no good, is it?

                                     PRINCE
                              (looking at him)
                         No, it isn't.

                                     HAVEN
                         I even had to walk back to town. I 
                         think that may be one of the longest 
                         walks I ever took.

                                     PRINCE
                         And one of the last.

               Haven takes a sip of the champagne, Charlie's whole manner 
               has now changed. It is cold and very quiet.

                                     PRINCE
                         Mick might have killed you, but you 
                         fought him with your fists. The 
                         sheriff had a gun but you took it 
                         away from him. Ben had a gun last 
                         night but it didn't seem to scare 
                         you. Now this genteol petticoat waves 
                         a pistol and you run for your life.

                                     HAVEN
                              (twirling the 
                              wineglass, glancing 
                              at Charlie)
                         He makes it sound very silly.

                                     PRINCE
                         Or I make it sound like what it is: 
                         a lie!
                              (he rises)

               Haven reaches in his pocket for a match. Prince, mistaking 
               the gesture, swiftly extracts a small pistol from his belt, 
               covers him.

                                     PRINCE
                         No.

               Haven extracts the match, with a glance of contempt at Prince; 
               then lights the pipe again.

                                     HAVEN
                              (smiling faintly)
                         My word doesn't seem very good around 
                         here.

                                     PRINCE
                         You've only got one thing left that's 
                         any good here - and that's some gold.

                                     HAVEN
                              (to Charlie)
                         Is that all I've got?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not quite. You've got some time. 
                         You've got two hours to get it here.

               There is a brief silence that punctuates this statement. It 
               has an air of fatal finality, marked by the idle MUSIC of 
               the deaf pianist. Haven puts his pipe away, carefully so 
               that Prince won't get any mistaken ideas.

                                     HAVEN
                         You want me to fatten you up before 
                         you kill me? Is that what you mean?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I said what I meant -- two hours.

               Haven rises. He brushes some dust off his coat, smiles thinly 
               at Charlie.

                                     HAVEN
                         I once knew a guy who stole a dime 
                         tip from a lunch counter and parlayed 
                         it into fifty thousand. I might try 
                         that -- but not in two hours.

               She says nothing; her face carved out of ice. Prince smiles 
               thinly. Haven looks at him, shrugs. He hesitates; then pats 
               Charlie's frigid shoulder.

                                     HAVEN
                              (to Charlie)
                         You're sweet.

               He turns and walks slowly out. The dirge of the piano follows 
               him. Prince fingers his pistol a little, tempted. At a look 
               from Charlie he puts it away. Haven goes out. Charlie suddenly 
               leaves the tables and goes quickly up the stairs. Prince 
               watches her with a slow smile, picks up Haven's gun and 
               pockets it...

                                                                       WIPE

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               As Haven leaves the saloon. He pauses, looks around, up at 
               the sky, then down the street. He takes out his pipe and 
               beginning filling it slowly with tobacco, as Mark Bristow 
               comes hurrying across the street.

               MOVING SHOT of Haven as he walks very slowly, filling the 
               pipe, and Mark comes alongside and walks with him. Haven 
               hardly glances at him.

                                     BRISTOW
                         I've been looking for you. Where 
                         have you been?

                                     HAVEN
                         I took a walk in the country.

                                     BRISTOW
                         Did you get it for her?

                                     HAVEN
                         No.
                              (pausing in front of 
                              the hotel)
                         Sorry.

               MED. SHOT of Haven and Mark outside the hotel. Mark is afraid 
               and puzzled. He keeps staring at Haven's face.

                                     BRISTOW
                         But that was the deal. You agreed to --

               He pauses as two men walk by.

                                     BRISTOW
                         If you're trying to pull something --

                                     HAVEN
                              (finished with the 
                              pipe)
                         You want to listen?

                                     BRISTOW
                              (calming himself)
                         All right.

                                     HAVEN
                              (explicitly)
                         I can't deliver it because I no longer 
                         have it. It was taken away from me 
                         by Mrs. Caslon. I've told Charlie, 
                         and she's very unhappy. I have two 
                         hours to produce the loot. You haven't 
                         any idea where a man could raise 
                         fifty thousand quickly, have you?

               Mark's mouth pops open.

                                     HAVEN
                         I thought not.

               Haven lights the pipe. Mark stands there, mouth open; fear 
               draining the blood from his face. His voice is a mere whisper.

                                     BRISTOW
                         What are you going to do...?

                                     HAVEN
                         Nothing, Mark. The boat just sailed.

                                     BRISTOW
                         What about me?

                                     HAVEN
                         You'll have to think of something 
                         very good.

               Mark stares at him, then looks off. His face becomes grim. 
               He almost glares back at Haven.

                                     BRISTOW
                         I can think of something.

                                     HAVEN
                              (patting his shoulder 
                              with a slight smile)
                         Go ahead, Mark. Go ahead and do it.

               Mark stares at him, then turns abruptly away. He hurries 
               across the street. Haven watches him as he goes off in the 
               direction of Mrs. Caslon. Haven smiles and walks inside the 
               hotel.

                                                                       WIPE

               INT. HAVEN'S ROOM - DAY

               He enters, locks the door. Pulls the shade at the window, 
               takes off his shoes and coat and lies down on the bed. He 
               gazes towards the wall, thoughtfully. He gets up, goes to 
               the window, opens it softly; then looks out. Down the alley, 
               at the corner, a man is lounging; an ugly looking character, 
               whose eyes watch the alleyway. Haven smiles wryly, goes back 
               to the bed and lies down. The piano music starts next door.

               INT. UPPER HALLWAY - SALOON

               As Pete knocks on Charlie's office door, then enters.

               INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAY

               As Pete enters. He looks around. Mick is sitting there and 
               Prince. Charlie is standing at the window. By another door 
               another grim character stands in silence. Charlie turns as 
               Peter enters.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Everything ready?

                                     PETE
                         All set.

                         Got enough men at the sawmill?

                         Plenty.

                                     PRINCE
                         All right. Go back out there and get 
                         them into the uniforms. We'll hit 
                         the post just before midnight.

               Pete turns and walks out, shutting the door behind him. There 
               is silence. Charlie looks out the window again. Prince fools 
               with the dice. Mick stands stolidly near the door. At last 
               the silence is broken over the ticking of the wall clock.

                                     PRINCE
                         I don't know what we're waiting for.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I gave him some time. He's in the 
                         hotel. He's not doing anything. I 
                         gave him some time. I don't care 
                         what he does with it.

               She has not turned from the window. The clock ticks. From 
               behind her Mick's voice comes, quiet and deadly.

                                     MICK
                         And I don't care when, but I'll get 
                         him.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Again?

               Mick is silent. Charlie smiles thinly.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               As Mark hurries into the saloon, a desperate look on his 
               face.

               INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAY

               As Charlie turns from the window.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Bristow's here.

                                     PRINCE
                         This should be good.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to Mick)
                         Let him in.

               Mick goes to the door, opens it; just as Mark arrives a little 
               breathlessly at the door. Mark enters, a little surprised at 
               the door opening for him, glancing back as Mick quietly shuts 
               it. Charlie looks coldly at the lawyer who is sweating again. 
               Mark stands there, silent a moment, gathering himself 
               together.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You want the I.O.U's?

                                     BRISTOW
                         You mean --

               She has turned to the safe; now she turns with them and as 
               Mark reaches for them, Charlie drops them at his feet. They 
               scatter. He bends to pick them up. Prince smiles at him 
               contemptuously. Mark is picking them up one at a time when 
               suddenly he pauses, stands erect, and looks at them with 
               fear and suspicion.

                                     BRISTOW
                         Why? Did Haven --

                                     PRINCE
                         No, he didn't.

                                     BRISTOW
                         Then I don't understand --

                                     PRINCE
                         We don't think they're going to be 
                         any good.

               Mark stands there. The papers slip from his fingers. He knows 
               what Prince means. But his mouth hardens in an effort.

                                     BRISTOW
                         I didn't have anything to do with 
                         it. All I did was write it. I'm not 
                         in on this. I can still make them 
                         good.
                              (he puts a couple 
                              back on the desk)
                         Or I can --

                                     CHARLIE
                         What?

                                     BRISTOW
                         I can do business.
                              (fumbling in his pocket)
                         I got it somewhere. I -- Here -- 
                         take a look at this -- the deposition --
                              (bringing out the 
                              deposition)
                         The only copy.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (coldly)
                         Let's have it.

                                     BRISTOW
                              (eagerly)
                         Here.

               Hands it to her.

                                     PRINCE
                         What do you want?

                                     BRISTOW
                              (as Charlie opens the 
                              envelope)
                         Nothing. I just want to get out of 
                         it. I never had any part of it. This 
                         ought to prove that!

                                     CHARLIE
                         This?

               She hands him the paper from the envelope. Marks takes it 
               and stares at it. It is absolutely a blank piece of paper. 
               He stands there, bites his lips. He looks wearily around at 
               them, fear making him weak, making him unable to hold the 
               piece of paper, so that it floats to the carpet.

                                     BRISTOW
                              (at last)
                         It's -- it's a trick. I --
                              (trying to pull himself 
                              together)
                         I'll see about this! He can't do 
                         this to me!
                              (moving back towards 
                              the door)
                         I'll go and see about this!

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sure, you see about it.

               He stops dead in his tracks as Charlie moves towards him 
               with a little pistol, pearl-handled. But she only gives it 
               to him. She has to take his hand and put it in his palm.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Take this along.

               He backs out, the little gun in his hand. Mick opens the 
               door. In sudden relief and haste Mark barrels out. They can 
               hear his quick feet on the stairs outside. Prince looks at 
               Charlie.

                                     PRINCE
                         Something left to wait for?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (slowly)
                         No.

               Prince gets up and leaves, and Mick, with a grim smile of 
               anticipation follows. Charlie sits slowly down in the chair. 
               The music comes up the stairs and through the door.

               INT. HAVEN'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Haven is lying on the bed, his arms under his head, his eyes 
               on the ceiling. There is a SOUND in the hallway and then a 
               hurried knock at the door. Haven slowly rises, walks to the 
               door. He stands there. The knock SOUNDS again.

                                     HAVEN
                         Who is it?

                                     MARK'S VOICE
                         It's me -- Bristow -- let me in.

               Haven opens the door. Mark enters swiftly, the little gun in 
               his hand. Haven shuts the door and locks it. He turns and 
               faces Mark, now pointing the gun. Without a word Haven walks 
               over to the bed and lies down again, looking at the ceiling. 
               Mark follows him with the gun.

                                     HAVEN
                         You going to shoot me, Mark?

                                     BRISTOW
                         You double crossed me, Haven.

                                     HAVEN
                         I did?

                                     BRISTOW
                         I got the deposition back. I took it 
                         to them.

               Haven leans on one elbow, looking at him.

                                     BRISTOW
                         It wasn't there! It was a piece of 
                         blank paper!

               Haven lies back with a short laugh. Mark stares at him in 
               fury.

                                     BRISTOW
                         Don't you laugh at me! I ought to 
                         kill you!

                                     HAVEN
                         They want you to, Mark.

               Haven again leans on one elbow, looking at Mark and the 
               trembling hand that holds the gun.

                                     HAVEN
                         And it may be your only out, if you 
                         do. But I doubt it. You know why? 
                         Because even if you took them my 
                         scalp, it wouldn't buy your life. 
                         You're in debt and you're broke and 
                         you're scared -- and you know far 
                         too much. There isn't any way they 
                         use you -- alive. Can you think of 
                         one?

               Mark sits slowly back in the chair, beaten.

                                     BRISTOW
                         They're going to do it. I know it. 
                         They're going to kill me --
                              (his hand trembles)
                         Why do they have to kill me?

                                     HAVEN
                         Us, Mark...

               Haven gets up slowly, reaches over and takes the little gun, 
               smiles at it.

                                     HAVEN
                         This must be hers.

                                     BRISTOW
                              (dully)
                         Yes.

                                     HAVEN
                         She's sweet.

               He puts the gun on the table. Mark's teeth are chattering. 
               He is almost ready to cry. Haven gets a bottle and pours him 
               a drink in a dusty glass. He hands it to Mark.

                                     HAVEN
                         There's one thing, Mark.

                                     BRISTOW

               Mark gets up waveringly. Takes another hooker.

                         very little time to keep it. You do 
                         it very fast and you might be lucky.

                         Yes. I might be. I'll try it.

               Mark hurries out into the hall. Goes. Haven turns back and 
               looks at the room, picks up the little pistol, smiles at it. 
               Shrugs and then slips into his coat and exits, too.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

               As Haven enters. SHOOTING FROM his ANGLE, we can see, as he 
               does, Mark crossing the street, apparently towards his law 
               office. He is in such a hurry that he falls down, crawls a 
               little, gets up, runs. Just as he reaches the office door, 
               just as his hand touches the knob, a shot rings out and he 
               crumples. He still tries, then his hand slips from the knob 
               and he lies there dead. The vacant street is empty with his 
               death. Haven stares. He takes a match from the counter, 
               applies it to his pipe -- then finding the pipe empty, smiles 
               thinly and pockets it

               He takes the little pistol from his pocket and glances at 
               it. The clerk, watching, idly strumming the guitar string.

               Haven smiles. He feels in his pocket, comes out with the 
               army button gotten at the sawmill.

                                     HAVEN

                              idea hits him)
                         Yeh? A very good question.

               The clerk stares at him; Haven smiles grimly. He breaks the 
               little gun, checks it.

                                     HAVEN
                         I might even know. I think I'll try 
                         to go and find out.

               He starts to the door, the little gun in hand; very slowly. 
               Watching him, the clerk twangs the strings softly. Haven 
               walks very slowly. He opens the door and hesitates. Just as 
               he is about to step out, looking up and down the street, 
               there is a furor and the sheriff rides up outside and 
               dismounts. Starts over to inspect Mark's body. He turns as 
               Haven walks on to the street, hands held high.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               As Haven emerges and the Sheriff holds a gun on him.

               ANGLE on Mick as down the street, with disgust, he lowers 
               his gun.

               ANGLE on Prince as from a doorway he watches. Stopping with 
               a shake of his head the intent of a man beside him to shoot.

               FULL SHOT -- street -- as Haven surrenders to the sheriff.

                                     SHERIFF
                         All right, you -- march.

               Haven obeys, walking up the street -- the sheriff and the 
               sheriff's horse behind him. People watch, appearing now in 
               safety. The sheriff is pretty pleased.

               MOVING SHOT -- of Haven and Sheriff. As they go, Haven's 
               hands still aloft.

                                     HAVEN
                         You loaded your gun for this?

                                     SHERIFF
                         No -- you did.

               Back of them can now be seen the figures of Mick and Prince 
               and the other gunman, following at a little distance. Going 
               leisurely, now Haven slows his pace so that the sheriff is 
               closer behind him.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Come on, you! Keep moving!

               Haven suddenly drops to his knees. The sheriff almost walks 
               over him. The sheriff stumbles with an oath. Haven grapples 
               with him. Haven snatches his gun, drags him by a headlock to 
               the horse, flings him aside and then mounts. A second later 
               he is away. Shots RING OUT as Mick and Prince and the gunman 
               shoot. Haven rides on, bent low, out of town. The sheriff 
               hides his bulk in the dust as the bullets fly.

               ANGLE from Charlie's office -- as she goes to the window, 
               stares out at the flying form of Haven. A slow smile comes 
               over her face, bitter and grim, yet somehow faintly 
               admiring... She sees Mick mount a horse and start after Haven. 
               Then she turns abruptly away.

                                                                       WIPE

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

               As Haven slows down his horse, but goes on at a fair clip 
               after looking warily back. He breaks open the sheriff's gun, 
               finds it loaded. He reacts and whistles softly. As he swings 
               his horse off the travelled road to head crosscountry for 
               the sawmill.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN

               EXT. NEAR SAWMILL - NIGHT

               As Haven sits on his horse at a point in the woods where he 
               can look down on the sawmill. Around the mill office there 
               seems to be signs of unusual activity. Haven sees Mick Marion 
               going by on the road towards the mill. Mick passes not far 
               away and is riding hard. Haven watches as Mick arrives and 
               Pete can be seen in conference with him. Other men -- too 
               many -- are gathered around. At last Haven dismounts and 
               makes his way carefully on foot towards the warehouse.

               EXT. WOODS IN BACK OF WAREHOUSE

               As Haven leaves his horse in the brush and trees and then 
               approaches the building. He finds a window in back, breaks 
               it with a stone; then waits tensely to see if the sound has 
               attracted any attention, gun in hand now. It doesn't. Haven 
               replaces the gun in his holster, opens the window and crawls 
               inside.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Haven surveys the piles of crates, boxes and equipment. He 
               starts his search methodically and swiftly. Suddenly a shaft 
               of light comes from the front doors opened now by two men. 
               Haven shrinks back, drawing his gun. The men start to enter 
               when Pete's voice is heard.

                                     PETE'S VOICE
                         Where you guys goin'?

                                     MAN
                         You want them uniforms out, don't 
                         you?

                                     PETE'S VOICE
                         I'll tell you when.

               The men turn and leave. Haven relaxes. He goes back to work, 
               pulls back a big canvas tarpaulin one of the men had 
               approached, and there before him is revealed the army 
               uniforms, stacked in neat piles. He looks and smiles grimly. 
               Outside is the SOUND of horses and more men arriving. Haven 
               goes slowly around the warehouse now, looking for something. 
               At last he finds it: a can of kerosene. He takes it over to 
               the uniforms, pours it liberally on them. At just this moment 
               a figure appears at the door.

                                     MAN
                         What you think you're doin'?

               Haven lights a match and tosses it on the soaked bales of 
               uniforms. They blaze up instantly. The man shoots as Haven 
               ducks away.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               As the shot RINGS out. Pete and Mick, surrounded by many 
               men, turn swiftly. Flame and smoke emerge from the warehouse. 
               They start swiftly across, drawing guns. The man at the door 
               shoots again into the smoking interior. An answering SHOT 
               from Haven fells him.

               INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               As Haven makes his way back to the open window. He crawls 
               out swiftly. Now the building is in flames. He can hear 
               shouting and, as he moves away, the useless attempt of men 
               to put out the blaze, working with buckets of water.

               EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               As Haven starts for the woods. The flames now light the ground 
               around, and Pete appears around the side of the building. 
               Pete fires and Haven draws and shoots. Pete whirls away, hit 
               but still on his feet, driving forward, trying to shoot again 
               and this time Haven drills him clean and Pete goes down to 
               stay. Other men come up as Haven makes for the woods, 
               disappears.

               Mick Marion and a dozen men appear, shooting. Mick suddenly 
               changes his mind, turns past the body of Pete, gets his horse 
               and heads back to town full tilt.

               INT. WOODS - NIGHT

               As Haven watches the flaming building. The slowly approaching 
               figures of the men are illumined in the big light of the 
               fire. Haven smiles, turns to the horse and moves slowly 
               through the trees to a place where he can mount; then mounts 
               and rides for it, SHOTS following him as he breaks into the 
               clear some hundred yards away and heads for the road that 
               Mick Marion took back to town. Bent low, Haven rides for his 
               life -- and makes it...

                                                                   FADE OUT

               EXT. ARMY POST - DAWN

               As Haven rides up, a detachment of men supervised by Stellman 
               is forming beside mounts in the parade ground. Haven dismounts 
               and starts inside. He glances at his wagon parked outside. 
               It is the one Mrs. Caslon took from him. He smiles slightly 
               as he notes it.

               INT. ARMY POST - ILES' OFFICES - DAWN

               Haven walks in, brushes past the desk sergeant with a cursory 
               nod and enters Iles' sanctum.

               INT. ILES' OFFICE - DAWN

               As Haven enters. Mrs. Caslon is there, and Iles, in full 
               field uniform. They look at him quickly as he enters; he 
               pauses, glances at Mrs. Caslon and then faces the explosive 
               Iles.

                                     ILES

               As Iles stares, dumbfounded, at this impertinence:

                                     HAVEN
                         You lost some uniforms? You thought 
                         they were burned?

                                     ILES
                         They were.

                         No, they weren't, but they are now 
                         because I just set fire to them.

                                     ILES
                              (rising)
                         What's this?

                                     HAVEN
                         They're smouldering right now in the 
                         warehouse at the sawmill, and there 
                         are about seventy men down there who 
                         were ready to wear them.

                                     ILES
                         Wear them? What for?

                                     HAVEN
                         What other reason? To get in the 
                         post and take the gold from you.

               Iles gawks at him.

                                     HAVEN
                         You were taking a detachment up north 
                         on an Indian scare?

               Iles nods vaguely.

                                     HAVEN
                         Well, that scare is a fake. A ruse. 
                         So you know where to send them now.

                                     ILES
                         Look here, Lieutenant --

                                     HAVEN
                         Correction.

               Haven dips into a lining pocket under his arm and tosses a 
               paper at Iles. Iles glances at it, then looks, thunderstruck, 
               at Haven.

                                     ILES
                         Major?

                                     HAVEN
                         You better get down to that sawmill, 
                         Captain. They may try it anyway.

               ILES' expression slowly changes. He smiles at last.

                                     ILES
                         I guess I owe you an apology.

                                     HAVEN
                              (extending his hand)
                         I'll take it.

               He shakes hands with Iles for second, then Iles goes out 
               abruptly. Outside we can hear abrupt commands to the Sergeant 
               before the door closes. Haven takes out his pipe, looks at 
               the silent, dumb-struck Mrs Caslon. He smiles at her slightly. 
               She gets her voice at last.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         I guess I owe you something too.

                         Only fifty thousand.

               Outside "To Horse" is sounding. Haven glances out the window, 
               hardly aware of Mrs Caslon's presence.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         I wish there was something I could 
                         say or do.

                                     HAVEN
                         There is. You can give me back my 
                         gun.

               She goes to the desk, gets it and hands it to him. He takes 
               the gun from his holster and hands it to her.

                                     HAVEN
                         And you can give this one back to 
                         the sheriff.

               She takes it.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                         I'll always remember what a fool I 
                         made of myself.

                                     HAVEN

                         I always try to forget.

               He puts his own gun in holster. Glances out the window.

                                     MRS. CASLON
                              (watching his face)
                         Are you going too?

                                     HAVEN
                         Not with them...

               He pats her shoulder in a gesture of goodbye and walks out 
               the door. She stands watching him, then moves to the window 
               and looks out.

               EXT. POST - DAWN

               As Haven walks outside towards his waiting horse. He pauses, 
               pipe in mouth, lighting the pipe now, his face intensely 
               interested as he watches the men form on the parade ground 
               in front of the mounted Iles and Stellman.

               FULL SHOT of soldiers. As they mount to a brisk command, and 
               the color bearer takes position. Iles barks out a command; 
               the column forms into marching order. On the double quick, 
               the cavalry company starts out and on the way.

               CLOSE SHOT of Haven as he watches; his eyes lighting a little, 
               the pipe in hand. We feel that he'd like to go too in this 
               moment.

               ANOTHER ANGLE from Haven's view, as the column of cavalry 
               departs. Haven waves his hand, a half salute, a half gesture 
               to Iles as Iles salutes him in passing. Then only the dust 
               remains and Haven's gaze lingers. His face changes. It becomes 
               grim. He slowly knocks the ashes from the pipe, pockets it. 
               He slowly mounts the horse. He takes out his gun and checks 
               it. Then slowly he rides away, like a man on a mission he 
               dislikes but cannot evade.

               INT. ILES OFFICE - DAWN

               As Mrs. Caslon looks out the window. Her face, tense, as she 
               watches the lonely figure go; her hand waves slightly.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN

               Charlie is standing by the desk and window. Prince is sitting 
               there, talking, the inevitable dice in his fingers.

                                     PRINCE
                         There's seventy men ready for any 
                         kind of play. I say we can still 
                         swing it -- and get out of town.

               THERE is SOUND of massed horses outside and Charlie looks 
               out. Prince walks to the window. They look in silence.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Can we?

               EXT. STREET - DAWN

               As Iles rides by at full gallop, followed by a troop of 
               cavalry, headed for the sawmill.

               INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN

               As they watch. Prince turns away.

                                     PRINCE
                         You wanted to give Haven time. Well, 
                         he took it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You better get out before he takes 
                         you.

                                     PRINCE
                         By that I presume you intend to 
                         remain.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (wistfully)
                         I've been here as long as I remember.

               Prince crosses to the window and stands looking at Charlie.

                                     PRINCE
                         I asked you once if Haven moved me 
                         out.
                              (he smiles)
                         I think he's moved us both out -- 
                         together.

               Charlie looks at him but does not answer and then she turns 
               to the window, and smiles slightly. Prince follows her gaze 
               to the street. His face is grim.

               EXT. STREET - DAWN

               Haven, mounted, is coming up the street. Slowly and carefully 
               he progresses to the front of the saloon.

               INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN

               As Charlie glances at Prince.

                                     PRINCE
                              (softly)
                         This is the way I wanted it... and 
                         when I've finished you will too... 
                         as though Haven had never been here.

               He turns and goes quietly and swiftly from the room. Charlie 
               stands thoughtfully. There is nothing in her look or manner 
               to indicate that what Prince has said has made the slightest 
               impression on her.

               EXT. STREET - DAWN

               As Haven comes up to the saloon door.

               INT. SALOON DAWN

               As Prince moves into a shadowy corner.

               ANGLE ON the door as Haven enters and looks around. He sees 
               no one. The place seems utterly deserted. It is soundless. 
               CAMERA FOLLOWS Haven as he moves slowly. He has replaced the 
               gun, but he is alert.

               ANGLE ON Prince as he watches Haven, now a perfect target, 
               not looking in his direction. Prince raises the gun a little, 
               but the dice in his over hand click ever so faintly.

               SHOT OF Haven as he stops dead in his tracks, hand on the 
               gun again, alert at the slight sound of the dice. Now facing 
               towards the shadow where Prince is hidden. He stands ready 
               and rigid for a long still moment. When there is no further 
               sound or movement, he goes on towards the stairs.

               ANGLE ON Prince as he moves slightly from the shadow as Haven 
               goes to the stairs. Prince is ready to shoot again, but now 
               the angle on Haven up the stairs is no good. He lowers the 
               gun with disgust, then moves softly out of the shadow.

               INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN

               She gets a gun out of the drawer, looks at it, smiles, drops 
               it back into the drawer, moves around the desk and faces the 
               door, composing herself and waiting.

               EXT. CHARLIE'S DOOR

               As Haven pauses, pushes it open. Then walks slowly in.

               INT. CHARLIE'S OFFICE - DAWN

               She is standing with her back to the desk, her fingers tight 
               on the edge of the desk as Haven walks in. He stops and looks 
               around and then at her. There is a slight smile on her face.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You cause me an awful lot of trouble.

                         If you still have that gold, and I 
                         think you do, we might make it yet. 
                         You see I believe that every man has 
                         his price.

                                     HAVEN
                         Some men don't believe that.

                                     CHARLIE
                         But every woman knows it.

               Her eyes pass him towards the door behind him.

                                     HAVEN
                         Only there wouldn't be any women on 
                         my jury.
                              (taking out his pipe)
                         And that's why you're not as bad off 
                         as you might think... I could find 
                         twelve men who might think you capable 
                         of almost anything -- but I wouldn't 
                         bet they'd vote that way after staring 
                         at you through a trial.
                              (he notes her eyes go 
                              past him)
                         Mick is dead for the murders and 
                         Prince can be hung for the rest of 
                         it...

               At the bare rustle of SOUND behind him (and the memory of 
               her eyes going past him) Haven whirls, stopping aside and 
               drawing as he does so. And just as he does so, Prince, in 
               the doorway, fires. Haven shoots so that the shots RING OUT 
               almost simultaneously. Prince topples forward on his knees 
               and then his face. The dice roll out of his unclenched left 
               hand.

               MED. SHOT of Haven and Charlie as their eyes read the dice. 
               Haven puts away the gun. Charlie is still leaning against 
               the desk, but there is a strange look on her face. A thin 
               smile for Haven. Now she sags a little and Haven realizes 
               she has been hit. He starts to her and she turns away towards 
               the couch. He catches her as she sags again, and helps her 
               down gently on the couch.

               ANGLE on couch as Haven kneels beside her. He starts to pull 
               away the top of her dress, but the wound is close to the 
               heart. She shakes her head.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's no good...

               Haven knows it. He takes her hand and squeezes it.

                                     HAVEN
                         I'll get someone --

                                     CHARLIE
                         Stay here.

               Haven stares grimly at her face. She gives him a faint smile.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Tell me something...

                                     HAVEN
                         Sure.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This gets us all. This doesn't count.

                                     HAVEN
                              (softly)
                         No...

                                     CHARLIE
                         Tell me something -- on the square.

               She holds herself tight a moment; then looks at him again, 
               the faint smile returning.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Did you ever -- love me?

                                     HAVEN
                         All the time.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (a whisper)
                         Tell it.

                                     HAVEN
                         From the first night and the first 
                         time of the song. I tried to get 
                         away from it, but every time it came 
                         back. Every time I tried to get it 
                         out of my brain I just pushed it 
                         deeper into my heart. It had to be 
                         either you or me.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's all right. I love you...
                              (as he looks hard at 
                              her)
                         Well -- say it.

                                     HAVEN
                              (softly)
                         I love you.

               She starts to die. He takes her shoulders in his hands as 
               though to kiss her or hold her back to life. Her voice is 
               almost a whisper.

                                     CHARLIE
                         See you... in China.

               She goes, slumping back. He sits there, pats her shoulder in 
               a familiar absent-minded way, then slowly rises. Grimly, 
               Haven walks out of the room.

               MOVING SHOT as Haven goes down the stairway. The deaf pianist 
               is playing as always.

               INT. HOTEL

               Orville is at his old seat behind the desk. He is playing 
               the last verse of the ballad. Haven enters and crosses to 
               his bag, his face blank and grim. He picks up his bag, turns 
               and walks out, as though not hearing the guitar and the 
               ballad. As he goes into the street --

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                         THE END
