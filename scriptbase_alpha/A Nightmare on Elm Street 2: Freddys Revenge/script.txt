                       A Nightmare on Elm Street 2:  
                         Freddy's Revenge

                         A Screenplay By:
                         David Chaskin

     BEGIN MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

     EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT - DAY

     A big, yellow SCHOOL BUS pulls up to a corner and discharges a 
     group of TEENAGERS.  It's one of those fantastic spring afternoons 
     and the kids take to their freedom like they were just sprung from 
     Leavenworth.

                              KIDS
               G'night, Joe...Have a good weekend, etc.

     The BUS DRIVER doesn't answer but nods and smiles as they deboard.  
     He is a pleasant looking elderly man, wearing a khaki work shirt, 
     a matching cap and chewing on an unlit, twenty-five cent stogie.

     The DOORS fold shut, the GEARS GRIND and the bus continues along 
     its route.

     INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

     While there are only about a dozen kids on the bus, the noise 
     level is deafening.  GIRLS are yapping, GUYS are horsing around, 
     someone is fiddling with a ghetto-blaster, trying to decide among 
     several loud stations.

     EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

     The bus turns a corner, taking them out of the development and 
     past some older, less identical looking residences spaced more 
     widely apart.

     INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

     The Driver downshifts the old heap, pulls the wheel over to the 
     curb and reaches over to push the door lever open.

     KIDS file out down he aisle, some of them wishing him well as they 
     leave.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     as the gears grind again and the bus pulls away.  We see that 
     there are only a few KIDS remaining:  TWO GIRLS sit together 
     toward the center and a lone, nerdy-looking BOY sits at the rear.

     The DRIVER is in front of an aluminum divider and, except for the 
     top of his cap, cannot be seen.

     END MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

     ON THE THREE KIDS

     The two girls are pretty, teen-fashionable and just a little 
     immature.  One of them turns back to look over her shoulder.

     CLOSER ANGLE - THE BOY

     Poor kid.  About 17, four-eyes, bad skin, lousy posture and an 
     obvious inferiority complex.  He's sweating profussely and he 
     stands slightly to unlatch and lower the window.  He pulls down on 
     it with all his strength but it is hopelessly stuck.

     He sits back down and sighs.  Suddenly, he feels the girl's stare.  
     he doesn't turn but sends his eyes over to see who's goggling at 
     him.

     ON GIRLS - JESSE'S POV

     The first girl turns back to her friend to whisper something.  The 
     friend turns around to see for herself.

     INT. BUS

     The boy stares forward now and catches her glance directly.

     The girls shift quickly in their seats to face forard and let out 
     with an uncontrollable rush of mean giggles.

     The boy is clearly embarrassed now and looks down at the books in 
     his lap.

     We hear the engine REVVING - the bus seems to be picking up speed.

     One of the girls stands, ready to get off.

     GIRL'S POV OUT WINDOW: EXT. STREET

     A MOTHER, her PRE-SCHOOL CHILD on a TRICYCLE and their DOG wait 
     for the bus to discharge the girl.

     EXT. STREET

     The bus speeds past the waiting group, to their amazement.

     INT. BUS

     The standind girl's jaw drops open as they shoot by a familiar 
     looking intersection and continue to pick up speed.

                              FIRST GIRL
                         (to her friend)
               Hey!
                         (calling to driver)
               Hey, that war our stop!

     The bus turns a sharp corner and the first girl almost falls.  The 
     second girl grips onto the seatback and lifts herself to her feet.

                              SECOND GIRL
                         (calling to the driver)
               Hey, Joe!  Our stop!

     HER POV - THE FRONT OF THE BUS

     The unseen driver ignores the calls and continues picking up 
     speed.  We might notice that his hat has changed; in place of the 
     cap, we can see the top of a BATTERED OLD FEDORA.

                              SECOND GIRL (O.C.)
               Hey, let us off!

     EXT. TWO-LANE STREET - DAY

     The sky has suddenly turned; a wave of threatening clouds sweeps 
     overhead and the WIND is churning a planting of roadside weeping 
     willows into a tangled mess of yellow tendrils.

     The bus WHINES near the top end of third, all of its FLASHERS are 
     going like the dashboard was having a major coronary.  It passes 
     the last house and heads into open terrain.

     IN THE BUS

     THE SECOND GIRL steps into the aisle and starts making her way 
     toward the front of the coach.

                              SECOND GIRL
                         (under her breath)
               Deaf old fart...

     She stops suddenly and GASPS as she watches

     THE DRIVER'S ARM

     emerge to throw the floorshift into fourth.  His hand is clad in a 
     strange GLOVE that tip his fingers with a menacing set of RAZOR-
     SHARP, STEEL TALONS.  His sleeve is charred and smoking.

     The bus SWERVES WILDLY as it skids around a corner, throwing its 
     few passengers into collision courses with the walls and each 
     other.

     A FLASH OF LIGHTNING crashes through the air.

     EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE

     As the lightning subsides, the sky is dark.  The BUS SCREAMS 
     along, banging through rocks and ditches, CRASHING through a wall 
     of overgrown brambles.  Thick clouds of steam pour out from under 
     he hood and stream back along toward the rear of the vehicle.

     ON THE BOY

     holding o to his seatback and watching out the window in terror as 
     trees TEAR loose from the ground i the bus'wake.

     We hear a LOUD RUMBLING and the bus begins to shake as if the 
     planet itself is splitting in two.

     ON THE BUS

     Skidding across the desert landscape, being THROWN to and fro 
     laterally, at the mercy of the shuddering landscape.

     ON A FRONT WHEEL

     as the tire smacks into a jagged boulder, SNAPPING the wheel from 
     its axle.

     ON THE FRONT END

     BOUNCING to a violent halt, the bumer digging a long trench into 
     the earth.

     IN THE BUS

     THE KIDS pick themselves up from the floor.  It is very hot and 
     smoky inside.  They have moved closer together now, sweating, 
     scared. Frantically, the boy tries to open a window, but it will 
     not budge.

     He looks out the window and gasps.

     EXT. POV FROM WINDOW

     THE GROUND below begins to SPLIT apart and tumble into a deep 
     fissure that is encirling the bus.

     ON THE MOOR, THE BUS CENTER

     The land is IMPLODING all around it; huge chunks of the earth's 
     crust are shearing themselves loose from the edges of the fissure 
     and tumbling into oblivion.

     In moments, the bus is stranded on the narrow tip of a towering 
     ridge of crumbling stone.

     The bus teeters precariously, tasting the smoky abyss in every 
     direction.

     INSIDE

     THE SECOND GIRL is on al fours in the aisle.  She looks up toward 
     the driver's seat.

                              SECOND GIRL
                         (seeing something
                          hideous)
               Jesus!

     She scrambles to her feet and begins backing off.  The floor of 
     the bus shifts dangerously, throwing the girl into the edge of one 
     of the seats.

     ON THE DRIVER

     as he makes his way toward the back.  We don'g see his face but he 
     is dressed in a filthy green and red sweater.  In the B.G., the 
     dashboard instruments are sparking and sending thick black fumes 
     toward the ceiling.  SMOKE is rising off his body as if he just 
     stepped out of some horrible fire.  A small patch of skin on his 
     hand sizzles and pops and drips a molten glob of flesh that burns 
     a small hole in a seat cushion.

     His Razor-Talons sweep along the tops of the seat-backs CUTTING 
     deep gashes into the green vinyl upholstery and SCRAPING horribly 
     over the tubular steel support poles.

     ON THE BOY

     Terrified.  Lookign first at the awful talons, then out the window 
     at the DEADLY DROP and back at the bus driver.

     ON THE GIRLS

     Sweating, panicking.  They back away, going from window to window, 
     trying desperately to pull them down.  They're all locked tight.  
     One reaches for the emergence door leer at the rear of the bus.  
     It comes off in her hand.

     The kids huddle together, petrified, screaming, as the driver is 
     upon her.

     CU: DRIVER

     He lifts the awful, talonned glove in f.g.  Behind, obscured by 
     smoke, we see, for an instant, his fce -- the face of FREDDY.  he 
     raises his weapon arm higher and STRIKES.

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

     INT. WALSH HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

     CLOSE on a steel blade cutting into red flesh.  We PULL BACK and 
     see that it is MOM, slicing a tomato at the kitchen counter.

     This is an all-American family; along with a MOM, there's a DAD 
     and a kid sister named NGELA and they ll are having breakfast 
     together.

     A moment later, there is a muffled, OFF-CAMERA SCREAM.  Mom looks 
     up.  We can also make out the RINGING of an alarm clock in another 
     part of the house.

     ANGELA jumps slightly at the scream.  She's a pretty little 
     eleven-year old, genuinely cute, not precocious.

                              ANGELA
                         (to Mom)
               Why can't Jesse wake up like every-
               body else?

                              MOM
                         (hushed)
               Shhh.  He must've had another night-
               mare.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. WALSH HOUSE - JESSE'S ROOM - MORNING

     ON JESSE'S BED. An alarm clock RINGS LOUDLY.

     JESSE WALSH (17) is sitting up in bed.  He's sweaty and scared and 
     disoriented as he slams his hand down on the alarm and tries to 
     shake the nightmare out of his head.

     We see that he's the boy on the bus only he's not half-bad looking 
     - far from nerdy.  he has no skin problems and he doesn't wear 
     glasses and his body's in good shape.

     As he gets out of bed, still shaky from the dream, and we see that 
     his bedroom is littered with cardboard cartons - most of them open 
     and half-empty.  He trips over a carton on his way to his jeans.

     INT. WALSH HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

     Mom is at the stove cooking eggs for her family.  She looks up, 
     worried, as Jesse comes in and heads for the refrigerator.

                              JESSE
                         (mumbles)
               'Morning.

                              MOM
                         (putting on a smile)
               'Morning, honey.

     Jesse pours himself a GLASS OF MILK from the fridge.  He joins Dad 
     and Angela family at the breakfast table.

                              DAD
               You got your room straightened out
               yet?

                              JESSE
                         (yawns)
               It's getting there.

                              DAD
               We've only been living here six weeks
               now.  I want that room unpacked by
               tonight.

     MOM comes over with some eggs for Dad.

                              MOM
                         (to Jesse)
               Want some eggs...Angela, what are you
               doing?

     ON ANGELA

     She is struggling to put her hand deep into a box of FU-MAN CHEWS 
     breakfast cereal.

                              ANGELA
                         (frustrated)
               I'm trying to get the Fu-Man Fingers!

     Printed on the box is a cartoon caricature of the Oriental doctor 
     pointing to a bowl of his product with one of his long, sharp 
     fingernails.  there's a burst above the product name that reads:  
     "FREE INSIDE - FU-MAN FINGERS" and shows a drawing of a hand 
     wearing several extra-long, red plastic fingernails on its 
     fingertips.

     Mom lets Angela go o with her search and turns back to Jesse, 
     waiting for his answer.

                              MOM
               Jess?

                              JESSE
               Huh?

                              MOM
               Eggs?

     Jesse rubs his temples.  He was away for a minute but he's back 
     now.

                              JESSE
               Oh...uh, no, just some milk, Mom.

                              MOM
               You okay?

     Dad eyes him suspicously.

                              JESSE
               Yeah, I'm fine.  Just really hot 
               upstairs.

                              MOM
                         (nods)
               I know it's warm...
                         (to Dad)
               I wish you'd call someone to check out
               the air conditioning, Ken.

                              DAD
                         (defensively)
               I know what's wrong with the air
               coditioning - just needs a shot of 
               freon, is all.

                              JESSE
               Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit
               the deck!

                              DAD
               Don't be a smart ass.

     A short silence as they all look back to their plates.

                              MOM
                         (to Jesse)
               So, school going alright?

                              JESSE
                         (shrugs)
               Okay, I guess.

                              MOM
               Making friends?

     Jesse is looking around for some escape - this interrogation is 
     getting a little too personal.

                              JESSE
               Yeah, you know how it is...

     ON ANGELA

     She grabs onto the prize at the botto of the box and gives a yank.  
     A bagful of Fu Man Fingers come out in her hand along with half 
     the box of cereal.

     SOUND OVER:  DOORBELL RINGING

     Mom turns to answer the door, but Jesse immediately jumps up and 
     cuts her off.

                              JESSE
               That's Lisa - I gotta get to school.

                              DAD
                         (calling after him)
               Who's Lisa?

     But Jesse is gone; just a kitchen door, swinging in his wake.

     INT. WALSH HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

     as JESSE opens the front door to LISA POLETTI (17).  She is facing 
     the street and she turns around when she hears the door open.  Not 
     a knock-out but real pretty, with an intelligence and sweetness 
     about her -- she is truly lovely.

                              LISA
               Hi.

     She smiles and Jesse's eyes light up.

     EXT. WALSH HOUSE - DAY

     They walk to JESSE'S CAR - a beat-up, blue Falcon parked curbside.

                              JESSE
                         (gratefully)
               your timing was perfect - I was 
               getting the third degree in there.

                              LISA
               How come?

                              JESSE
               Ah, nothing.

     Jesse opens Lisa's car door for her.  She steps in and sits down.

     IN THE CAR

     The interior is worse than the body.  The upholstery is torn to 
     shreds, the dashboard is cracked and peeling and there's a big 
     hole where the radio used to be.  A cheap, A.M. transistor radio 
     hangs by its wrist strap from the rear-view mirror.

     Jesse hops in and shifts around to get comfortable, and reaches 
     under the dash to pull out a couple of bare wires.

     Lisa watches him routinely twist the wires together, amused.

                              LISA
               Aren't you afraid somebody could
               steal your car like that?

                              JESSE
                         (preposterously)
               Look at this car.  Are you kidding?

     He sits up again and reaches for a toggle switch that has been 
     crudely drilled into the dash.  He flicks the switch.

     Jesse moves his finger to another alien button in the dash and 
     pushes it.  The STARTER turns over slowly, the engine BACKFIRES 
     and the car starts noisily.

     Jesse gives her the "thumbs up" as if he were a World War I Ace 
     and puts the car into gear.  It BUCKS and FARTS and rumbles up the 
     street.

     EXT. POOL - REAR, WALSH HOUSE - DAY

     DAD floats on a FOAM CHAIR in the middle of the rather run-down 
     pool, sipping coffee from a MUG bearing the word "DAD".  He looks 
     over his domain with satisfaction and inhales a deep breath of 
     fresh, suburban sir.

     MOM comes out the back door.  She looks just a bit worried.

                              MOM
               Ken, shouldn't you be getting to the
               office?  It's almost nine.

                              KEN
               As soon as i finish my coffee.  I'm
               enjoying my pool right now.
                         (sips his coffee)
               I love our new house.  Don't you?

                              MOM
                         (sighs heavily)
               Of course I do, Ken.

                              KEN
               What's the problem, Shirl?

                              MOM
                         (pointing behind her)
               It's just I'll be a lot happier when 
               you finish taking down those bars.

     CAMERA PANS UP AND ZOOMS IN to reveal BARS ON THE UPPER WINDOWS -- 
     this is the old Thompson house, replete with the security 
     paraphernalia that kept Nancy Thompson prisoner five years prior.

                              MOM (O.C.)
               People that lived here before must
               have been truly paranoid.

     EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

     Establishing shot of school, shot from parking lot with JESSE'S 
     CAR in f.g.  School is in session, so the only students we see are 
     TWO CLASS-CUTTERS leaning against a car passing a JOINT.

     EXT. HIGHT SCHOOL PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

     An intramural SOFTBALL GAME is in progress.  COACH SCHNEIDER, a 
     nasty looking ex-Marine, stands behind home plate as an umpire.

     JESSE is covering second base.

     RONNY GRADY, a tough-looking wise-ass type, steps up to the plate.  
     He knocks the mud off his sneakers with his bat and takes his 
     stance.

     ON JESSE

     He glances over to the adjacent field.

     HIS POV

     The GIRLS are in the middle of archery instruction.

     LISA is there, mighty tempting looking in her little, powder blue 
     gym suit, a quiver strapped to her shoulder and a longbow in her 
     hand.

     KERRY, a dizzy, Bloomingdale's-punk, steps up alongside Lisa as 
     the latter catches Jesse's stare.

                              SCHNEIDER (O.C.)
               Strike!

                              KERRY
                         (to Lisa, re Jesse)
               He made any moves yet?

     Lisa smiles and waves to Jesse.

                              LISA
                         (aside to Kerry)
               I only know him a few weeks, Kerry.

     ON JESSE

     He waves back.

     BACK TO LISA AND KERRY

                              KERRY
               I think he needs a push start.

     Lisa turns to face the target, slides an arrow into the nocking 
     point, draws back the bowstring and lets the arrow go.

     ON THE TARGET

     It's a bull's-eye.

     CRACK!

     GRADY gets hold of a perfect pitch and sends it flying over the 
     head of the PITCHER.

     BACK TO JESSE

     BOOM!

     The ball skids off the side of his head and the kid collapses. 

     HIS TEAMMATES rush to his side and help Jesse to his feet.  He's 
     more embarrassed than hurt and he waves away any over-attention.  
     COACH SHNEIDER joins the circle of bodies around him.

                              SCHNEIDER
               You okay?

                              JESSE
               Yeah, I'm fine.

                              SCHNEIDER
                         (walking away)
               Well, pay attention, next time!

     Jesse re-takes his position on the base.

                              GRADY (O.C.)
               Maybe you oughta try something a little
               more your speed, Walsh.  Like knitting.

     Jesse just now realizes that it was Grady who scored a double off 
     his skull.  He's standing just off the bag, harassing Jesse while 
     waiting to be hit home.

                              JESSE
                         (flipping him the bird)
               Knit this, Grady.

     GRADY sneers and gives him the "JACK-OFF" sign.

     JESSE tosses an "ITALIAN SALUTE", slapping one hand into the crook 
     of his arm and throwing up "THE FINGER" for good measure.

     GRADY grabs his own crotch and points to it obscenely.

     ON THE PITCHER

     He sends one over the plate, the BATTER catches it dead-center and 
     POUNDS it back to left field.
 
     GRADY makes a break for third, only to be forced back by teh LEFT 
     FIELDER tossing the ball to the THIRD BASEMAN.

     ON JESSE

     His glove up to receive the throw as Grady STEAMS towards him.

     The ball snaps into Jesse's mitt and Grady turns on his ankles to 
     shoot back to third.

     Jesse and the third baseman toss the ball between, each time 
     moving closer in toward Grady.  Grady switches directions with the 
     ball, trapped between them.

     GRADY dives into a HEAD-FIRST SLIDE, trying to sneak past Jesse.

     JESSE swoops down and tags him out.

     Thorougly aggravated, Grady rises to his feet by reaching out and 
     grabbing onto Jesse's gym shorts and yanking them down to his 
     ankles, revealing jesse's bare buns-in-a-jockstrap to the world.

     JESSE lunges for Grady, trips over his shorts and the two of them 
     begin rolling around in the dirt, duking it out.

     ON THE GIRLS IN THE NEXT FIELD

     watching the wrestling match with ausement.

     ON LISA AND KERRY

     Lisa tries like hell to repress some laughter.

                              KERRY
               Cut ass.

     ON SCNEIDER

     pushing his way through a crowd of laughing, cheering SPECTATORS 
     and jumping in to break up the scuffle.

     He lifts both boys up by their necks.

                              SCHNEIDER
               Okay boys, assume the position!

     INT. COACH'S OFFICE - DAY

     Schneider is at his desk.  TWO BOYS carrying gym bags pass outside 
     the Coach's office.  They wave to him through the WIRE-GLASS 
     WINDOWS.

                              BOYS
               'Night Coach.

     Schneider gives them a cold glance.

     He checks his watch, gets up and goes to a window to look outside.

     HIS POV - THE PRACTICE FIELD

     JESSE and GRADY, side by side in the center of the baseball 
     diamond.  They are in "front-leaning rest" position, the cruel and 
     painful frozen pushup that ends halfway to the ground with elbows 
     bent.

     We don't know how long they've been out there but it's probably 
     hours.  It seems just a little darker out and a lonely wind is 
     blowing around their arms and legs.

     In the B.G., KIDS are filing out of the building - some sop to 
     look out at the two boys, point and snicker.

     ANGLE:

     We see LISA among the kids.  She stops for a moment and views the 
     scene with concern.

     ON JESSE AND GRADY

     They are dirty, their shirts are ripped and Jesse has a tiny 
     bruise over his cheek.

     And they're tired too.  The muscles in their arms are twitching 
     convulsively and they talk to each other between groans and 
     through teeth clenched with pain.

     We hear the OFF-CAMERA SOUND of several busses pulling out.

                              JESSE
               How much longer you figure he'll keep
               us out here?

                              GRADY
               Could be all night.
                         (nodding in the Coach's
                          direction)
               Guy gets his rocks off like this.
               Hangs out in queer S & M joints
               downtown.  Likes prettyboys like
               you.

                              JESSE
               Get outa here.

     Grady doesn't pursue it.  Instead, he looks around and tries to 
     think of some small-talk.

                              GRADY
                         (finally)
               So, what about you and that Poletti
               girl?

                              JESSE
               What about it?

                              GRADY
               You two got a thing going, or what?

                              JESSE
               She's a neighbor, I drive her to
               school.

                              GRADY
               She giving you any carfare for the 
               ride?

                              JESSE
               You got a problem with me, Grady?

                              GRADY
                         (shrugs)
               Naw. Just killing time.

     SOUND OVER:  A WHISTLE BLOWING

     ON THE COACH

     Dressed in his street clothes, crossing the field toward the 
     faculty parking lot.  He pulls the whistle from his mouth.

                              SCHNEIDER
                         (to the boys)
               Okay boys, hit the showers.

     INT. BOYS LOCKER ROOM - DAY

     JESSE and GRADY stand at opposite ends of a row of lockers and 
     change into their street clothes.  Their movements are slow and 
     cumbersome - like a pair of creaky old men.

                              GRADY
                         (finally)
               So, you live around here.

                              JESSE
                         (sighs wearily)
               Not too far.  My folks bought a place
               over on Elm Street.

     Grady stops buttoning his shirt and looks up at Jesse.

                              GRADY
               Elm Street?  You telling me you moved
               in to that big white house with the
               bars on the windows?

                              JESSE
               Yeah, why?

     Grady shakes his head and tucks his shirtails in.

                              GRADY
               Shit, you can tell your old man he's 
               a real chump.

                              JESSE
               What the hell are you talking about?

                              GRADY
               They've only been trying to unload 
               that dump for five years.  That 
               place is bad news.  Some chick was
               locked in there by her mother and
               she went crazy.  She watched her 
               boyfriend get butchered by some 
               maniac in the house across the street.  
               Her poor drunken momma took her own
               life right inside your front door.

     Jesse stares dubiously at Grady.

                              JESSE
                         (with a nervous laugh)
               You're full of shit.

     Jesse pulls his knapsack from the locker shelf, slams the door 
     shut and walks away.

     ON GRADY

     He smiles mischievously and shuts his own locker door.

     EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

     JESSE'S CAR is parked among a handful of others.  LISA leans 
     against the front fender, waithing patiently.

     HER POV

     JESSE steps out of the building and spots her.  he hurries across 
     the lot.

     ON LISA

     as Jesse approaches.

                              JESSE
                         (surprised to see her)
               Hi!  You didn't have to wait.

                              LISA
               That's okay, I wanted to.

     He raises an eyebrow as he opens the door for her.  He likes that.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     as Jesse slides in beside her and STARTS the engine.

     She looks him over.  He looks like he's been through the mill a 
     couple of times.

                              LISA
               You okay?

                              JESSE
               Yeah, yeah, sure.

                              LISA
               Let me look at your eye...

     Jesse lifts his chin to show off the tiny bruise over his 
     cheekbone.  He looks almost a little proud of it - like it's an 
     old war wound.  Lisa touches it tenderly.

                              LISA
               You shouldn't be fighting with that
               jerk.

                              JESSE
               Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's 
               just a hothead.

                              LISA
               You mean a shithead.

                              JESSE
                         (laughs)
               Yeah.

     He guns the engine and they pull away.

     EXT. WALSH HOUSE - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT

     It's very late.  The house is dark and even the crickets have hit 
     the sack.

     INT. JESSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     JESSE's having trouble sleeping.  He turns over on different sides 
     and punches up his pillow a couple of times, stares into space and 
     finally sits up.

     He gets out of bed, pulls on a pair of pants and exits.

     KITCHEN

     He enters.  The room is lit only by the glow of a three quarter 
     moon.

     He regains his composure and steps over to the sink to pull off an 
     absurd length of paper toweling.

     We see it just when Jesse does;  a GROTESQUE FACE has been peering 
     into the window all this time.  It disappears from view on Jesse's 
     DOUBLE TAKE.

     Jesse stops for a moment to slow down his heart.  He takes a deep 
     breath and steps up to the back door.

     He opens the door.

     EXT. SIDE OF WALSH HOUSE - NIGHT

     Jesse opens the gate and enters.  It is really quiet; not even 
     night-sounds.

     He strains to see past the shrubbery that surrounds the house.

                              JESSE
                         (hoarse whisper)
               Grady?

     He looks around.

                              JESSE
               It better be you, you son of a bitch!

     We hear an awful sound from somewhere - WOOD RIPPIGNG.

     Jesse makes his way cautiously along the side of the house.

     He notices a red-orange LIGHT is flickering from behind a cellar 
     window.  He gets down on his hands and knees to investigate.

     THE CELLAR - HIS POV

     An INTRUDER is bent over by the furnace, lit only by a raging fire 
     in the fire-box.  He puts his hand right into the flames and 
     begins digging for something way in the back of the furnace.  We 
     can't see his face but he is dressed in a filthy green and red 
     striped sweater and a battered hat.

     He pulls out a bundle of rags, sets it on top of the furnace and 
     proceeds to unwrap it.

     ON JESSE

                              JESSE
                         (petrified)
               Holy shit...

     He stands up and looks around frantically.  He doesn't know what 
     to do.

                              JESSE
                         (near tears)
               Holy shit...

     He hurries out the gate that leads to the front of the house.

     INT. WALSH HOUSE - NIGHT

     Jesse enters the house and scans the foyer.  He heads toward the      
     cellar door.  It is ajar -- the LOCKHAS BEEN SPLINTERED AS IF BY A 
     HUGE WRECKING BAR -- and we can hear the ROAR of the furnace from 
     below.

     He sticks his head inside the cellar door and peeks down.

     HIS POV

     The SHADOW OF A FIGURE; movement on the cellar walls.

     ON JESSE

     Breathing heavily.  Brain whirring.

     SLAM!

     He pulls the basement door closed and holds it shut tight, 
     practically hyper-ventilating.

                              JESSE
                         (screaming)
               Dad!

     He looks around frantically.

                              JESSE
               DAD!

     Something inside starts to pull the cellar door open.  Jesse tries 
     to hold it shut, but the inexorable force continues to inch it 
     open.

     Jesse lets go and bolts toward the foyer.  FREDDY is standing in 
     his path, a sick smile on his scarred face.  He flashes his razor-
     knives at Jesse.

                              FREDDY
                         (sinisterly)
               Daddy can't help you now.

     Jesse tries to make a break for it but Freddy is too fast.  His 
     un-taloned hand gets an iron grip on Jesse's shirt collar.

                              FREDDY
               I've been waiting five years for you,
               Jesse.  We got special work to do, you
               and me.  Things are really gonna heat
               up.

     Jesse struggles to get free.  Freddy tightens his iron grip and 
     fans his talons threateningly.  Jesse's head stretches back from 
     the chocking pain.

                              FREDDY
               We'll do real good together, you and
               me.

     Freddy hurls Jesse against the wall.

                              FREDDY
               You got the body...
                         (doffs his hat)
               I got the brains.

     With that, Freddy removes his hat.  There is no skull under there 
     - just a pulsating mass of blody BRAIN MATTER.

     JESSE lets out an agonized SCREAM.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. JESSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     ON JESSE, still in bed but his entire body arched backwards over 
     the mattress.  His scream continues until he collapses back down 
     into the sheets.

     ON HIS DOOR

     It flies open and DAD crashes into the room, followed by MOM.  
     They go to his bedside and stare at him as he pants and coughs his 
     way back to consciousness.

                              MOM
                         (to Dad)
               Maybe we should call a doctor.

                              JESSE
               No.  I'm okay.

     He sits up to prove it.

                              JESSE
               Really.  Just a bad dream.

     INT. HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - DAY

     A rather bored looking group of STUDENTS is listening with little 
     interest to the droning of their teacher, MR ABLE, who is 
     lecturing them from the front of the room.

                              MR. ABLE
               So, to review, the solid waste, those
               nutrients that are not absorbed in the
               lining of the stomach, the large 
               intestine, the small intestine - the
               alimentary canal - are passed out 
               through the colon...

     SOUND OVER:  A FAKE FART

     LAUGHTER from the class.

     ABLE looks up crossly from his notes until the laughs trail off.

                              MR. ABLE (O.C.)
                         (continues)
               The liquid nutrients are then carried
               through an elaborate system of filtering,
               aided by the pancreas, liver and gall
               bladder...

     TWO GIRLS at the back of the room look at each other.  One puts 
     her finger in her mouth and pretends to gag.

     As Able DRONES on in the B.G., we're

     ON JESSE

     He's having a hell of a time keeping his eyes open.  His head bobs 
     intermittently as he starts to nod out.

     ON GRADY

     He nudges a CLASSMATE at the next desk to look over toward Jesse.  
     They snicker.

     ON JESSE, THEIR POV

     nodding out

     BACK TO ABLE

                              MR. ABLE
               Or collected in the bladder to be expelled
               at a later time.  And this entire process
               is kept moving through "the circulatory
               system", the center of which is...
                         (a beat)
               ...the heart.

     On the beat, he reaches under his lab table and plunks a BLOODY 
     CALF'S HEART down right in the center of it.

     We hear DISGUSTED GROANS from the class.

                              MR. ABLE
               ...Four chambers, just like the human
               heart, really.

     Able describes the path by sticking his index finger into each 
     orifice.

                              MR ABLE
               From the body, through the right auricle,
               to the right ventricle and out the 
               pulmonary artery to the lungs.

     BACK TO JESSE, ASLEEP

     A particularly ugly and ferocious looking SNAKE is wrapping itself 
     around his arm, making its way toward Jesse's face.

     CLOSE ON JESSE

     As he wakes up slowly and looks down groggily toward his arm.

     THE SNAKE

     opens wide and emitsa long demonic hiss.

     Jesse screams and hastily begins pulling the reptile away from 
     him.

     ON ABLE

     Standing next to Jesse, he pulls the snake off his arm and drops 
     it into a nearby tank.

                              MR. ABLE
               If you want to play with animals, Mr.
               Walsh, join the circus.

     GUFFAWS from the class.

     JESSE looks around, bewildered and embarrassed.

     He spots GRADY, grinning widely.

     INT. THE WALSH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

     Comfortable and very suburban.  A major color T.V. takes up the 
     wall opposite a pair of His and Hers Barcaloungers.

     DAD is watching The Six O'clock News on the tube and fanning 
     himself with a T.V. Guide.

     MOM sits on the couch with ANGELA, helping her with a jigsaw 
     puzzle.

     TWO PARAKEETS are fluttering around inside a cage near the entry 
     into the dining room.

     JESSE bounces down the stairway, a rolled towel tucked under his 
     arm.

     DAD stares at him angrily then turns back to the game.

     JESSE CROSSES in front of the set on his way out of the room.

                              DAD
               Where are you going?

                              JESSE
               Just out for a while.

                              DAD
                         (shaking his head)
               I told you I want that room unpacked.

                              JESSE
                         (begging)
               Oh, come on Dad...

                              DAD
               No.
                         (pointing toward the
                          stairway)
               Upstairs.

     Jesse's about to protest but Dad cuts him off.

                              DAD
                         (firmly)
               Now.

     Jesse turns around, mumbles something under his breath and stomps 
     back upstairs.

     EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE -EARLY EVENING

     A pair of glass sliders lead from the house onto a stretch of 
     patio that surrounds a gorgeous built-in swimming pool.  The patio 
     is dotted with all the amenities of backyard recreation: a gas 
     bar-b-que grill, a wet-bar, plenty of pipe furniture and even a 
     pair of free-standing cabanas.  The entire set-up is contained by 
     a six-foot, chain link security fence.

     LISA steps out of the cabana, wearing a swim suit.  She tosses her 
     towel onto a nearby chair and crosses to the diving board.

     ON THE BOARD

     She bounces lightly and jumps off, cutting gracefully through the 
     water and coming up in the center of the pool.

     MRS. POLETTI, a pleasant looking woman in her late 40's, slides 
     open the patio doors and pokes her head out.

                              MRS. POLETTI
                         (calling)
               There's a Jesse on the phone.

                              LISA (O.C.)
               Okay...thanks.

     LISA swims to the edge of the pool and hoists herself up.  She 
     throws the towel over her shoulders and picks up a wireless phone 
     from a low table.

                              LISA
               Jesse, hi...
                         (a beat, diappointed)
               Oh...that's okay.  Sorry you can't
               make it.
                         (a beat)
               No, I understand.  Parents can be
               real pains...I'll see you in the 
               morning, then...

     She hangs up and frowns.

     INT. WALSH HOUSE - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     JESSE stands at the foot of the bed, surveying the job unhappily 
     and trying to figure out where to start.

     Finally, he pulls a SHOE BOX from inside a larger carton, places 
     it on his desk and lifts the lid.

     It's full of cassette tapes.  He rifles through them, selecting 
     one and popping it inot a PORTABLE CASSETTE PLAYER on the desk.

     He pushes the "play" button.  The tape is ROCK AND ROLL.

     The music gets him moving a bit.  He surveys the room, then goes 
     to A CARTON NEAR THE BOOKSHELVES.  He reaches deep into the near-
     empty carton and pulls out a stack of books which he plops on the 
     shelves next to other books already unpacked.  He tosses the 
     carton aside.

     He's getting into the music now as he spins around to face the 
     bureau.  He opens a SMALL POX on the bureau while be-bopping along 
     and pulls out a PAIR OF SUNGLASSES which he puts on, practically 
     dancing.  He dumps the contents of the box haphazardly into a 
     bureau drawer.

     JESSE opens a large bureau drawer.  He grbs a nearby box and dumps 
     it into the large drawer, smoothing it over perfunctorily with his 
     hands.  A Stetson cowboy hat is on top.  He drops it on his head 
     and pulls it down low over his eyes.

     ON A FULL LENGTH MIRROR

     Jesse steps into frame to get a look at himself.  He likes what he 
     sees as he mimes a guitar riff along with the music.

     In one smooth move, in rhythm with the music, he seings around and 
     moves to the desk.  He dumps a SMALL BOX OF PENCILS AND SUPPLIES 
     into the desk drawer.  As an afterthought, he grabs a couple of 
     pencils out of the drawer and drums a few beats on the desk with 
     them.

     He shoves the pencils up his nostrils, tucks his thumbs under his 
     armpits and waves his elbows like he's doing the "Funky Chicken".  
     Silly stuff that one owuld only do behind closed doors.

     He spins around, throwing his arms out and stopping ddead in his 
     tracks.

     HIS POV

     LISA and MOM are standing in his doorway.  Mom looks horrified.  
     Lisa represses a giggle.

     Mom reaches over and knocks timidly on the open door.

     Jesse hastily pulls the pencils out of his nose and dives for the 
     stereo to turn it off.  Beet-red, he tosses the hat and sun 
     glasses onto the bed and tries to look nonchalant.

                              JESSE
                         (embarrassed)
               Hi.

     Jesse looks to Mom who takes the hint and turns to leave.  Lisa 
     takes a step into the room.

                              LISA
                         (when Mom is out of
                          range)
               I told her you invited me over.  I
               guess I should have called, huh?

     Behind the embarrassment, he's glad to see her.  He puts the 
     pencils in the desk drawer and shuts it.

                              JESSE
               No, that's okay.  I was just...unpacking.

                              LISA
               I know.

     Lisa casually steps over to a carton and peeks in.

                              LISA
               I figured you might like some help.

                              JESSE
                         (pleasantly surprised)
               Yeah?

     JESSE'S ROOM - LATER

     The room is shaping up nicely with only a few boxes remaining.

     Jesse pulls a bundle wrapped in newspapers from a carton.  He 
     tears away the paper, revealing a baseball trophy.

     He places it on a conspicuous corner of his dresser.

     Lisa reaches into the box, retrieves an aerosol can and looks at 
     it.

     ON THE CAN

     A medicated spray for JOCK ITCH.

                              LISA (O.C.)
               Where does this go?

     JESSE grabs the can from her hand and puts it down on the dresser 
     behind the trophy.

                              JESSE
                         (mortified)
               There's a box of sweaters over there 
               if you want to put them up in the 
               closet.

     Lisa is anxious to pitch in.  She nods good-naturedly and steps 
     over to her assignment.

                                                       CUT TO:

     INSIDE THE CLOSET

     As Lisa opens the door and pulls an overhead chain to switch on 
     the light.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     as she drags a chair over, lifts a pile of sweaters from an open 
     box, steps up on the chair and stacks them on a shelf.  She starts 
     to step back down when something catches her attention in  the 
     back corner of the shelf.

     She reaches in and pulls out a small, red leatherbound book.

                              LISA
               What's this?

     Jesse steps over to look at it.

     ON THE BOOK

     about two-thirds the size of an average paperback, it has a 
     matching leather thong that snaps into a small latch on the front 
     and opens the book.

                              LISA
                         (reading)
               "Nancy Thompson, 1428 Elm..."
                         (looking up at him)
               Hey, this thing is five years old.

     Jesse steps over and looks over her shoulder.

                              JESSE
               You know her?

                              LISA
                         (shaking her head)
               Uh-uh.  Before my time.

     She turns a few pages.

                              LISA
                         (reading)
               "February 17th - My birtday.  Daddy      
               came by today with a big ol' stuffed 
               bear for me.  He took me to dinner 
               and a movie and when we got back, he 
               and Mother had another one of their 
               fights.  He left angry.  I wish they
               would stop fighting..."

     Jesse waves the diary away, uninterested.  He crosses back to 
     continue unpacking.

                              LISA
               I think it's sad...

                              JESSE
                         (cynically)
               Traumas of a ten-year old.

     Lisa leafs through a few more pages, stops and begins reading with 
     widening eyes.  She glances at Jesse and smiles impishly.

                              LISA
                         (reading)
               "March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep 
               with him again.  I can't yet - I 
               like him, I want to make him happy 
               but I'm not sure that I love him.  
               I can't sleep with someone I don't 
               love."

                              JESSE
               That's typical.  I hope she didn't
               expect to make the best seller list 
               with this thing.

     Lisa ignores him and scans the page.

                              LISA
                         (finding something)
               Wow, listen to this!
                         (reading)
               "Sometimes, when I'm lying here in 
               bed, I can see Glen, in his window
               across the way, getting ready for
               bed.  His body is slim and smooth
               and I know I shouldn't watch but
               that part of me that wants him
               forces me to.  That's when I
               weaken.  That's when I want to go
               to him..."

     Jesse is suddenly interested.  He walks over and Lisa hands him 
     the diary with the page open to that entry.

     He reads it and quickly turns the page.  He frowns and turns 
     another, then another.

                              JESSE
               That's it?
                         (another couple of
                          pages)
               Wait, she skipped a week.
                         (reading)
               "March 15 - he comes to me at night.
               Horrible.  Ugly.  Dirty.  Under the
               sheets with me, tearing at my night-
               gown with his steel claw..."

     Jesse's voice trails off on "claw" and a chill of vague 
     recognition goes through him.  He checks the cover of te book and 
     flips back a few pages.

     Lisa moves closer to read over his shoulder.

     Jesse composes himself and looks back at the book.

                              JESSE
                         (reading)
               "His name is Fred and he keeps taking
               me to the boiler room.  He wants to
               kill me."

     Jesse almost shivers.  He turns the page, and he freezes.

                              LISA
               What is it?

     ON THE DIARY

     Jesse shows her the page.  There is one sentence scrawled across 
     the next entry.  Lisa reads it.

                              LISA
               "Tina is dead."

     ON JESSE AND LISA

     They look at each other, spooked.  He turns the page.

                              JESSE
                         (reading)
               "Rod's been killed - he got Rod.
               Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall
               asleep!"

                              LISA
               Wow...

     Jesse's face turns ashen as he looks up at Lisa.

                              LISA
               Are you okay.

                              JESSE
                         (nodding; covering)
               Something Grady told me today about
               the people that lived here last. 
               Girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend
               killed in the house across the 
               street...

     He is interrupted by Mom, poking her head into the room.

                              MOM
                         (cheerfully)
               How's it going?

     Jesse instinctively hides the diary behind his back.

                              JESSE
               Okay...

     She looks over the room, impressed at the progress.

                              MOM
               Looks great!  Thought you might want
               to take a break - got some cold cider
               downstairs.

     Jesse looks at Lisa to see what she wants to do.

     Lisa looks over at Jese's alarm clock.  THe time is 8 P.M.

                              LISA
                         (standing up)
               No...thanks.  I better get back.
                         (to Jesse)
               Got a major paper due the end of this
               week.

                              MOM
                         (ducking back out)
               Well, it's there if you change your 
               mind.

     Jesse waits for her to leave.

                              JESSE
                         (to Lisa)
               Are you sure?

                              LISA
                         (nods sourly)
               World History.
                         (brightening)
               But, I'll see you in the morning, right?

     Jesse nods.

                              LISA
                         (pointing to the diary)
               Hot stuff.  Let me know how it turns
               out.

     Jesse opens the door for her.

                              JESSE
               I'll walk you downstairs.

     INT. WALSH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     MOM wraps the night-cover over the BIRD CAGE.  She steps past 
     ANGELA on the couch and crosses in front of DAD, in his recliver, 
     vegetating in front of the tube.  SHe sits and loosens her collar 
     a bit.

     ON DAD

     He shifts uncomfortably and wipes some beaded sweat from his upper 
     lip.

                              MOM
                         (to Dad)
               A little warm in here, huh?

     Dad gets up from his chair.  His shirt is sticky with 
     perspiration.

     Jesse steps in from the dining room, a glass of milk in his hand.

     ON ANGELA

     looking up at Jesse.  She puts a finger to her lips.

                              ANGELA
               Shhh...The birds are sleeping.

     Jesse notices the intense heat in the room immediately.  His eyes 
     widen portentiously.

     ON DAD

     at the thermostat.

                              DAD
                         (astounded)
               It's 97 degrees in here!

     He pulls off the coverplate and starts fiddling with the coil.

     Suddenly, a LOUD SQUAWK from the other side of the room makes 
     everyone look up.

     Jesse puts his milk down on he T.V. and hurries over to the cage, 
     ripping the cover away.

     ON THE BIRD CAGE

     Another series of HORRIBLE CRIES as one of the budgies proceeds to 
     rip up the neck of the other one with his sharp beak.

     LONGER ANGLE:

     Jesse throws open the door and tries to pull the attacking bird 
     off his victim.  the vicious one continues the rabid attacks on 
     Jesse's hand, drawing blood.

     As Jesse pulls his arm out, the bird flies out into the living 
     room, roaring a repetitive WAR-CRY that is eerie and unnatural for 
     something that size.

     MOM and DAD jump to their feet.  ANGELA starts screaming at the 
     top of her lungs.

     ON THE BIRD

     It circles around the ceiling and then DIVES for Dad, cutting a 
     deep gash under his eye.  It seems much larger than it was before 
     - maybe twice its original size.

                              DAD
                         (screaming)
               Get a broom or something!

     ANGLE: LIVING ROOM

     Mom dashes out of the room.

     THE BIRD swoops down, heading for Angela but crashing into the 
     shade of a table lamp, knocking it to the floor.

     It flutters to the ceiling and hovers near a light fixture.  Its 
     beak and most of its head is covered in blood and it opens its 
     mouth to emit a gutteral growl.

     MOM returns with a broom and hands it to Dad.

     As Dad approaches and lifts the broom to his shoulder, the bird 
     screams agai and dives for Jesse.
     
     Jesse throws his arm out to block the attack.  The bird reverses 
     direction and Dad swings in mid-air with the broom.

     He misses, demolishing the remaining table lamp instead.

     ON THE BIRD

     It hovers again in the air, seemingly without any means of 
     support, PUFFING UP, GROWING ANGRIER, MORE DEMONIC.  Then, just as 
     it seems ready for a last lethal attack, there is a loud BANG and 
     the bird literally EXPLODES into FLAMES in mid-air.

     The family looks at one another in horror and disbelief.  The only 
     sound in the room is ANGELA, attached to her mother's leg and 
     whimpering quietly.

     INT. WALSH HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     CRASH!

     DAD      dumps an odd assortment of home handyan tools on the kitchen 
     table.  He picks through them, selecting a pipe wrench and a screw 
     driver.

     He crosses to the stove.  We see Mom in the B.G., standing, not 
     quite cowering, still in shock from the bird attack.

     Jesse is leaning on the counter, next to the range, watching his 
     father's determined moves.

     Dad leans into the appliance and attempts to pull it away from the 
     wall, probably tearing six or seven ligaments in the process.

     After several tries, he stops and looks up at his son.

                              DAD
               Help me with this thing!

                              JESSE
               It's not the gas, Dad!

                              DAD
                         (angrily)
               Don't tell me it's not the gas!

     He yanks on the stove with more vehemence.

                              DAD
               Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your
               mother thought she smelled gas.

                              MOM
                         (timidly)
               I wasn't sure, Ken...

                              DAD
                         (to Mom)
               Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies?
               That cheap seed you've been buying?

                              MOM
                         (resenting that)
               Oh, please...

                              DAD
               What is it then?  There's got to be an
               explanation.  Animals just don't burst
               into flames for no reason!

                              JESSE
               Well it sure isn't leaky gas pipes.

     Dad stands up suddenly, CRACKING his head on the edge of the range 
     hood.

                              MOM
                         (concerned)
               Ken!

     As he groans in pain, he's suddenly hit with a revelation.  He 
     points an accusatory finger at Jesse.

                              DAD
               You set this all up, didn't you?  One
               of your sick jokes?

                              JESSE
               What are you talking about?

                              DAD
               You know what I'm talking about.  What
               did you use, a fire cracker?  A cherry
               bomb?

     Jesse is angry now.

                              JESSE
               I don't have to listen to this!

     He storms out of the kitchen.

                              DAD
               Come back here!

                              MOM
                         (upset)
               Ken!

     Dad looks blankly at the wrench in his trembling hand.

                              DAD
               I don't know...I don't know, Shirl.
               He used to be a good kid.

                                                       CUT TO:

     EXT. JESSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Dark again, sleeping soundly.

     INT. WALSH HOME - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Jesse emerges from his room and eases the door shut as quietly as 
     possible.  He stops to listen for any signs of his parents being 
     awake.

     SOUND OVER: SNORES FROM BEHIND THEIR BEDROOM DOOR

     He steps lightly past their room adn toward the head of the 
     stairs.

     WE FOLLOW Jesse as he descends the stairs into the darkened foyer.

     THE CELLAR DOOR

     Jesse stops there, momentarily losing his nerve.

     He finally turns the knob and opens the door.

     INT. WALSH HOME - CELLAR - NIGHT

     Jesse pulls an overhead chain, flooding the cellar with light.

     It's just as he saw it in his dream but devoid of any intruders.

     he steps up the the furnace, squats down and opens the firebox 
     door.  He reaches in.  To his horror, he feels something and pulls 
     out an object, wrapped in rags.

     ON THE OBJECT

     as he unwraps it.  An old, beat leather glove with a row of rusty 
     knife blades protruding from the fingers.

     Suddenly, the furnace switches on with a ROAR.

     FLAMES are leaping out of the firebox.

                              FREDDY (O.C.)
                         (laughingly)
               Hot enough for you?

     JESSE reels around.

     FREDDY is just across the room.

                              FREDDY
                         (re: the glove)
               Go ahead, Jesse.  Try it on for size!

     Jesse looks at the glove.  The blades are no longer rusted but 
     gleaming and sharp.

     he throws the weapon to the floor.  Freddy moves in closer.

                              JESSE
               What do you want?

                              FREDDY
               I need you to finish my work.  Let me
               teach you, Jesse.  We'll have fun.  
               You like my little trick with the 
               bird?

     Freddy advances.  Jesse steps behind a stack of cartons.

                              FREDDY
               Kill for me.
                         (laughing)
               c'mon Jesse.  Come to Freddy.

     Jesse pushes over a stack of cartons in his path and dives for the 
     steps.

     Halfway up he misses his footing and slips, tumbling back down.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     As Jesse comes to at the foot of the cellar steps.  The furnace 
     has stopped and Freddy is gone.  As he gets to his feet, he 
     notices.

     THE GLOVE

     on te floor, where he dropped it as shiny and new as the day it 
     was made.

     INT. WALSH HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

     MOM, DAD, and ANGELA are all at the breakfast table, picking at 
     their food; none of them is particularly hungry this morning.

     JESSE enters and heads wordlessly to a coffee pot on the stove.  
     he pours himself a cup and turns abound to face his family.

     Jesse and Dad are making an extra effort to avoid each other's eye 
     contact.

     ON ANGELA

     She's still feeling bad, drawing little circles in a puddle of 
     maple syrup with a corner of her waffle.

                              JESSE
                         (to Dad, suddenly)
               Why did it take them five years to sell
               this house, Dad?

     Dad shrugs his shoulders uncomfortably.

                              DAD
               I don't know.  COuldn't get the right
               price, I suppose.

                              JESSE
               And you don't know anything about a 
               murder across the street and a 
               crazy girl who lived here - who 
               saw the whole thing?

     Mom looks at Dad.  This is all news to her.

                              DAD
                         (testily)
               I don't know.
                         (a beat, coming clean)
               They told me something about it, yeah.
               What difference does it make?

     He feels Mom's stare and finally turns to her.

                              DAD
               Oh, come on, Shirl, how'd you think
               we got such a good deal?
                         (to Jesse)
               Listen - all old houses have stories.

                              JESSE
               Did they tell you she went totally 
               out of her mind - that they had to
               put her away?  And that her mother
               killed herself in our living room?

     ON ANGELA

     She slides up to Mom.

                              ANGELA
               Mommy, I'm scared.

                              MOM
                         (comforting her)
               Shhhhh.  Jesse and Daddy are just
               making believe, sweetheart.
                         (to Jesse)
               I don't think we should be talking
               about this now.

     Dad turns back to Jesse.

                              DAD
                         (indicating Angela)
               You see what you're doing?  Now I
               don't want to hear another word
               about it.  There's nothing wrong 
               with this house!

     ON MOM

     he looks up from Angela and sniffs the air.

                              MOM
               Something burning?

     Mom and Dad oth look toward the counter-top.

     THE TOASTER, THEIR POV

     GLOWING RED-HOT and then, not just smokey toast but FLAMES leaping 
     out of the bread slots.

     Mom gasps and Dad jumps to his feet, grabs a dish-towel and begins 
     beating out the fire.

     JESSE turns white as he watches the scene.

     Dad turns white as he watches the scene.

     DAD turns away from the smoldering toaster, tosses the towel aside 
     and heads back toward the table.

                              DAD
               Craziest damn thing I ever saw - wasn't
               even plugged in.

     Jesse puts his cut down hard on the counter and walks out.  THe 
     screen door slams behind him.

     Mom looks at Dad, horrified as Anglea clings to ehr side.

     EXT. MC DONALD'S PARKING LOT - DAY

     IN JESSE'S CAR

     As JESSE unrolls the bundle of rags he found the night before and 
     lets the finger knives drop with a CLATTER on the seat between 
     himself and LISA.

     On Lisa's side of the dashboard we see the remnants of a big, 
     fast-food breakfast;  Egg McMuffin, danish, orange juice and 
     coffee.  Jesse nurses a cup of joe as Lisa picks up the glove and 
     examines it with interest.

                              LISA
               This is amazing!  Your dream told you
               where this was?

                              JESSE
                         (nods)
               Only it was more like, you know, sleep-
               walking.  All I know is I woke up on
               the cellar floor next to it.

     He reaches into his knapsack and pulls out the diary.

                              JESSE
               Forget about going back to sleep after
               that.  I was up all night.
                         (more intense)
               I finished reading this.  It gets real
               crazy towards the end, after all the
               death stuff.  But then she said some-
               thing really freaky - about her mother
               taking her down to the basement to 
               show her the glove.

     ON LISA

     She's totally sucked in to the story, wide-eyes and waiting for 
     more.  She offers a french fry to Jesse.  He shakes his head.  She 
     pops it into her mouth and nods for Jesse to go on.

                              JESSE
               That's when she started talking about
               Fred Krueger.

                              LISA
               Who?

                              JESSE
               Fred Krueger.  The guy in her dream 
               who's coming to kill her.  Seems he 
               was a real guy, ten years before who
               went around kidnapping kids and 
               killing them.

     ON LISA

     She emits a long, windy whistle.

     INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

     KIDS are at their lockers, taking off their jackets and getting 
     together everything they'll need for the day.

     ON JESSE AND LISA

     As they walk down the hall together.

                              LISA
               Maybe you were having a premonition or
               something.  You know, like those guys
               who help the police solve crimes and 
               find missing people.  You ever had 
               anything like this happen before?

     Jesse thinks about it.

                              JESSE
                         (finally)
               No. Never.
                         (a beat)
               You think that's what it is?

                              LISA
                         (thoughtfully)
               I don't know.

     They stop in the middle of the corridor.

                              LISA
               Can I look at that diary for a little
               while?

     Jesse raises his eyebrows vaguely, reaches in his bag and hands 
     over the book.

                              LISA
                         (taking it)
               Thanks.

     Before she can go on, they are interrupted by a squeaky voice to 
     their side.  At the sound of it, Lisa displays annoyed 
     recognition.

                              KERRY (O.C.)
               Hi, guys.

     LONGER ANGLE:

                              LISA
               Hi, Kerry.

                              KERRY
                         (to Lisa)
               I got your invitation yesterday.  
               Thanks.
                         (a beat)
               Any cute guys gonna be there?

                              LISA
                         (tired sigh)
               All of them.

                              KERRY
               Yor dad picking the music again?

                              LISA
                         (smiles)
               Mom's trying to keep him upstairs.

     Jesse looks at Lisa quizzically.

                              LISA
                         (to Jesse)
               Last party I had, Dad insisted on 
               playing nothing but Benny Goodman
               records all night.

     The class bell RINGS.

     Lisa leans over and kisses Jesse.

                              LISA
               I'll see you later, okay?

     The kiss takes him by surprise as she walks off with Kerry.

                              JESSE
                         (calling after her)
               I may be late.  Baseball practice!

     EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

     The school TEAM has been split up into two sides.  There's an air 
     of excitement about - like it's a close game, drawing to an end.

     GRADY is on third, waiting to be hit home.

     The PITCHER winds and throws.

     ON THE BATTER

     A swing and a miss.  SCHNEIDER calls him out.

     He tosses the bat aside, disgustedly.

     JESSE is on deck.  As he approaches the plate:

                              A TEAMATE (O.C.)
               Last out.  Up to you, Walsh.

     ON GRADY

     He sneers like they might as well just concede the game now and go 
     home early.

     The PITCHER sends one right down the middle.

     JESSE lets it go and Schneider calls a strike.

     He chokes up a bit on the bat and takes his stance.

     Another perfect pitch and Jesse lets it go again.

                              SCHNEIDER
               Strike!

     Grady slaps himself in the face and shakes his head pitifully.

     The PITCHER throws another.

     This time, Jese catches it perfectly, SLAMMING it down the middle 
     for a solid hit.

     GRADY scores amid cheers and slaps on the back.  JESSE holds up at 
     first.

     INT. BOY'S LOCKER ROOM - DAY

     JESSE is at the end of a row of lockers.  He pulls off his shirt 
     and tosses it in the locker, takes down a towel and sets it down 
     on the bench next to him.

     Several BOYS pass by on their way to their lockers or the showers, 
     giving Jesse the thumbs-up.

                              BOYS
               Good game, Walsh...Way to go, Walsh
               ...etc.

     GRADY approaches and goes to his own locker, down a few from 
     Jesse's.

     Jesse plops down on the bench and slowly pulls off his sneakers.  
     He stops to rub his aching shoulders.

                              GRADY
                         (finally)
               You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.

                              JESSE
               It was okay.

                              GRADY
               Who told you to choke up that way?

                              JESSE
               My Dad.  He played in the minors for
               a while, when he got out of college.

                              GRADY
                         (impressed)
               No shit.

     They continue undressing in silence.  As Jesse speaks, COACH 
     SCHNEIDER steps up behind them.

                              JESSE
               Schneider shouldn't have called you
               out on that double.

                              GRADY
               Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick
               up his ass today.

                              JESSE
                         (laughs)
               Schneider's always got a stick up
               his ass.

     Schneider smiles wickedly as he places his hands on the two boys' 
     shoulders.

     EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY

     JESSE and GRADY trudge along at somewhere between a job and a 
     stumble.  They talk to each other with words that are punctuated 
     by huffs, puffs and side-stitches.

                              JESSE
                         (cautiously)
               You remember your dreams, Grady?

                              GRADY
               Only the wet ones.

     Jesse shoots him a condescending sneer and decides not to pursue 
     it.

     EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

     The lot is practically empty with most of the students on heir way 
     home by now.  Jesse's car is parked in the center.

     LISA is leaning on the car, waiting with a stack of books at her 
     side.  She looks up as Jesse approaches.

                              JESSE
               Sorry.  Schneider id it to me again.

                              LISA
               I just got here myself.  Went to the
               Public Library.
                         (proudly)
               Cut four classes!

     He opens the door for her.  She picks up the books and climbs in.  
     Jesse runs around to the other side and slides in beside her.

                              JESSE
                         (indicating the books)
               What's all this.

                              LISA
               Research.
                         (she kisses him)
               Hi.
                         (an intriguing wink)
               C'mon, let's go for a ride.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

     The blue Falcon rolls down the highway.

     INSIDE

     JESSE is driving as LISA re-stacks some of the books on her lap 
     and begins leafing through one.

                              LISA
               I'm convinced you've had a genuine
               psychic vision.

     Jesse looks over at her inquisitively.

                              LISA
               At first I wasn't sure because you
               said that you never had anyting like 
               last night happen before.  But I 
               found out that most people have the
               potential for tuning in to "the 
               other world" and neve do.  It has
               something to do with the environment 
               - like they have to be in a place 
               that's sending signals.

                              JESSE
               Like a haunted house, right?  I don't
               believe in ghosts.

                              LISA
               You don't have to.  You just have to
               believe in energy.

     She shifts in her seat to face him.

                              LISA
                         (intensely)
               Look, you got electricity in your
               body, right?

                              JESSE
               Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...

                              LISA
               And heat and chemical reactions.
               Where does it all go when you die?

                              JESSE
               I don't know - into the air I
               suppose.

                              LISA
                         (pointing up ahead)
               Make a left at this corner.

     Jesse turns at the intersection.

                              LISA
               What about "essential energy" the 
               soul.  Does that go into the air
               too?  You think there's a good 
               energy and a bab energy?

                              JESSE
                         (confussed)
               I don't know.
                         (a beat)
               Where are we going?

                              LISA
                         (smiles mysteriously)
               It's a surprise.

     EXT. ABANDONED POWER PLANT - DAY

     An old generating plant, big enough to have served what was once a 
     small town but rundown and obsolete now.  the place is charred and 
     the grounds are littered with rubble - as if there'd been a fire 
     there long ago.

     The entrance to the plant is boarded up and plastered with "NO 
     TRESPASSING" signs.  Many of the boards are missing, providing 
     easy access for the scores of vandals who had torn through there 
     at one time or another.

     There are no windows at ground level but the top of the building 
     is lined with many multi-paned frames; all of them are either 
     cracked or missing.

     JESSE'S CAR pulls into frame and he and LISA get out and look the 
     place over.

                              JESSE
               What is this place?

                              LISA
                         (excidedly)
               Remember in the diary - Nancy said
               that she kept finding herself in 
               a boiler room?  Fred Krueger
               worked here.  It's an old power-
               plant - a steam generator!

     She pulls out several papers and hands them to Jesse.

                              LISA
               Here.

                              JESSE
               What's this?

     ON THE PAPERS

     Xeroxes of newspaper articles.

     The HEADLINE reads:  "SPRINGWOOD SLASHER ARRESTED!"

                              LISA (O.C.)
               I did some reading up on our friend,
               Fred Krueger.

     Jesse leafs through the papers.  Each one is a front page from a 
     local newspaper.

     HEADLINE: "KRUEGER FREED ON TECHNICALITY!  D.A. RESIGNS"

     HEADLINE: "JUSTICE DONE - KRUEGER KILLED BY MOB!  SPRINGWOOD
               SLASHER DIES IN HELLISH INFERNO"

     Jesse sucks in his breath.

     INT. ENTRANCEWAY, ABANDONED POWERPLANT - DAY

     Jesse and Lisa climb between a pair of boards and step inside.

     ON LISA

     She walks toward the center of the plant, fascinated.

     INT. POWERPLANT

     We can see the remnants of a large boiler room.  Big steel pipes 
     jut out of the floor in a tangle of elbows and valves and a 
     clutter of debris.  A one-story holdig tank rises above a concrete 
     pit and is met on top by a mze of catwalks, just under the 
     windows.

     Although most of the ceiling has burned away, the interior is 
     surprisingly intact for a derelict building and the overhead light 
     distracts form any intrinsic creepiness the place would possess 
     after dark.

     Jesse steps in behind her.

                              LISA
                         (solemnly)
               He kidnapped twenty kids and brought
               them all here to die.

     She gives herself a chill but shakes it off and turns to Jesse.

                              LISA
               So, you feeling anything?

                              JESSE
               What do you mean?

                              LISA
               I thought you might be able to make
               a connection.

     Jesse shrugs his shoulders and puts his hands to the side of his 
     mouth.

                              JESSE
                         (calling)
               Any ghosts in here?

                              LISA
               C'mon, cut it out.

                              JESSE
               Well, what am I supposed to do?

                              LISA
               I don't know.  Concentrate or some-
               thing.

     Jesse shifts his legs and stares up at the ceiling.  He closes his 
     eyes.

                              JESSE
                         (still concentrating)
               I feel like a jerk.

                              LISA
               Shhh.  Just concentrate.

     Jesse walks around in a small circle, keeping hsi head up and his 
     eyes closed.

                              LISA
               Anything?

                              JESSE
                         (shakes his head)
               Uh-uh.
                         (a beat)
               Wait...

     He walks slowly across the room, almost in a trance, until he 
     comes to a board leaning up against the foot of the mesh-iron 
     stairway that leads up to the catwalks.

     ON THE BOARD

     As his hand reaches over to touch it.

     ON LISA

     stepping over next to Jesse.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     He pulls the board away.

     A LARGE RAT, in her nest, WITH HER YOUNG, SNARLS at him.

     Jesse and Lisa jump into each other's arms.

     EXT. ABANDONED POWERPLANT - LATE AFTERNOON

     JESSE and LISA walk along the outskirts of the building to a 
     pretty cluster of shade trees nearby.  Lisa hoists herself up on a 
     boulder and looks at the building.

                              JESSE
               Disappointed?

                              LISA
               About what?

                              JESSE
               About not finding any bogey men?

                              LISA
                         (smiles)
               I'll get over it.

     She is disappointed - She wanted to find some bogey men.

     Jesse comes up close to her and they stare at each other.

                              LISA
                         (finally)
               You are sensitive.  I mean you sensed
               that the rat was there.  And I can
               feel something about you.  Sometimes
               I feel like I know what you're thinking.

     Jesse moves in closer an puts his arms on her shoulders.

                              JESSE
                         (suggestively)
               Yeah?

                              LISA
                         (ignoring the 
                          suggestion)
               Maybe it only happens when you're
               sleeping - that's the way it was with
               Nancy, wasn't it?

                              JESSE
               Now, there's an idea we can take off 
               on.  Maybe we should drive out to the
               beach tonight and lay out a couple
               of blankets and...
                         (winks)
               Until I fall asleep.

                              LISA
                         (slyly)
               Maybe we can do that.  Strictly 
               scientific, of course.

     Jesse moves in until their lips are almost touching.

                              JESSE
               Nancy went bonkers from this thing.
               You wouldn't be afraid of being out
               on the beach with a potential 
               lunatic?

                              LISA
               Ghostbusters are fearless.

     They kiss.  Not little friendly pecks like before -- this is the 
     real thing.  Jesse drops his arms to her waist and she opens her 
     legs so that he can get in real close.

     Suddenly, Jesse groans in pain and stands upright, tearing from 
     their embrace.  For the briefest instant, we can see protrusions 
     grow and subside on his forehead and the side of his face.

                              LISA
               What is it - What's wrong?

                              JESSE
                         (holding his stomach)
               Whoa!

                              LISA
               What is it?

                              JESSE
               I don't know - a sharp pain.

     Lisa watches his helplessly.  Finally, the agony lifts from 
     Jesse's face.  He straightens up.

                              JESSE
               It's gone now.

                              LISA
               Oh, Jesse...

     Lisa puts her arms around him.

                              LISA
               Jesse, this is no good.  You've got
               to get some sleep, Jesse.  You've 
               got to get some sleep.

     INT. WALSH HOUSE - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Jesse is in bed, tossing restlessly adn panting heavily.  He is 
     drenched with sweat and continues to perspire profusely as he sits 
     up and turns on his bedside lamp.

     A thunderhead is RUMBLING somewhere nearby.

     The PLASTIC SHADE OF THE LAMP is melting.

     He scans the room picking out various indications of the intense 
     heat that is surrounding him; A CANDLE on his bookshelf collapses 
     into a puddle of wax, the LAMINATED TOP OF THE NIGHT-TABLE is 
     bubbling, an UNSHEATHED RECORD ALBUM hangs over the corner of the 
     desk, his PORTABLE STEREO has caved in the center - a Daliesque 
     tableau.

     SOUND OVER: SCRAPING

     Jesse gets out of bed, crossing to the desk.  The scraping sound 
     intensifes.

     CLOSE ON THE DRAWER

     as Jesse opens it.  Inside, THE GLOVE, fingers moving, 
     independently, unattached, scraping little cuts in the bottom of 
     the drawer.

     ON JESSE

     slamming the drawer shut.

     SOUND OVER: A SWISHING SOUND, FOLLOWED BY A THUMP, AGAIN AND AGAIN

     UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

     JESSE, barefoot and wearing only a pair of jeans and an unbuttoned 
     shirt, steps up to the door to Angela's room.  The sound is coming 
     from inside.  He opens the door.

     ANGELA is standing in the middle of the floor, in her nightgown, 
     seemingly oblivious to the heat.  She is jumping rope and 
     chanting:

                              ANGELA
               One, two, Freddy's coming for you.

     ON JESSE, PETRIFIED

                              ANGELA (O.C.)
               Three, four, better lock your door.

     ON ANGELA

     She sees her brother staring at her.  She doesn't stop jumping but 
     smiles and continues her jingle:

                              ANGELA
               Five, six, grab your crucifix...

     Jesse SLAMS the door shut.

     KITCHEN

     Jesse enters, looks out the windows.  A huge bolt of LIGHTNING 
     RIPS through the night sky; a multiple flash f blue light strobes 
     through the kitchen followed by a CRACK of intense THUNDER.

     ANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHTNING cuts across the kitchen itself, 
     SHATTERING SOME DISHES on the counter-top, leaving a plume of 
     BLACK SMOKE.

     EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT

     The rain continues to come down in buckets.  Jesse enters shot and 
     walks, unprotected in his drenched jeans and shirt and seemingly 
     without any knowledge of where he is going.

     The streets are totally empty.

     EXT. DON'S PLACE - NIGHT

     A seedy tavern on a badly lit corner.

     JESSE steps into frame.

     He stares at the place before stepping up to he door.

     INT. DON'S PLACE - NIGHT

     The toughest looking bar in the entire city.  The place is packed 
     with PROSTITUTES, PIMPS, TRAVELING SALESMEN, a couple of 
     TRANSVESTITES and a generous delegation of the leather and chain 
     contingency.

     Jesse enters and crosses to the bar amid a few stares.  He sits on 
     a stool.

     The bartender draws a cold beer and presents it to Jesse.  As the 
     bartender turns away, Jesse reaches for the glass.

     A HAND slaps down on his wrist and holds it tightly.

     He looks up.

     COACH SCHNEIDER is standing over him.  He's wearing a muscle 
     shirt, a gold chain around his neck and he has a sick grin on his 
     face.

     INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

     JESSE is barefoot, jogging arund the outer edge of the gym floor 
     and looking as if he's about to collapse from exhaustion.

     ON SCHNEIDER

     Leaning against a wall of the gym, watching Jesse run.

     As Jesse comes around for another lap, Schneider reaches out and 
     grabs him, throwing him into a wall of folding wooden bleachers.  
     Jesse is dazed, ready to drop.

                              SCHNEIDER
                         (barking)
               Hit the showers.

     INT. BOYS LOCKER ROOM - SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT

     Jesse turns on one of the faucets and lets the hot water hit him 
     full on.

     INT. COACH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     SCNEIDER turns to a huge, padlocked cabinet on the wall.

     He unlocks it and opens the doors.  It is filled with a variety of 
     athletic equipment:  dumbbells, jump-ropes and volley balls, etc.

     Schneider selects a pair of jump-ropes from the cabinet and sets 
     them down on his desk.

     A distinct PING makes him look up.  He goes to the door and looks 
     out into the hall.

     SHOWER ROOM

     Jesse continues showering.

     INT. COACH'S OFFICE

     Schneider turns back to his office.  There is ANOTHER PING.

     A TENNIS RACQUET hanging on the wall has two broken strings.  TWO 
     MORE STRINGS SMOKE, THEN SNAP with a ping.

     A BASKETBALL leaps off a shelf of the equipmnt cabinet and bounce 
     on the floor at Schneider's feet.

     Schneider bends down to pick it up and TWO MORE BALLS jump out 
     onto the floor.

     A FOURTH BALL flies out and knocks over a TROPHY on his desk.

     Schneider hits the deck when a DUMBBELL streaks across the office 
     and SLAMS into the window, cracking the thick wired glass.

     ON SCHNEIDER

     he makes his way to the cabinet by crawling along the floor as 
     BASKETBALLS, VOLLEYBALLS, even a MEDICINE BALL fly over his head.

     He reaches up to close the cabinet doors.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     A JUMP-ROPE on the desk unravels like a harpoon line and wraps an 
     end of itself around Schneider's wrist.  The other end pulls hard 
     and yanks Schneider off balance.

     He reaches up to close the cabinet doors.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     A JUMP-ROPE on the desk unravels like a harpoon line and wraps an 
     end of itself around Schneider's wrist.  The other end pulls hard 
     and yanks Schneider off balance.

     As he reaches with his free arm to unwrap his wrist, the SECOND 
     ROPE rockets off the desk top and secures itself to his other 
     wrist.

     hThe office door opens by itself.  The ropes drag Schneider 
     screaming from the room.

     SHOWER ROOM

     JESSE turns as the shower head next to the one he is using, 
     gurgles and suddenly comes on full.  And suddenly, all the showers 
     are on, spewing water and steam.

     We hear Schneider's screams as he is dragged into the room, 
     through great puddles of water and against the tiled wall opposite 
     Jesse.  The showers on this side are OFF.

     The boy watches in horror as the ropes shoot up to two adjacent 
     shower nozzles and hoist the Coach into a helpless spread-eagle, 
     facing the wall.  His clothes shear from his body like sheets of 
     tissue paper.

     A STACK OF TOWELS

     Comes to life, snapping in mid-air at Schneider's butt and back.  
     As they hit him, they draw blood.

     ON JESSE

     as the room fills with great clouds of steam until he is nearly 
     obscured; just a dark human form in the corner of the shower room.

     ANOTHER ANGLE ON SCHNEIDER

     as a figure in a green and red sweater and a battered fedora, cuts 
     through the clouds, CACKLING and throwing his weapon-arm back like 
     a World Series pitcher about to lob a fast ball.

     Schneider screams painfully as the knives cut four long tears in 
     him, starting at the top of his naked back, cutting through his 
     flesh.

     The weapon arm STRIKES AGAIN.  Schneider screams, goes limp.

     WIDE-ANGLE: SCHNEIDER

     BLOOD begins to flow out of all the shower heads on Schneider's 
     side.  Schneider hangs limply from the shower heads.

     ON THE MURDERER

     CAMERA DOLLIES IN FAST to reveal it is JESSE.  He screams.

     Jesse lifts his hand into frame.  He is wearing Freddy's bloodied 
     glove.

                              JESSE
               No...Oh God, no...

     He slowly drops to his knees, sloshing in a crimson puddle, and 
     stares up to the heavens.

                              JESSE
                         (screaming)
               No!!!

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

     INT. WALSH HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

     We hear the DOORBELL RINGING repeatedly until the lights flick on 
     and DAD hurries to the door, wrapping a robe over his pajamas.

     HIS POV AS HE OPENS THE DOOR

     TWO POLICEMEN in rain slickers stand on either side of Jesse.  he 
     is naked but is wrapped in a blanket.  His hair is soaked and 
     dripping over his face.

                              1st POLICEMAN
               This belong to you?

     Dad can't believe what he's looking at.  He just nods his head.

     The 2nd Policeman gives Jesse a slight push across the threshold.  
     He stumbles into the house.

                              1st POLICEMAN
               We found him wandering out on the Highway, 
               naked.  Keep a leash on him, will ya?

                                                       CUT TO:

     KITCHEN - A TEA KETTLE WHISTLING

     MOM takes the kettle from the stove and pours it into a mug.  She 
     steeps the teabag as she crosses to the table and

     JESSE

     Wide awake, holding the blanket tightly around his neck, takes the 
     cup from his mother.

     DAD paces the floor angrily.

                              DAD
               Okay, we're gonna put our cards on the
               table, here and now.  There's not going
               to be any retribution - no fire and 
               brimstone.  I only have two questions
               and you'll answer them and we'll all go
               to bed, okay?

     Jesse nods weakly.

                              DAD
               Okay. What are you taking and who are
               you getting it from?

     Jesse snorts and shakes his head ironically.

                              JESSE
               I'm not taking drugs, Dad.
                         (to Mom)
               Can I go to bed now?

                              MOM
                         (touches his cheek
                          tenderly)
               Sure...go ahead.

     Dad tries to burn a hole through him with his eyes as Jesse gets 
     up from the table and leaves the room.

     As the double-hinged doors slap clsoed behind him, Dad turns to 
     Mom without a change of expression.

                              DAD
                         (no question about it)
               He's on something.

     EXT. WALSH HOUSE - MORNING

     DAD is standing on a ladder, unbolting a set of security bars from 
     the windows.

     He watches from above as JESSE runs out the door, followed by MOM.

                              MOM
               Jesse, please, let's talk about this!

                              JESSE
                         (pleading)
               I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.

     Jesse walks over to his car and climbs in.

     Mom turns to Dad who is watching the scene curiously.

                              MOM
               He needs professional help.  I think
               we should take him to a psychiatrist.

                              DAD
                         (incensed)
               Are you nuts or something?  What
               the hell is that going to do?

                              MOM
               I don't know!  I just know he needs
               help and we don't know how to give
               it to him.

     Dad shifts on the ladder and begins to protest.

                              MOM
                         (squelching it)
               Don't fight me on this.

     She stomps back toward the house.

                              DAD
                         (calling after her)
               He needs a kick in the but, is what
               he needs.  He needs a methodone 
               clinic!

     She throws back a dirty look.

                              MOM
               Oh, blow it out your ass, Ken.

     With that, Dad loses his footing on the ladder and drops down 
     several rungs.

     EXT. ROAD - DAY

     Jesse's car travels slowly and turns onto a tree-lined street.

     INSIDE

     JESSE drives silently with LISA looking over at him, upset.

                              LISA
                         (upset)
               Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?

                              JESSE
                         (staring straight ahead)
               I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.

                              LISA
                         (undeterred)
               you didn't say more than two words to
               me the whole way here.  You had another
               nightmare, didn't you?

                              JESSE
               yeah, I had a bad night.

                              LISA
               You want to talk about it?

                              JESSE
               My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom
               thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I
               don't agree with her.

     EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

     as Jesse's car pulls into the lot.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     as they turn a corner.  Jesse jams on the brakes.

     THEIR POV - THE GYMNASIUM WING

     in the distance.  A crowd of STUDENTS is gathered in a ring about 
     three-deep outside the doors leading to the practice fields.

     IN THE CAR

                              JESSE
               Oh God.

     He throws open the door, jumps out and runs toward the crowd.

     Bewildered, Lisa does likewise, running after him.

     As they get closer, they can see that the entire area is cordoned 
     of with red plastic ribbons.

     SEVERAL POLICEMEN and OFFICIALS are coming in and out of the 
     building.

     A TEACHER is trying to disperse the students, clapping his hands 
     together and pushing through the rubber-neckers.

                              TEACHER
               Okay gang, let's move along.

     Jesse stops at the edge of the barricade cranes his neck to see 
     what's going on.

     GRADY spots Jesse and runs over to his side.  Jesse is turning 
     white as he watches the scene and listens to Grady's recap:

                              GRADY
               Holy shit, man.  Where have you been?
               Fuckin' Schneider got wasted last night.

     Jesse swallows hard to regain his composure.  Lisa arrives at his 
     side.

                              JESSE
               Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.

                              GRADY
                         (ignores him)
               He must've been working late and some
               fruitcake came in and sliced him up
               like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left
               bloody footprints all over the...

     Jesse clamps his hand over his mouth and breaks for some bushes 
     against the building.

     Grady looks at a horrified Lisa and gives a puzzled shrug.

     INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY

     ON THE FOOD LINE

     LISA and KERRY are on the lunch line, sliding their trays along 
     the rails.  Kerry is wearing a walkman with the volume truned way 
     up - we can almost make out the song.

                              KERRY
               That was something this morning, huh?
               About Schneider, I mean.

     Lisa nods and takes a plate of macaroni and cheese from one of the 
     KITCHEN STAFF.  She doesn't want to talk about it.

                              KERRY
               Jesse sure took it bad, didn't he?

     Lisa shrugs and moves her tray away from Kerry's, toward the 
     CASHIER.

     Kerry picks up a piece of cake from a shelf and slides ehr tray 
     down until she's next to Lisa again.

     IN THE DINING ROOM

     JESSE is sitting at a table, a tray of food in front of him, 
     untouched.

     He glances up at GRADY as he sits down next to him and starts 
     digging in.


                              GRADY
                         (with his mouth full)
               Look, I'm sorry about Schneider, man.
               I didn't know you were so close.

     Jesse doesn't qualify that with a response.

                              GRADY
               You want to go out to a movie or something
               tonight?  Get your mind off things?

     Jesse shakes his head.

     Lisa comes over to the table with her tray and sits down next to 
     Jesse.

     Kerry follows and sits next to Grady.

                              KERRY
               Hi, guys.
                         (to Grady, 
                          coquettishly)
               Hi, Ronny.  You going to Lisa's party
               tomorrow night?

                              GRADY
                         (without looking up
                          from his food)
               I can't.  I'm grounded.

                              KERRY     
               How come?

                              GRADY
               For throwin' my grandmother down a
               flight of stairs.

     Kerry, taking him seriously, nods gravely.

     Lisa looks at Jesse's tray of untouched food.

                              LISA
                         (to Jesse)
               You should eat something - you'll feel
               better.

                              JESSE
               I'm not hungry.

                              LISA
               I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure
               it out, you know.  We can figure it out
               together.

                              JESSE
               There's nothing to figure out.

                              GRADY
                         (to Lisa, disgustedly)
               You're wasting your time, the guy's a
               basket case.

                              JESSE
               Shut up, Grady.

     Grady pushes his tray aside.

                              GRADY
               You want me to shut up?  Fine, I'll 
               shut up, that's fine.  See you around,
               buddy.

     Grady gets up and storms away from the table.

     Lisa, deeply pained, looks at Jesse.  Jesse avoids her stare until 
     he just drops his head into his hands and tries not to cry in 
     front of his friends.

     He composes himself quickly and digs his fork into his lunch, 
     choking down some macaroni.

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     LISA, her MOTHER and FATHER are sitting, eating dinner.  Lisa's 
     mind is not at the table with her.

                              MRS. POLETTI
                         (to Lisa)
               Bought some nice strawberries at the 
               farm today.  We can have some short
               cake for your friends tomorrow.

     Lisa looks up an dsmiles blandly.

                              MRS. POLETTI
               I also wangled a promise out of your
               father.

     ON MR. POLETTI

     He scowls slightly.

                              LISA
                         (politely)
               What's that?

                              MRS. POLETTI
               We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow
               night.

                              LISA
               You're going out?

                              MRS. POLETTI
               We're going to bed.

     She looks at her husband.

                              MRS. POLETTI
               Early.

     EXT. WALSH HOUSE - NIGHT

     Quiet.  The lights inside are all out.

     INT. WALSH HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

     We hear FOOTSTEPS and we TRAVEL with the sound along the floor to 
     the foot of the basement steps.

     INTRUDER'S POV

     as he climbs the steps and approaches the door to the main part of 
     the house.

     THE CAMERA is moving faster now, leaping the top steps and 
     CRASHING through the doorway and onto the foyer floor.

     It crosses the FOYER adn begins climbing the stairs to the bedroom 
     level.  It stops at Angela's room and opens the door.

     ANGELA sleeps soundly, peacefully.

     It crosses over to the bed, a menacing SHADOW creeps over her 
     form.  The taloned glove pulls down on the blankets and she shifts 
     position in the center of the bed, innocent and vulnerable.

     We see the SHADOW of the intruder on the wall...it moves in close 
     to the sleeping child and emits a guttural, inhuman VOICE:

                              INTRUDER (O.C.)
               Wake up, little girl...

     Her eyes flutter open.  She looks up at the intruder and smiles.

                              ANGELA
                         (sleepily)
               What time is it?

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     We now see that it's JESSE standing over her.  he's in his 
     underpants, drenched with sweat and hunched over as if all the 
     muscles in his body were twisted around each other.

     The sound of Angela's voice softens him.  He slowly straghtens up 
     and looks about the room as if wondering how he got there.

                              JESSE
                         (himself again)
               It's late...go back to sleep.

     She nods and closes her eyes.

     Jesse starts to pull the covers back over her and stops suddenly.

     HIS POV

     His right hand is wearing the GLOVE.

     INT. WALSH HOUSE - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     The desk lamp and a late movie on the T.V. are the only sources of 
     light in the room.

     We see that the bed is rumpled and empty and we PAN across the 
     room, to JESSE, sitting on the floor in front of the door, knees 
     up against his chest, trying with all his strength to stay awake.  
     He has a mug of black coffee in his hand and a pot of java at his 
     side.

     He tops off his cup and reaches into the breast pocket of his 
     shirt, withdrawing a small vial of pills.

     A BOTTLE OF NO-DOZ

     He rips the cap off with his teeth and dumps half the bottle into 
     his coffee.

     EXT. WALSH HOUSE - MORNING

     A dark, dreary day.  There are no morning sounds except for the 
     SQUEAKING of an old rattle-trap bicycle as an overweight PAPER BOY 
     swings by and lobs the morning edition over the lawn.

     The paper skids off the front steps and into the garden.

     INT. WALSH HOUSE - FOYER - MORNING

     JESSE walks down the steps.  He looks ragged and exhausted and 
     worse that ever.

     OUTSIDE THE KITCHEN

     He stops before going through the double-hinged door to push his 
     hair back and forces a well rested, easy-going guise.

     IN THE KITCHEN

     DAD and ANGELA are sitting at the table.  MOM is pouring some 
     coffee into a couple of cups.

     JESSE enters.

                              JESSE
               Morning.

                              MOM
               How'd you sleep, honey, okay?

                              JESSE
               Fine.

     Mom gives him a quick glance.

                              MOM
               You're looking a little better today.

     DAD looks at Jesse's pale skin, the light stubble on his chin and 
     his dark, bloodshot eyes and turns to Mom as if she's nuts.

     EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

     The entire pool area has been done up to the max.  Japanese 
     lanterns have been strung up above the fence, a long table, 
     covered with festively arranged salads and condiments, stretches 
     across the patio in front of the sliders and a Benny Goodman dance 
     tune is blaring through some outdoor speakers.  An all-too-bright 
     underwater light makes the blue water shimmer crystal-clear.

     A score of nubile GIRLS in scanty swimsuits and athletic GUYS in 
     cut-offs and trunks, scamper around, eating, swimming and horsing 
     around.

     ON MR. POLETTI

     Standing over the gas grill, wearing a "Kiss the Cook" chefs hat 
     and apron, cooking up a mess of hanburgers and hot dogs.

     ON MRS. POLETTI AND LISA

     stepping out of the house through the sliders, carrying more 
     plates of food outside.

     A BOY

     bounces once on the diving board and CANNONBALLS into the center 
     of the pool, SPLASHING everything within a fifteen foot radius 
     including,

     MR. POLETTI

     who spins around from the grill, annoyed.

                              MR. POLETTI
               Hey, watch it there!

     LISA turns to her mother, mortified.

     Mrs. Poletti hands her the platter she is holding and gives Lisa a 
     reassuring squeeze on the shoulder before leaving her side and 
     crossing toward her husband.

     Lisa turns her attention to JESSE, at the far corner of the patio, 
     sitting in a lounger, alone.  He looks worried and detached.

     She looks back toward the grill.

     MRS. POLETTI is pulling her husband away, against his will.  He 
     finally relents and beckons a BOY over.  He turns his spatula over 
     to him, surrenders his chef's hat and allows Lisa's mom to escort 
     him back toward the house.

     JESSE, LISA'S POV

     He finally gets up and crosses toward the cabanas, going inside 
     and shutting the door.

     BACK TO LISA

     as her mother and father approach.

                              MRS. POLETTI
               We're going up to bed now.

                              LISA
                         (gratefully)
               Thanks, Mom.

     Mr. Poletti clearly doesn't like this arrangement.  He looks 
     behind him at all the horny young boys and turns back to Lisa.

                              MR. POLETTI
                         (sternly)
               Twelve-thiry, Miss.  No later.

                              LISA
                         (nods agreeably)
               Twelve-thirty.  I promise.

     Mrs. Poletti takes her husband by the arm again and leads him up 
     to the sliders.  He turns around before going through.

                              MR. POLETTI
               And don't forget to lock the gate.

                              LISA
                         (nods)
               Goodnight, Daddy.

     Mr. Poletti is half-led, half-pushed through the doorway.  mrs. 
     Poletti pulls the slider closed behind them.

     INT. CABANA - NIGHT

     A roomy dressing area with an open shower stall at the back.  
     There's a wide, wooden bench along one wall, covered with clothing 
     and towels.

     JESSE stands in the center of the room, putting his pants on.  He 
     is shirtless and shoeless.

     SOUND OVER:  A KNOCK ON THE DOOR

                              LISA (O.S.)
               Jesse?

     Jesse hesitates, uncomfortable.

                              JESSE
               Be out in a minute.

     EXT. CABANA

     Lisa waits for Jesse.  Finally, he unlatches the door.  his shirt 
     is on, unbuttoned.  Lisa steps into the cabana.

     INT. CABANA

     Lisa shuts the door behind her.  The two look at each other a 
     moment.  Then Jesse looks away and continues buttoning his shirt.

                              JESSE
               I think I better go.  I'm just not into
               it tonight.  I'm sorry.

                              LISA
               Why won't you talk to me?

                              JESSE
               Will you leave me alone?  Please.

     Jesse crosses to the bench and sits to put on his shoes.

                              LISA
               You're not being fair to me.  I'm 
               worried about you and I want to 
               help you get through this thing.

                              JESSE
               What are you gonna do?  How are you 
               gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.
                         (breaking down)
               I don't want to have you watch me fall
               apart.

     Lisa goes to Jesse.  She puts a comforting arm on his shoulder.

                              LISA
               It's okay, Jesse.

     Jesse takes her hand and holds it tight.  She sits beside him.

                              JESSE
                         (choked)
               I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to 
               stay awake - I'm ruining your party. 
               They're gonna put me away for sure.

                              LISA
               We'll figure it out together.  We'll 
               stay up all night if we have to.  I
               won't let anything happen to you.

     They look into each others eyes.  Lisa kisses him ever so gently, 
     then again.  he kisses her.  Their kisses grow hungrier.

     Love conquers fear and they embrace fully, kissing passionately.

     POOLSIDE

     THREE BOYS are huddled together, looking up at the Poletti's 
     bedroom window.

                              BOY ONE
               Any second, now...

     THE BEDROOM WINDOW, THEIR POV

     The lights FLICK OUT.

                              BOY ONE (O.C.)
                         (quietly)
               Party time.

     ON THE WET BAR

     Someone reaches over to the stereo, pops out the Benny Goodman 
     cassette and flicks the radio on.  Van Halen BLASTS out of the 
     speakers.

     ON KERRY

     In the pool, up to her neck with a HUNK.  They both look up as the 
     music changes.  The top of her bathing suit floats up to the 
     surface.

                              KERRY
               Oh, wow, Van Halen.

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - THE POLETTI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     At the sound of the music, Mr. Poletti sits up in bed, angrily.

     Mrs. Poletti puts an arm on his shoulder.

                              MRS. POLETTI
                         (quietly)
               Let them have their fun, Honey.

     Mrs. poletti pulls out a pair of earplugs and hands them to Mr. 
     Poletti, who grumbles, sticks them in his ear and drops back down 
     into his pillow.

     EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

     Somebody switches off the lights to general applause.

     BACK TO KERRY AND THE HUNK

     They are in a steamy embrace when the underwater lights go out.

     The rest of her suit pops up out of the water.

     ON SOME BUSHES

     as a COUPLE pulls out a red wagon, stashed in the shrubbery and 
     loaded with beer.

     INT. CABANA - NIGHT

     JESSE and LISA rolling around on the floor, a lot of heavy 
     petting; not doing it but serious, heated stuff just the same.

     HIS HAND, wrapped around Lisa's wrist, pinning it gently to the 
     floor.

     ON LISA

     Her eyes closed; feeling him - definitely feeling him.

     CLOSE TWO-SHOT, JESSE

     Jesse is about to take down Lisa's swimsuit top when an ungodly 
     long iridescent serpent-like TONGUE flicks a foot out of his 
     mouth, wiggles and flicks back in.

     Jesse moans lasciviously, not his own voice.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Jesse pushes himself away from Lisa and scrambles to his feet.  
     Lisa, unaware of what happened, is puzzled and upset.

     ON LISA

     sitting up on the floor.

                              LISA
               What's wrong?

     Jesse tucks in his shirt and buttons his pants.  he is visibly 
     shaken.

                              JESSE
               I'll see you.

     Lisa just looks at him, helplessly.

     He slips out the cabana door and shuts it.

     ON LISA

     she gets up slowly.  She's profoundly worried.

     INT. GRADY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Grady is sleeping on his back, dead to the world.

     Suddenly, a hand clamps down over his mouth.

     A light flicks on.

     LONGER ANGLE:  GRADY'S BEDROOM

     It's JESSE.  A window is open in the B.G., teh curtains in 
     disarray.

     He lifts his hand from Grady's mouth and Grady scrambles out of 
     bed.

                              GRADY
                         (hoarsely)
               Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out
               of me!

                              JESSE
               I'm sorry...

                              GRADY
               What are you doing here?

                              JESSE
               You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.

                              GRADY
               Are you nuts or something?

                              JESSE
               Listen to me, Grady, this is serious.
               Something really weird is happening.  It
               started out like just bad dreams but it's
               getting real bad.

     Grady is tired and cranky and he doesn't want ot hear this.

                              GRADY
               Aw, will you get out of here!  Go and
               take a sleeping pill or something...

     He flops back down on his bed and puts his arm over his eyes.

                              GRADY
               In fact, take a whole bottle and do the 
               world a favor.

     Jesse sits on the edge of the bed.

                              JESSE
               I killed Schneider, Grady...

     Grady lifts his arm from his eyes and stares at Jesse 
     preposterously.

                              JESSE
                         (nods)
               Only it wasn't me - I was there but
               it was like something inside of me,
               moving me around.  Then last night 
               it made me go into my sister's room 
               and tonight, with Lisa in the cabana. 
               We were...on the floor - I felt it
               happening again.

     He grabs Grady's arm.

                              JESSE
               It wanted me to kill them, Grady!

     Grady continues his dumbfounded stare.

                              GRADY
                         (finally)
               You're fucked in the head.

                              JESSE
               I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds
               crazy.  But, there's something trying 
               to get into my body.

                              GRADY
                         (sneers)
               The only thing trying to get into your
               body is female and waiting for you on
               a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep
               with me.  Go figure.

                              JESSE
               Look, I don't care if you believe me
               or not...

                              GRADY
               I believe you.  You had some scary
               dreams, okay?

                              JESSE
                         (frustrated)
               No!
                         (shakes his head)
               I don't know - everything's all mixed
               up.
                         (suddenly angry)
               What difference does it make?  I'm in
               trouble here.  I need your help.

     Grady lets that sink in.

                              GRADY
                         (softer)
               Okay, schmuck.  What do you want me 
               to do?

                              JESSE
               Just watch me.  If anything weird 
               happens - like if I start dreaming 
               weird or try to walk out of here, 
               you gotta try to bring me out of it. 
               his me over the head if you have to.
               Just don't let me leave.

     Grady looks down at the floor, sighs, and nods his head.

                              JESSE
               And Grady...

     Grady looks up.

                              JESSE
               Don't fall asleep!

     EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

     The underwater lights are still off, the music has calmed down a 
     bit and most of the KIDS are more into necking than swimming.

     TWO BODIES are rolled up in a blanket together.  From a short 
     SQUEAL, we can deduce that it's KERRY and her HUNK.

     The BAR-B-QUE BOY has remained steadfast at his post although his 
     GIRLFRIEND has joined him and he's paying more attention to her 
     than the hotdogs on the grill.

     ON LISA

     She sitting on one of the lounges, her eyes are red from crying.  
     She's being comforted by a girlfriend, PATTY.

                              PATTY
               Why don't you just call him?

                              LISA
                         (tearfully)
               He won't talk to me.

                              PATTY
               Well, you're not doing him or yourself
               any good sitting here and worrying.

     Lisa looks at her friend.

                              LISA
               I shoud go see him, but...I don't know,
               the party and all...

                              PATTY
                         (encouragingly)
               Go ahead.  I'll hold down the fort.

                              LISA
                         (getting up)
               Thanks, Patty.  You're a pal.

     INT. GRADY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Grady is sitting up in bed, staring at the T.V.  He turns to 
     JESSE, slumped in a nearby chair, asleep.

     Grady switches off the TV with the remote.

                              GRADY
               Sweet dreams, buddy.

     Grady turns off the READING LIGHT by the bed.  He gives a final 
     look at Jesse before he pushes the whole thing out of his mind 
     with a disgusted wave of his arm and lays back down.

     ON JESSE

     Suddenly, his eyes open widely.

                              JESSE
               Grady?

     Grady MUMBLES an obscenity and turns over on his side to face 
     Jesse.

                              GRADY
               What?
     
                              JESSE
               It's happening again.

     Grady turns the reading light back on in time to see Jesse DOUBLE 
     OVER and curl up in obviously incredible pain, falling to his 
     knees.  He flails out as if 1000 volts were going through his body 
     and begins to choke on his tongue.

     Grady scrambles out of bed and dances around Jesse, not knowing 
     what to do.

     ON JESSE'S HAND

     as he raises it and his fingers spread widely apart.

     Four steel RAZOR-KNIVES tear out from withing the tips of Jesse's 
     fingers like long, bloody switchblades!

     GRADY stands by helplessly as Jesse WRITHES.

     And then it is like some crazed beast in Jesse's gut, tearing its 
     way out of his skin like someone stepping through a thick, latex 
     film.

     As his skin peels away, thousands of capillaries pull apart, 
     spraying blood everywhere in a fine, almost powdery mist.

     The transformation is almost complete when FRED KRUEGER's body 
     steps out of the red cloud.  All that is left of Jesse is his 
     SCREAMING FACE, plastered like a grisly ruber mask over Freddy's 
     own disfigured features.

     Grady backs away toward the door.

                              GRADY
                         (screaming)
               No!  No!  No!

     ON FREDDY

     He stands up with an evil smile, all there now, and puts on his 
     battered hat.

     ANGLE: GRADY'S BEDROOM

     Grady tries desperately to get out, but the door won't open.  
     Freddy cackles evilly as he cuts off Grady's screams by grabbing 
     his throat with his unarmed hand.  he pushes Grady up against the 
     door and lifts him off the floor like he was hanging a picture.

     We hear MUFFLED CALLS from outside the door - the off-camera cries 
     of concerned PARENTS.

     THE DOORKNOB RATTLES

     as they try to get in the room to check on their son.

     BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!

     a fist, hammering against the door behind Grady's head - his 
     father trying to get in.

                              MR. GRADY (O.C.)
               What's going on?  Open the door, Ronny!

     FREDDY draws back his knife-hand and prepares to plunge it into 
     Grady's stomach like he was spearing a pot roast.

     OUTSIDE THE DOOR

     MR. and MRS. GRADY, in their nightclothes.  Mrs. Grady stands with 
     her hands over her mouth as Mr. Grady grabs the know again and 
     BANGS his fist repeatedly against teh door.

     ON FREDDY

     Throwing force into his cutting arm.  We CUT before impact to:

     OUTSIDE THE DOOR

     We hear Grady SCREAM as the steel blades cut through his body and 
     poke out through the door like it was made of balsa.  They wiggle 
     slightly to pull free and are retracted with an ungodly SQUEAK.

     Mrs. Grady screams.

                              MR. GRADY
               My God.

     Mr. Grady throws his shoulder with all his might against the door.  
     A second excruciating SCREAM inside, and the knives cut through 
     the door, inches from Mr. Grady's head.  When they pull out, blood 
     is soaking through the knife holes - it looks as if the door 
     itself is bleeding.

     ON GRADY

     breathing his last few gasps.

     ON GRADY'S PARENTS

     They watch in stunned horror.

     ON GRADY

     He sinks slowly to the floor, dead.

     Freddy watches as his victim slides into a heap on the floor.  
     Only we see now that it isn't Freddy anymore but Jesse again, 
     panting exhaustedly and dripping Grady's blood from just under his 
     elbow to the sharp points of the razor-tipped glove he wears on 
     his hand.

     THE DOOR is budging open against Grady's body - a little more with 
     each crash of Mr. Grady's shoulder against the other side.

     Jesse is coming to - himself again, and he views what he has done 
     to his best friend with terror crazed eyes.

     is eye catches his own reflection in a full length mirror on the 
     wall.  The image reflected is of FREDDY.

                              JESSE
               No!
                         (backing away from 
                          the body)
               No!  No!  No!
                         (screaming toward the
                          mirror)
               You son of a bitch!  You killed him!

     Jesse hurls the glove at the mirror, cracking it.  Freddy's 
     mocking image, however, remains.  The last SOUND we hear is a 
     demonic mix of Jesse's own screams and Freddy's cackling laugh.

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

     Lisa has changed into a white shirt and a pair of cut-offs.  She 
     hurries downstairs, buttoning up her shirt and crosses the foyer 
     floor to the door.

     She opens the door and JESSE collapses in her arms.  He is bloody, 
     bruised and his clothes are torn and dirty.

                              LISA
                         (frenzied)
               Jesse, God - what happened?

                              JESSE
                         (hyperventilating)
               I killed him!  I killed him!

     She draws him in close, trying to comfort him.  She looks at his 
     bloody arms.

                              LISA
               Oh, Christ, you're hurt...

                              JESSE
                         (weeping now)
               I killed Grady.  I killed Grady, Lisa.
               I killed Schneider.  Oh my God, he's 
               inside me...

     Lisa looks around, frantically as she holds Jesse tightly against 
     her body.

                              LISA
               Who, Jesse?

                              JESSE
               he's just waiting to take me.  When
               I sleep.

                              LISA
               Who?  Who's doing this to you?

     He looks at her as if she should know.

                              JESSE
               Fred Krueger.
                         (psychotically)
               He's been trying to get hold of me, 
               to use me.  He needs me to get out
               of his world into ours...He's gonna
               take me again.

                              LISA
               No, Jesse.  This isn't happening.
               It's gotta be everything you've 
               taken in -- Schneider and the diary
               and the glove -- only it's all 
               mixed up.

     He pushes away from her, frustrated.

                              JESSE
               No!  Christ, how can I make you 
               understand?  He tried to make me kill
               Angela last night!  Look at the blood
               on my hands!

     He begins to sob.

                              JESSE
               Oh, God.  I did that to Grady...
                         (suddenly coherent,
                          realizing)
               He owns me.

     Lisa puts her arms around him.  SHe strokes his head, trying to 
     calm him.
     
                              LISA
               I'm not gonna let anyone take you from
               me.  There's got to be a reason.  We'll
               figure it out together.

     Suddenly, something makes Lisa stop.

                              LISA
               Wait a minute!

     She leads Jesse toward the study entryway and opens the door.

                              LISA
               Wait in here for me.  I'll be right back.

     Jesse goes into the study.  Lisa hurries off.

     EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

     THE BAR-B-QUE BOY has left his post entirely.  He is sitting on a 
     nearby bench with his GIRLFRIEND on his lap and his chef's hat 
     askew on the back of his head.

     Suddenly, the girl points toward the grill.

                              GIRLFRIEND
               Hey, look!

     The kid looks over.

     HIS POV - THE GRILL

     A platter of hot dogs on an attached cutting board.  The hot dogs 
     are exploding, bursting into flames, one by one until the whole 
     plate is engulfed.

                              BAR-B-QUE
               Holy Shit!

     He jumps up, picks up the flaming platter with his hands and 
     tosses it like a hot potato onto the cooking grid, slamming the 
     lid down with a CRASH.

     Some of the WITNESSES hoot and laugh and there's a scattering of 
     applause.

     Before Bar-b-que can take a bow for his bravery, his attention is 
     drawn to the sound of rapid POPPING.

     HIS POV

     The WAGON OF BEER on the ground near some bushes.  The pull tabs 
     are popping off and geisers of brew are shooting up toward the 
     sky.

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

     LISA opens up the DIARY.  JESSE looks over her shoulder.

                              LISA
               Something Nancy said - her last entry.
                         (reading)
               "He is evil itself.  I know now that
               I brought him into my world.  We all
               did, gave him all the energy he needed.
               Our screams were all he needed.  Now
               I will take it back - Deny him."

     She looks up at Jesse.

                              LISA
               She wasn't crazy.
                         (he holds up the book)
               All this really happened.
                         (a beat)
               You can fight him.

     Jesse looks confussed.

                              LISA
               Remember what I said?  About good
               energy and bad energy?  He thrives 
               on bad energy.  Hate, anger, fear.
               He is bad energy.
                         (a beat)
               You've been afraid of him.

     Jesse suddenly winces in painand puts his hand to his stomach.

                              JESSE
                         (panicking)
               Oh, God, he's coming back!
                         (to Lisa)
               Get out of here, Lisa!

                                                       CUT TO:

     The window SLAMS shut and LOCKS.

     LISA

     frightened, looks behind her and back to Jesse, frantically.

                              LISA
               Fight it, Jesse!

     FRONT DOOR, FOYER

     The deadbolt turns with a loud SNAP.

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - THE POLETTI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Their bedroom door LATCHES firmly.

     MR. POLETTI sits up with a start.

                              MR. POLETTI
               What was that?

     EXT. GATE - LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

     A large padlock swings around and SNAPS shut.

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

     JESSE is doubled over in pain.  Lisa has her hands on his 
     shoulders, shaking him, trying to bring him out of it.  The heat 
     has become intense in teh room; they are both sweating profusely 
     and their clothes cling to their wet bodies.

                              LISA
               You created him - you can destroy him.
               He lives off your fear.  Fight him, 
               Jesse!

                              JESSE
                         (painfully)
               I can't!

     Tiny bubbles are rising to the top of the aquarium tank and the 
     angelfish float on the surface of the water, poached.

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - THE POLETTI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     MR. POLETTI is standing inside the door in an open robe, tugging 
     on the knob as MRS POLETTI joins him at his side.

     He, too is drenched with sweat and the heat has steamed up all the 
     interior windows.

                              MRS. POLETTI
               What is it?

                              MR. POLETTI
               The lock's jammed!

     Suddenly, there is a BLAST OF MUSIC as a bedside CLOCK RADIO comes 
     to life an immediatly begins melting in the center.  The music 
     GROANS to a stop after less than a bar and the amber dial-lamp 
     dies.

     EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

     KERRY and HUNK in the pool again.  Steam is rising off the surface 
     and the water seems a bit rough for a swimming pool.

     Kerry calls out to no one in particular.

                              KERRY
               Hey, can somebody turn down the heater?

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

     JESSE is writhing on the floor as LISA jumps around him, 
     helplessly.

                              LISA
               You're not afraid of him!  He doesn't
               even exist.

     ON THE T.V.

     as it, too, comes to life with a BLAST OF SOUND, SPARKS violently 
     and dies.

     ON THE AQUARIUM

     as the water comes to a boil, the glass SHATTERS and the carpeting 
     is flooded with a wave of steaming water and dead marine life.

     EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

     as the Japanese lanterns begin to brighten considerably - as if 
     there's a power surge in the line.  Each of the bulbs begin to 
     burst, scattering a group of screaming TEENAGERS from beneath 
     them.

     INT. STUDY

     ON LISA, JESSE'S POV

     Horrified.

     ON THE DESK FRONT

     as a hand comes up into frame - FREDDY'S hand.  It scrapes up the 
     wooden panel and grips the desktop, cutting four deep notches into 
     the scrolled edge-molding.

     ON LISA

     She GASPS.

     FREDDY is standing in front of her.

                              FREDDY
                         (laughting hideously)
               He can't fight me.
                         (raising his eyebrows)
               I'm him.

     Freddy approaches, flashing his razor-knives like a set of Tiffany 
     rings.

     Lisa looks about the room for some escape.

     Freddy swings.  Lisa counters by pulling an afghan from the back 
     of one of the chairs and catching it in his blades.

     She reaches behind her for something to hit him with and comes up 
     with a heavy brass lamp from the top of the desk.  She SMASHES him 
     over the head with it.

     The impact throws him back long enough for her to slip by him and 
     run out of the study.  She slams the door behind her.

     Freddy recovers quickly from the blow and, angry now, takes after 
     her.

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - THE POLETTI BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Mr. Poletti is banging on the door and wrenching the knob.

                              MR. POLETTI
               Lisa!

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

     as LISA runs through the room, rounds the newel post of the 
     stairway and skids across the parquet floor to the front door.

     She grabs the knob and pulls.  Locked.

                              LISA
                         (screaming for help)
               Jesse!

     Panic-stricken, she turns to run.

     FREDDY LEAPS across the room at LISA.  She tries to run past him 
     but collides with him instead.  They both go down on the waxed 
     floor.

     LISA tries to scramble away.  FREDDY grabs her foot and sinks his 
     teeth into her bare calf.  She SCREAMS in pain.

     LISA kicks him in the head with her other foot.

     FREDDY strikes at her leg with his talons, but she twists away and 
     he wedges the blades deep into the oak floor.

     She squirms free as Freddy pull s and pulls on his weapon to un-
     stick it from the floor.  She runs toward the kitchen.

     EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

     KERRY and HUNK in the middle of the pool.  The surface is choked 
     with steam and their bodies are lobster-red.  They are trying to 
     get to the stairway at the low end but the water has become even 
     more turbulant and much hotter and randowm waves keep pushing them 
     back, panting, toward the deep end.

     Kerry goes under and Hunk picks her up to hold her head up above 
     the water.

                              HUNK
               Help!

     ON THE PATIO

     several BOYS rush to the fence to pull down a life-hook hanging 
     there on a bracket.

     Other TEENS stand around, wondering what's happening.

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     LISA is devastatingly frightened as she crashes through the doors 
     and quickly scans the room.

     She runs to the sliding glass doors leading out to the pool area 
     and hurls aside the draperies.

     ON the other side of the glass, FIVE KIDS tug frantically or the 
     door and bang on the glass, trying to get in.

     BACK TO LISA

     She turns toward the counter and spots

     A WOODEN KNIFE-BLOCK

     a good selection of gourmet cutlery.

     FREDDY

     crashes into the room.

     ON LISA

     jumping toward the knives.

     She grabs for the thickest handle and unsheathes it from the 
     block.  This is one hell of a KNIFE - a fourteen inch long blade 
     of carbon steel - all it needs is a blood-gutter to move it from 
     the kitchen to the battlefield.

     THE SLIDERS

     The FIVE KIDS outside the glass doors stare, aghast.

     KITCHEN

     Freddy stops in the center of the room as she swings around, 
     holding the knife in her fist defensively.

                              LISA
               Jesse, help!

                              FREDDY
               I'm Jesse now, Lisa.

     He chuckles as he raises his own weapon and rhythmically clicks 
     the blades together.  he's up for a feisty victim.

     Lisa tries to get up the courage to send the knife home.

     ON FREDDY

     His expression changes suddenly.

                              FREDDY
                         (Jesse's voice,
                          pleading)
               Kill me!  Please kill me!

     ON LISA

     She is devastated by teh sound of Jesse's voice coming from within 
     this monster.

     ON FREDDY

     himself again.

                              FREDDY
                         (mockingly)
               Go agead, Lisa.  Kill him!  Kill him!

     He steps toward her and she swings with the knife.  He jumps back, 
     inches from the blade.

     He laughs and moves for her again.

     This time she swings and hits her mark, driving the knife deep 
     into Freddy's shoulder.

     She PLUNGES the blade in, again and again, pushing him back across 
     the room.  The knife cuts long gashes but they do not bleed and 
     with each puncture of the blade, Freddy lets out a horrible laugh:

                              FREDDY
                         (Jesse's voice)
               Lisa...Lisa...I love you...I love you!

     Stunned, she steps back into the center of the room.

     She raises the knife again but she is crying hysterically and just 
     doesn't have it in her.

     Freddy catches her wrist with his bare hand and squeezes it with 
     all his strength.

     Lisa begins quaking and her knees weaken.  She closes her eyes.

                              LISA
                         (tearfully)
               Please, God...

     She drops the knife:  it sticks into the linoleum.

     ON FREDDY

     He starts to mouth a parting death-word but suddenly stops.

     TWO SHOT - LISA AND FREDDY

     Lisa opens her eyes.  He is stell standing there, poised for the 
     kill but he is staring at her with an odd expression - perhaps a 
     glint of recognition.

     Lisa stares back, wondering why she isn't dead yet.

     CLOSE ON FREDDY

     A frown of confusion distorts his ugly face and his lower lip 
     quivers slightly.

     Suddenly, he throws her aside like a fisherman tossing acks an 
     undersized flounder.

                              FREDDY
                         (as Jesse)
               Nooo...

     ON LISA

     SMASHING into the wall with force.  She slides down to the floor, 
     semi-conscious.

     BACK TO FREDDY

     he emits an agonized SCREAM and LUNGES, not at her but 

     DIVING

     through the glass doors to the pool area.

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:

     EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

     REVERSE ANGLE

     as the glass shatters into a million shimmering pieces and Freddy 
     is gone - vanishing before our eyes.

     The pool has stopped swirling although it continues to simmer.  
     KERRY, HUNK and LIFEHOOK BOY cough and shake as they are helped 
     out of the water and wrapped in towels by some FRIENDS.

     Many of the TEENS are huddled in little groups.  Some are crying, 
     others just look at the remnants of the party in disbelief.

                              TEENS
               What happened?  Where'd he go.  Etc.

     Several BRAVE BOYS approach the shattered sliders with cautious 
     curiosity.

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

     MR. and MRS. POLETTI listen to the uncomfortable silence.  they 
     look at the door as it UNLATCHES with a soft SNAP.  Wary, they 
     don't move.

     EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

     One BRAVE BOY in the group kneels down and touches his hand on the 
     patio, looking or some explanation for the shattered glass.

     ON THE TAPE DECK

     as the cassette pops itself in and switches on GLENN MILLER.  

     BACK      TO PATIO

     Everyone looks around, spooked.

     Suddenly, there is a huge RIPPING sound and FREDDY violently 
     CRASHES up through the concrete!

     ON THE KIDS

     Screaming at the sight of the monster.

     ON THE POOL

     as it begins to churn and boil.

     THE RAZOR-KNIVES

     fan open

     Brave Boy screams as Freddy swipes the knives toward his throat.  
     Before contact, we

                                                       CUT TO:

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

     as Mr. Poletti scrambles down the stairs with Mrs. poletti close 
     behind.

     EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGTH

     as FREDDY grabs another teen and throws him into the overheated 
     pool.  he SCREAMS as he hits the water.

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     ON THE DOOR

     as MR. POLETTI bursts through, followed by his wife.

     She screams when she sees

                              LISA
                         (groggily)
               He couldn't do it, Momma.

     MR. POLETTI looks up at the sound of the OFF-SCREEN SCREAMING.  He 
     rushes across the room to the sliders.

     EXT. POOLSIDE

     Total CHAOS has taken over.  KIDS are running in every direction, 
     screaming as FREDDY lashes out indiscriminately.

     A SCREAMING GIRL is PUSHED INTO THE POOL by the stampeding kids 
     and is SUCKED UNDER.

     TWO BOYS vault the WALL.  One perches on top, holding a hand out 
     to help HIS GIRL over.

                              BOY
               Come on!

     FREDDY races at them and SLASHES THE GIRL.  She drops.  The BOY 
     clambers over the wall.

     ON A FLEEING KID

     THE FLEEING KID runs toward camera (no othe rkids in shot).  As he 
     runs, he BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN, as if being held back by an 
     invisible force.  Suddenly, FREDDY APPEARS AND, AT NORMAL SPEED, 
     SLASHES THE KID.

     EXT. CHAIN LINK FENCE - POOLSIDE

     SEVERAL KIDS breaks for the gate.  The PADLOCK is secure.

     ONE KID grabs onto the chain-link fence to climb it.  The links 
     SMOKE AND SIZZLE, and the kid lets go with a scream.

     His HANDS are branded with the pattern of the steel links.

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Mr. Poletti turns whit, not believing his eyes.  He backs away 
     from the sliders.

                              MR. POLETTI
               My God!

     He backs off some more only taking his eyes off the scene to 
     glance at his wife and daughter.

                              MR. POLETTI
               Get her out of here!

     MRS. POLETTI looks back at her husband, questioningly.

                              MR. POLETTI
                         (urgently)
               Get her out of here!

     She starts to help Lisa to her feet.

     MR. POLETTI turns on his heels and runs through the kitchen doors.

     EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

     Freddy stands in the center of the patio, swinging with his claw 
     as a few DO-GOODERS circle him and try to calm him down like he 
     was just some ordinary homicidal maniac.  At Freddy's feet, 
     another hapless VICTIM.

     ONE DO-GOODER who's watched too many police dramas on T.V. jockeys 
     around Freddy and throws out some hostage control lines.

                              DO-GOODER
               Now calm down - we want to help you.

     Freddy displays his blades like a rabid cat, ready to strike.

                              FREDDY
               Help yourself, fucker.

     Behind them, a row of shrubs suddenly combusts.

     Freddy grabs him by the wrist, laughs and, swinging him around 
     like he were throwing the Hammer, sends him with a bone-splitting 
     CRASH into 

     THE GAS GRILL

     The force of the impact shears the grill from its pedestal and 
     causes a huge column of FIRE to shoot up into the heavens.

     INT. LISA'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

     MR. POLETTI swings one of the chairs into the gun case SHATTERING 
     the glass door.

     EXT. LISA'S HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

     The KIDS are trapped inside the pool area, frozen with fear, 
     hysterical.

     With the gas-fire raging to one side, he screams out like an 
     evangelist on angel dust.

                              FREDDY
               You are all my children!

     SOUND OVER: A SHOT RINGS OUT

     BLOWING AWAY a dish of potato salad on a table at Freddy's side.

     Several teens dive for cover.

     ON MR. POLETTI

     standing in the frame of the shattered sliders.  he is holding a 
     pump-action shotgun.

     as he brings the gun down to give it a second pump.

                              MR. POLETTI
               Shit!

     He raises the weapon again, but LISA rushes out and pushes the 
     barrel of the gun down.  MR. POLETTI FIRES into the patio.

                              MR. POLETTI
                         (furious)
               What are you doing?

     ON FREDDY

     he looks toward the doors and makes eye contact with Lisa.  
     Suddenly, he turns on his hells and walks

     THROUGH THE BRICK WALL as if it weren't there.  The very top of 
     his head and his hat are higher than the top of the wall and 
     remain solid as he moves through and out the other side.  There is 
     SMOKE AND SCORCH on the bricks where he passed.

     SILENCE and stunned faces.  Frightened whimpers here and there.

                              MR. POLETTI
               Where did he go?

     ON LISA

     She puts her hand to her mouth - she knows.  MRS. POLETTI has come 
     onto the patio now and joins her daughter and husband.

     Lisa turns and runs into the house.

                              MRS. POLETTI
               Where are you going?

     Lisa is already gone.

                              MR POLETTI
                         (calling her back)
               Lisa!

     JESSE'S CAR - EXT. POLETTI HOUSE - NIGHT

     LISA opens the door and gets into the driver's seat.

     SOUND OVER: POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING

     INT. JESSE'S CAR

     She looks at the make-shift switches and tries to remember how 
     Jesse.

     She flicks the toggle and pushes the starter button.  Nothing.

     She remembers the two wires under the dash and twists them 
     together.  She pushes the starter button.

     The starter GROANS.  It doesn't seem like it's going to start.

     ON LISA

                              LISA
                         (frantically)
               Please work, please.

     The car back-fires and starts.  She puts it into gear and pulls 
     out.

     EXT. DARK HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     as the old FALCON tears down the highway.

     INT. JESSE'S CAR

     LISA is at the wheel, squinting through the darkness, trying to 
     hold the road.

     EXT. ABANDONED POWERHOUSE - NIGHT

     Lisa pulls up to the building and shuts the engine off.

     INSIDE

     She hastily tears a strip of cloth from her shirt and ties it 
     around the wound on her leg.  She gets out of the car.

     She steps up to the front of the building.

     HER POV

     The entrance is ringed by A PAIR OF MANGY WILD DOGS WITH EERIE, 
     UNNATURAL FACES who growl threateningly as she approaches.

     She shows no fear as she steps right up to the enterance.  THey 
     snap at her hands but she doesn't pull them out of the way.  They 
     part, allowing her to pass through.

     INT. POWERHOUSE - NIGHT

     LISA walks in cautiously.  The powerhouse looks fare different 
     than it did in daylight -- mysterious, dangerous, brewing, almost 
     alive.  Steam is leaking from between rusty rivets and torn 
     gaskets and we hear the POUNDING of ancient expansion tanks 
     belching out rancid air.

     The interior is bathed in an electric blue light that 
     intermittently washes pale as hot white arcs flash in distant 
     corners of the building.

     She walks in deeper, carelessly touching her fingers to a large 
     steam pipe and retracting her hand quickly from its blistering 
     sting.

     She stops at the center of the room.  Suddenly, a twinge of pain 
     on her face and she looks down at ehr leg.

     now, serious pain as she bends over and frenziedly pulls up on the 
     make-shift bandage.

     ON HER WOUND

     It is SWARMING with big, black, carpenter ants.

     She screams and brushes them away with her hands, quaking with 
     disgust.

     As abruptly as they appeared, they are gone; the blood-soaked 
     bandage is intact, covering the wound.

     She bhacks away from teh sump and begins climbing the rusted metal 
     stairway up to the catwalk.

     SOUND OVER:  SCRAPING METAL

     She stops midway and looks around, frightened.

     A few seconds to regain her courage and she steps onto the 
     walkway.

     A RAT

     -- the one she met before -- scurries at her.  It stops, stares at 
     her evilly, hisses unnaturally.

     Lisa screams.

     Suddenly, a CAT pounces on the rat.

     The cat looks up at Lisa with ONLY THE TAIL OF THE RAT STICKING 
     OUT OF ITS MOUTH.  Its eyes are demonic, its teeth crooked yellow 
     fangs.  It growls like a beast five times its size.  The cat takes 
     another chomp on the rat, and the rat's tail disappears down its 
     gullet.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     LISA jumps down off the sairway onto the catwalk and starts to 
     run.  She CLANGS over the steel-mesh flooring.

     A section of the catwalk gives way beneath her feet and 

     LISA plummets as if she were dropped through a trap door.  Her 
     arms flail over her head, but her hand manages to grab around a 
     section of handrail that's still solid.

     ANOTHER ANGLE

     we see the catwalk is intact - it looks as if her knees just gave 
     out but she continues to hold on to the railing for dear life.

     She tests the flooring by feeling it before attempting to rise ore 
     release her grip.

     She rises and turns around.

     FREDDY is there.

     Lisa SCREAMS.

                              FREDDY
               Had your chance.
                         (raising his talons)
               Die now!

     He slashes at her.  She ducks and runs back toward the stairway.

     The STAIRWAY IS RED HOT, SMOKING.

     FREDDY closes in.

                              FREDDY
               Come to me, Lisa - I'm waiting for you.

     Lisa stops short, looks around desperately.  There is nowhere to 
     go.

                              LISA
               Oh, God, Jesse - I know you're there!
               Stop him!

                              FREDDY
               Jesse's dead, Lisa.  Freddy's here.

     Freddy strikes, cutting Lisa's shoulder.

                              LISA
                         (screams)
               Jesse!

     Freddy closes in on her.  She is trapped, finished.

                              FREDDY
                         (smiles perversely)
               Wanna join your little friend?

                              LISA
               Where's Jesse?

                              FREDDY
               There is no Jesse.  I'm Jesse now.

                              LISA
               I want him back.  Jesse, talk to me.
               Jesse!

     Freddy raises his talons for the kill.  The sharp oints are within 
     an inch of her eyes.  Lisa, terrified, summons up all her energy, 
     all her might, and looks Freddy in the eye.

                              LISA
               I love you, Jesse!

     Freddy stares at ehr, talons frozen in mid-air.  The horrible hand 
     quivers, as if against an unseen force.  And then --

     The wounds on Freddy's shoulder and chest rip open.

     He looks down at them, surprised.  They bleed real, human blood.

     LONGER ANGLE

     Lisa breaks past him and starts to run but stops suddenly, a few 
     paces from Freddy.  She turns to look at him leaning weakly 
     against the railing, with an expression of confusion on his face 
     that is almost pathetic.  he touches his wounds, surprised.

     Lisa is no longer afraid - she's angry now.  She looks him 
     straight in the eye.

     His razor-knives click together like they're running low on 
     batteries.

     Freddy beckons her over with the knife on his index finger.

                              FREDDY
                         (Jesse's voice)     
               Come and get me, Lisa.

     Freddy laughs wickedly.

     LISA moves a step toward Freddy.

                              LISA
               I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't
               kill me...He's in there and I want
               him back.  I'm gonna take him away
               from you and you're going straight 
               back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!

                              FREDDY
                         (getting angry)
               Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!

     Lisa moves closer to Freddy.

                              LISA
               Come back to me, Jesse.

     She locks her gaze on Freddy's eyes and looks right through him.

                              LISA
               I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.

                              FREDDY
               He's dead, you bitch.

     Freddy seems to be in a good deal of pain.  He drops to one knee.  
     Lisa moves closer.  He tries to move away from her.

                              FREDDY
                         (threateningly)
               I'll kill you now.

                              LISA
                         (ignoring him)
               He can't hold you Jesse.  He's losing
               his grip - you can get out.

                              FREDDY
               He'll die with me!

     She kneels beside Freddy, takes off his hat and begins to lovingly 
     stroke his head.  he seems to be writhing a bit and emits several 
     frightened moans.

                              FREDDY
               He'll die with both of us!

     She gathers all her nerve and moves in closer.

     He lifts his deadly hand and presses it into her chest.  She 
     flinches in pain but continues to come in close until her mouth is 
     almost touching his.

     he moves his blades onto her back, trying to push them into her 
     flesh, but he is too weak to do much damage.

     TIGHTER ANGLE

     Locked in this strange embrace, she presses her lips against his 
     with as much passion as she can muster and KISSES HIM.

     LONGER ANGLE:  FREDDY & LISA

     There is a moment of quiet.  Then smoke starts to rise off of 
     Freddy.  He pushes her away with an excruciating SCREAM.

     The sound of the POUNDING machinery is becoming deafening.  The 
     electric FLASHES are firing more rapidly and arcing across the 
     Power Plant.  The room is RAPIDLY HEATING UP.

     A SMALL FLAME shoots along the railing.

     SMALL FIRES begin to break out on the catwalk around Freddy.

     ANGLE: PAINTED SURFACE

     The PAINT BEGINS TO SMOKE AND BUBBLE with the heat.  As the heat 
     increases it INTO FLAME.

     ON PIPES 

     STEAM begins shooting up from every pipe joint.

     ANOTHER ANGLE:  PIPES

     STEAM shoots out of the valves.  heavy iron VALVE WHEELS SPIN OFF 
     THEIR STEMS and roll down the FLAMING CATWALKS.

     ON LISA

     Surrounded by flames and smoke, she watches it all with fear and 
     amazement.

     CLOSE ON FREDDY

     His flesh is starting to melt.

     LONGER ANGLE:  FREDDY

     He bursts into DENSE, ALL-ENGULFING FLAME.

     The power plant is going crazy:  the steaming, smoking, and 
     flaming all reach their high peak.  Pipes are bursting with steam:  
     valve wheels flying off.

     Andthen everything begins to slow down, ease off.

     The flames are dying down around the charred corpse, and we can 
     see it is no longer moving.

     The little fires around him are also dying down.

     And the smoke, the steam, and the deafening noise abate.

     ON FREDDY'S CORPSE

     The fires are out now.  there is only some smoke.  And the 
     terrible heat has turned to COOL BLUE LIGHT.

     The still smoldering corpse, with its back to us, begins to stir.

     LONGER ANGLE: CATWALK

     Lisa backs away, terrified.  The corpse turns to her -- it is 
     Jesse, his clothes smoldering, his body singed and blackened with 
     soot.  But alive, coming around as if it were all just a bad 
     dream.

     LISA moves to him and cradles him in her arms.

                                                      FADE OUT

     FADE IN:

     EXT. WALSH HOUSE - DAY

     A SHINY NEW SCHOOL BUS rolls down the street.  It pulls up by the 
     curb near the Walsh House.

     JESSE, his RIGHT ARM IN A SLING but otherwise fresh and happy, 
     kisses MOM goodbye at the FRONT DOOR.  He hurries down to the bus, 
     gets in.  The DOORS fold shut, the GEARS GRIND and the bus 
     continues along its route.

     INT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

     There are about a DOZEN KIDS in the bus, playing radios, having a 
     good time, etc.

     LISA, in the back, waves to Jesse and smiles.  She wears a BANDAGE 
     on her shoulder where Freddy slashed her.  Jesse, in the front 
     smiles and waves back.

     Jesse makes his way down the aisle to Lisa, greeting a few kids, 
     slapping a hand or two.

     ON JESSE & LISA

     Jesse plops down next to her, gives her a quick kiss, puts his 
     good arm around her.

                              JESSE
               Hi.

                              LISA
               Hi.

     Lisa chuckles.

                              JESSE
               What's so funny?

                              LISA
               We must look like a couple of escapees
               from a veterans' hospital.

     Jesse smiles and shakes his head.

                              JESSE
               I can't believe we actually --

     Lisa puts a finger to her mouth to cut him off -- no need to tell 
     about unpleasant things.  Jesse smiles again -- she's right.  he 
     kisses her.

     Jesse moves his head away from hers for the big kiss.  Lisa's eyes 
     are closed, ready to receive it.

     She opens her eyes.  They are pupil-less, blood-streaked, demonic.  
     With an EVIL ROAR, a huge SERPENT TONGUE FLICKS OUT of her mouth 
     and attacks Jesse who screams.

     EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE - DAY

     The bus WHINES near the top end of third, all of its FLASHERS 
     firing wildly.  It races away through the desert in a cloud of 
     dust.

                                                      FADE OUT
