     1  PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN

     It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through 
     the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the 
     trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.

     Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to 
     the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;
     then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to 
     emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set 
     of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, 
     in a psychedelic  hand, are the words: "Gook Killer." 
     The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier 
     beneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no 
     shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is
     painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the 
     right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and
     slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.

     Our VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though 
     unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.
     We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the
     swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can
     in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.
     As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow 
     and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted
     in a paisley design.

     Now the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST
     the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in
     ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.
     ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black
     pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.
     Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make
     no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of
     eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.

     The VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER
     AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front
     about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags
     and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun
     casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles
     laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH
     US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out 
     with AUTOMATIC FIRE.

     Out VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,
     screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS
     appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that
     we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.
     Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from
     feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long
     savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;
     they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.
     They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their
     bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.
     They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US
     as they move.

     The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping
     mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.

     We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly
     running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,
     only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN
     painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW
     FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME
     and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die
     around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS
     are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is
     frightened.

     An AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign
     on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down
     TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the
     dead.

     OUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a
     Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be
     stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS
     with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth
     and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US
     and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,
     bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,
     electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :


          MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW


     2  TITLE SEQUENCE

     The CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, 
     growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;
     transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely
     look at, like the sun itself.

     Then it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once
     again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It
     is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of
     cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more
     distant. The TITLES CONTINUE.

     We are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the
     stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the
     MUSIC  now.

     We MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,
     as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.

     We are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,
     close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;
     CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;
     Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like
     shapes of :


     3  EXT. MARINA DEL REY

     The VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin
     cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.

     It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in
     bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking
     cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the
     head of a large American Corporation, and this is his
     party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to
     catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces
     smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war
     paint. Charlie is going on and on :

                    CHARLIE
          ... It's crazy -- sugar is up to
          200 dollars a ton -- sugar !

                    LAWYER
          What about oil ?

                    CHARLIE
          Food, oil --look, let me show you
          something. This is the economy of
          the United States in two years --

     He takes a newspaper, draws a circle.

                    CHARLIE
               (continuing)
          This is West Germany.
               (he draws another,
                bigger circle)
          This is Japan.
               (another , bigger)
          This is Italy.
               (a dot)
          This is Iran.
               (a very big circle)
          And this is Saudi Arabia... In
          two years ?
               (a gigantic circle)
          Do you understand ?

                    ACCOUNTANT
          What's to prevent it ?

                    CHARLIE
          Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you,
          I didn't build a two-billion-dollar
          company in the last twenty years
          by doing nothing. We can protect
          our interests.
               (pause, for a drink)
          We are still the most powerful
          nation in the world. Militarily.

     He leans to his associates, in a half-whisper.

                    CHARLIE
               (continuing)
          You know bodyguard; he was a
          captain in Viet Nam. You talk to
          him, except he won't talk. This
          kind of man can kill you with his
          pinky. A nice quiet fella, though.

     The VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group.

                    CHARLIE
               (continuing)
          Carries a attache case at all
          times. You know what's in it ?
               (another sip)
          An Ingram Machine pistol.

     Gradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a
     NEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it :

          CHARLIE                         WILLARD (V.O.)
     I don't tahe chances, and               Bullshit. You can kill
     neither should this country.               with the ridge of your
     If we're strong, we should               hand to the throat; you
     protect our interests, and               can crush a skull with
     we should have the respect               your knee... but you
     of the world, even if it                    can't kill anybody with
     takes another war.                    your pinky.

     The VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party :
     Pictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the
     good life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          The attache case has been empty
          for three years, but it makes him
          safe to think there's a machine
          pistol in it.

          I don't like automatic weapons.
          They jam.

          I saw a friend of mine get
          ripped open because he flicked his
          M-16 to automatic, and it jammed.
          How much money did the contractors
          make on the M-16 ?

     Our VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some
     reading, flirting, drinking.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
               (continuing)
          He likes to hear stories about Nam.
          I tell him I can't; they're not
          cleared. The truth is he wouldn't
          understand.

     We can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the
     opposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We 
     MOVE CLOSER.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
               (continuing)
          There's no way I can tell them...
          what really happened over there.

          I wouldn't've believed it if
          someone'd told me.

     We are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips
     from a beer, but we cannot see his face.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
               (continuing)
          There was only one part that
          mattered -- for me, anyway. I
          don't even know if I remember
          all of it. I can't remember
          how it ended, exactly -- because
          when it ended I was insane.

                                   DISSOLVE TO :

     4  EXT. A STREET IN SAIGON - DAY

     A Saigon boom street in late 1968. There are bars and
     shops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes.
     Our VIEW MOVES TOWARD one particular officer; B.L.
     WILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed
     by four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his
     shoes and sell him things.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          But I know how it started
          for me -- I was on R. and R.
          in Saigon; my first time south
          of the DMZ in three months. I
          wasn't sure, but I thought this
          guy was following me.

     Willard looks back.


     5  HIS VIEW

     an American CIVILIAN.


     6  MED. VIEW

     Willard ducks into a bar.


     7  INT. THE SAIGON BAR - DAY

     Not much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few
     tables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly
     crowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly
     past the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching
     sight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by.

     An INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of
     drinks and approaches Willard's table.

                    CAPTAIN
          How about a drink ?

                    WILLARD
          Sure, thanks.

     He sits down at the table with the drinks.

                    CAPTAIN
          Winning the war by yourself.

                    WILLARD
               (he calls for the waiter)
          Part.

                    CAPTAIN
          Which part is that ?

                    WILLARD
          My part.
               (TO THE WAITER)
          Beer, with ice and water.

        
                    CAPTAIN
          That's good gin.

                    WILLARD
          I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.

                    CAPTAIN
          Delta ?

                    WILLARD
          No.

                    CAPTAIN
          North ?

                    WILLARD
          Yeah. Way north.

                    CAPTAIN
          What unit were you with ?

                    WILLARD
          None.

                    CAPTAIN
          Rangers, eh?

                    WILLARD
          Sort of.

     The JUKE BOX starts BLARING. Annoyed , Willard looks over
     his shoulder.

                    CAPTAIN
          Were you Longe Range Recon --

                    WILLARD
          No -- I worked too far north for
          LRRP.

     He reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the
     Captain leans over the table to light it for him. Willard
     notices the CIVILIAN on the street has glanced in the bar,
     then enters and sits down at a table by the doorway.

                    CAPTAIN
          That's quite an array of ribbons...

                    WILLARD
          Let's talk about you.

                    CAPTAIN
          I was an FO for the 25th.

                    WILLARD
          Tracks ?

                    CAPTAIN
          Yeah.

                    WILLARD
          Fat. That's real fat.

                    CAPTAIN
          Sometimes.

                    WILLARD
          At least you always have enough
          water. How many gallons does
          each one of those damn things
          carry ?

                    CAPTAIN
          Thirty -- sometimes fifty.

                    WILLARD
          You know, I can remember once,
          getting back below the DMZ -- and
          the first Americans we ran into
          were a track squadron. I just
          couldn't believe how much water
          they had. We'd been chewing
          bamboo shoots for almost a week,
          and before that, for two weeks,
          we'd been drinking anything --
          rain water, river shit, stuff
          right out of the paddies. And
          there were these guys standing
          by their trucks spilling water
          all over. I could've killed them.
               (solemnly)
          I swear to God I would have, too,
          if ...

                    CAPTAIN
          I didn't know we had units up
          there in North Vietnam.

                    WILLARD
          We do.

                    CAPTAIN
          How long were you up there ?

                    WILLARD
          A long time.

                    CAPTAIN
          A year ? Waiter another beer.

                    WILLARD
          I go up on missions. Listen
          Captain, buy me all the beer
          you want, but you better tell
          that asshole over there you're
          not going to find out anymore
          about me.

     Willard glances over his shoulder and indicates the
     Civilian. The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain.
     He rises and comes over to the bar.

                    WILLARD
               (continuing)
          What do you want ?

                    CIVILIAN
               (indicating the Army jeep)
          If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon
          Group, we'd like you to come with
          us.

                    WILLARD
          Whose orders ?

                    CAPTAIN
          Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th
          A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 --
          Com-Sec -- Intelligence --
          Nha Trang.

                    WILLARD
          Who are you ?

                    CIVILIAN
          The agency.

     Willard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks
     roght out toward the jeep without saying another word.
     The Civilian follows.


     8  EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

     A darkly painted "HUEY" ROARS over low paddies and jungle
     before emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed
     wire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily
     fortified, concealed compound.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          They took me to some place outside
          Nha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters
          for all operations in South East Asia.
          I'd worked for Intelligence before --

     Armed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A
     large camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground
     corridor -- they enter.


     9  FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM

     A door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to
     attention, blocking the view of the room. A strange
     reddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic
     maps and filled with smoke.

     The whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself
     and there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly
     reclaiming it.

                    WILLARD
          Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters,
          reporting as ordered, sir.

                    COLONEL (O.S.)
          Okay, Willard, sit down.

     Willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a
     bare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks
     and tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL
     puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind
     him sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN.

                    COLONEL
          Have you ever seen this officer
          before, Captain Willard ?

     He points to the Major.

                    WILLARD
          No, sir.

                    COLONEL
          This gentleman or myself ?

                    WILLARD
          No, sir.

                    COLONEL
          I believe on your last job you
          executed a tax collector in Kontum,
          is that right ?

                    WILLARD
          I am not presently disposed to
          discuss that, sir.

                    MAJOR
          Very good.

     He turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The
     Colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map.

                    COLONEL
          You know much about about Special Forces;
          Green Berets, Captain ?

                    WILLARD
          I've worked with them on occasions
          and I saw the movie , sir.

     The officer smiles at this.

                    COLONEL
          Then you can appreciate Command's
          concern over their -- shall we say
          'erratic' methods of operation.
               (pause)
          I have never favored elite units,
          Captain, including your paratroopers
          or whatever. Just because a man
          jumps out of an airplane or wears
          a silly hat doesn't give him any
          priviliges in my book -- not in
          this man's army.

                    MAJOR
          We didn't need 'em in Korea --
          no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy
          and an M-1 Garand, none of this
          fancy crap -- no sir.

                    CIVILIAN
               (stopping him)
          Major.

                    COLONEL
          We have Special Forces A
          detachments all along the
          Cambodian border. Two here and
          another one here -- twelve or
          fourteen Americans -- pretty
          much on their own; they train
          and motivate Montagnard natives;
          pick their own operations. If
          they need something, they call 
          for it, and get it within
          reason. What we're concerned
          with is here.

          The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
          It was originally a larger base,
          built up along the river in an
          old Cambodian fortress.
     
          The area has been relatively
          quiet for the past two years --
          but --

                    COLONEL
          ... Captain, we know something's
          going on up there -- Major --

     The Major looks at some papers in front of him.

                    MAJOR
          Communications naturally dwindled
          with the lack of V.C. activity,
          this is routine, expected ... but
          six months ago communication
          virtually stopped.

                    COLONEL
          About the same time -- large numbers
          of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent
          began leaving the area -- this in
          itself is not unusual since these
          people have fought with the Rhade
          Tribe that lived in the area for
          centuries. But what is unusual is
          that we began to find Rhade refugees
          too -- in the same sampans as the
          M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid
          of V.C. They've put up with war
          for twenty years -- but something
          is driving them out.

                    MAJOR
          We communicate with the base
          infrequently. What they call for
          are air strikes, immediate --
          always at night. And we don't
          know what or who the air strikes
          are called on.

                    WILLARD
          Who ?

                    MAJOR
          You see, no one has really gone
          into this area and come back alive.

                    WILLARD
          Why me ?

                    MAJOR
          Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel,
          Special Forces. We understand
          you knew him.

     He puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand.

                    WILLARD
          Yeah.

                    COLONEL
          He's commanding the detachment
          at Nu Mung Ba.

     The Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder,
     flicks it on. The recording is first STATIC -- the
     AIR CONTROLLER then asks for more information on target
     coordinates -- it all sounds very routine, military.
     Then a frantic VOICE comes on, talking slurred, like
     someone dumb, except very fast.

                    VOICE (ON TAPE)
          Up 2 -- 0 -- give it to me quick --
          Mark flare -- affirmative damn --
          Immediate receive -- hearing
          automatic weapons fire man ...

     GUNFIRE is HEARD and a lower, slower VOICE in background.

                    SECOND VOICE
          Blue Delta five
          This Big Rhine -- three
          Need that ordinance immediately
          Goddamn give it to me immediate
          Christ -- Big Rhino --
          Blue God -- Delta damn -- goddamn.

     A heavy BURST of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE -- INSANE LAUGHTER
     -- STATIC, and faintly, very faintly we HEAR HARD ROCK
     MUSIC -- more STATIC -- suddenly a low, clear VOICE
     peaceful and serene, almost tasting the words.

                    THIRD VOICE
          This is Big Rhino six -- Blue Delta.

                    MAJOR
          That's Colonel Kurtz.

                    KURTZ (V.O.)
          I want that napalm dropped in the
          trees -- spread it among the
          branches.

          We'll give you a flare -- an
          orange one -- bright orange.
               (STATIC)
          We'd also like some white phosporous,
          Blue Delta. White phosporous, give
          it to me.

     STATIC interrupts -- the Major turns the machine off.

                    WILLARD
          I only met Kurtz once.

                    CIVILIAN
          Would he remember you ?

                    WILLARD
          Maybe.

                    COLONEL
          What was your impression of him ?

     Willard shrugs.

                    CIVILIAN
          You didn't like him.

                    WILLARD
          Anyone got a cigarette.

     The Major offers him one; they wait as he lights up, thinks.

                    WILLARD
               (continuing)
          I thought he was a lame.

                    COLONEL
          A lame ?

                    WILLARD
          This is years ago, before he
          joined Special Forces, I guess.
          We had an argument.

                    COLONEL
          About what ?

                    WILLARD
          I don't know. He was a lame,
          that's all.

                    COLONEL
          But why ?

                    WILLARD
          He couldn't get through a
          sentence without all these
          big words; about why we kill.

                    COLONEL
          Well, he's killing now.

                    WILLARD
          Maybe.

                    CIVILIAN
          What does that mean ?

                    WILLARD
          Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't
          believe he's capable of that.
          I just don't believe it.

                    COLONEL
          It's got to be Kurtz.

                    CIVILIAN
          The point is that Kurtz or
          somebody attacked a South
          Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three
          days ago. Last week a Recon
          helicopter was lost in the area --
          another took heavy damage --
          direct fire from their base
          camp.

                    WILLARD
          Our Recon flight ?

                    CIVILIAN
          Ours.

                    WILLARD
          Touchy.

                    CIVILIAN
          You can see, of course, the
          implications, if any of this --
          even rumours leaked out.

                    WILLARD
          You want me to clean it up --
          simple and quiet.

                    CIVILIAN
          Exactly -- you'll go up the
          Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. --
          appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by
          accident, re-establish your
          acquintance with Colonel Kurtz,
          find out what's happened -- and
          why. Then terminate his command.

                    WILLARD
          Terminate ?

                    CIVILIAN
          Terminate with extreme prejudice.

     A waterway leading out to the ocean -- it is broken and
     divided into hundreds of channels, islands, water farms.

     A Navy patrol boat (P.B.R.) is waiting by a dock area.
     This is small, light craft, very fast, and heavily
     armed. Its men stand at attention in a small and simple
     military ceremony. Willard approaches them in battle-
     dress: Tiger suit, full field pack, forty-five, helmet,
     M-16. The boat commander salutes Willard.

     We hear the introductions faintly, UNDER Willard's VOICE.
               
                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          I met the P.B.R. crew; they were
          pretty much all kids, except for
          Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's
          Mate Third Class L. Johnson --
          Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate
          Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef --
          Radio Operator Second Class T.
          Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.

                    WILLARD
          Chief, try to keep out of where
          we're going -- Why we're goin' and
          what's gonna be the big surprise.

                    CHIEF
          All right with me, I used to drive
          a taxi.

                    WILLARD
          Let's go.

     The Chief nods.  They all break formation and jump aboard
     and otherwise go about their work.

     The twin diesels kick up -- and t he boat moves away from
     the dock. The Chef jumps aboard; Lance mans the forward
     twin fifty-caliber machine guns -- they wave to the guards
     on the dock and move away into the complexity that leads
     to the ocean.

     back from his position. He looks at Willard, who just
     stares ahead into space, swallowing.

                    CHIEF
          The Delta closes off to us about
          ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll
          be able to pick up some supplies --
          bit I think there are only two
          points we can draw enough water
          to get into the Nung River. It's
          all Charlie's turf from there on
          out.

                    WILLARD
          We're gonna have some help to
          get in the river. You know
          these waters, Chief ?

                    CHIEF
          'Bout six months ago I took a man
          up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was
          regular Army too. Shot himself
          in the head. I brought his body 
          back down.

                    WILLARD
          Shot himself. What for ?

                    CHIEF
          Beats me -- the sun was too much
          for him, or the mud. Who knows ?

     Pause, looking at Willard.


     18  CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD

     Suddenly, his attention is diverted -- there is a slow
     buffeting, as if the air around them is being sucked out
     and replaced quickly. The boat shakes slightly. There
     is a distant ROLLING NOISE like interrupted thunder. All
     the men have stopped whatever they're doing -- stand up
     and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills
     beyond. The buffeting and NOISE CONTINUES -- they all
     stand silently -- suddenly it stops.

          I hate that -- Every time I hear
          that noise something terrible 
          happens.

                    CHIEF
          Anybody see some smoke ?

          Too far inland.

     They are looking up. Willard sits down, unconcerned.
     He takes out the dossier given him by ComSec. He
     flips through the letters and other documents.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          The dossier on A detachment had
          letters from Kurtz' wife and the
          wives and families of his men.
          All asking where to send future
          mail, understanding the necessery
          silence due to the nature of
          their work -- None of the men had
          written home in half a year.

     Occasionally, in the b.g., we FEEL the terrifying buffeting
     of the distant B-52 BOMBING.

     22  MONTAGE - PICTURES OF KURTZ

     Kurtz' face evolves through the various stages of his
     career as represented in the pictures in the dossier,
     as Willard reads :

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a
          dedicated and well-disciplined
          spirit. He is a fine officer,
          combining military efficiency --
          with a broad background in the
          Humanities, the Arts and Sciences ...

     Another picture of Kurtz in Germany, standing next to the
     161st Petroleum Supply Group sign.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
               (continuing)
          ... He views his military career
          as the dedication of his talents
          to bringing our values and way of
          life to those darker, less
          fortunate areas in the world.

     A SHOT of Kurtz at jump school.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
               (continuing)
          ... I feel Captain Kurtz' request
          for Special Forces training is
          highly unusual in regard to his
          past humanitarian concerns, and
          his somewhat liberal politics,
          though I can see no reason to
          deny it.

     A CLOSE SHOT of Kurtz with Green Beret on in the Vietnam
     jungle. His face is blank and vacant.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
               (continuing)
          ... We feel Major Kurtz' need to
          bring a sense of Western culture
          to the backward peoples of these
          areas will be of use in
          accordance with our 'Vietnamization'
          programs ...

     MOVE IN TO Kurtz' empty eyes until the photograph is just
     a BLURRED MASS OF DOTS.

     23  EXT. HAU FAT - AN ADVANCE STAGING AREA

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          One day later we came to an
          advanced staging area along the
          coast. This was our last chance
          to pick up supplies before
          approaching the mouth of the
          Nung River.
           
     The VIEW OF THE COASTLINE leading up along the long load-
     ing docks at Hau Fat, an advance staging area for opera-
     tions "Brute Force" and "Mailed Fist."

     Everywhere are tents -- oil drums -- sandbagged bunkers --
     helicopters -- tanks -- guns -- men. Nobody builds
     advanced staging areas like the Americans.

     As the P.B.R. approaches the docking area, Lance notices
     something.

                    LANCE
          Hey.

     They look as a Chris-craft speeds by pulling a fancy water-
     skier who waves as he slaloms by. The men just look at
     one another.

     The P.B.R. pulls in -- the men scan the busy surroundings.

                    CHIEF
          Lance -- I want you to go with the
          Captain an' get three extra drums
          of fuel and maybe scrounge some
          more 50 caliber.

                    LANCE
          Yeah -- look at those uniforms.

     A platoon drills in the hot, lazy sun; they are clean and

     airplane.

                    CHIEF
          Poor bastards, have a long year
          to go.

     The troops turn and march TOWARD US with six weeks of
     Advanced Infantry Training to back them up.


     26  FULL SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R. - CREW

     They are tying up at the dock -- a young SERGEANT is fill-
     ing cut papers concerning them and talking with Willard.

                    SERGEANT
          I don't know anything about these
          papers, sir.

                    WILLARD
          They're in order -- it's perfectly
          clean -- just check with ComSec-
          Intel like I said.

                    SERGEANT
          Well, you know I don't have the
          priority to do that, sir. It
          says here not to contact Com-Sec-
          Int. Who's your commanding 
          officer ?

                    WILLARD
          Right now -- I am.

                    SERGEANT
          Well who the hell verifies that ?

                    WILLARD
          I do.

     He signs it quickly, leaving the Sergeant totally confused.

                    CHIEF
          No shit -- what's all the activity
          for around here ?

                    SERGEANT
          The show --

                    WILLARD
          What show ?

                    SERGEANT
          Big show in the parade grounds
          this noon -- some boss stuff --

                    WILLARD
          This -- Bob Hope or the like --

                    SERGEANT
          No sir, I think -- this'll be a
          little bit different --

                    CHIEF
          Where's it gonna be ?

     He points --


     27  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - PEDESTAL

     A large, well-built pedestal has been erected -- this is
     surrounded by a deep moat filled with punji stakes and
     garnished with concertina wire. It is empty --

                                   DISSOLVE TO :


     28  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

     The entire area around the pedestal and right up to the
     wire is mobbed with seething American fighting men. Some
     of these boys have just gotten here -- others have been in
     the jungle for months. All have one thing in common, to
     see and if possible grab an American girl. Their need far
     surpasses that of the run-of-the-mill rapist, pervert,
     or child-molester. To counter their need of course are
     the moat, punji stakes and barbed wire -- but implementing
     this are seven "riot control positions" equipped with the
     lastest in teargas launchers, attack-trained German shep-
     herds and assorted psychological warfare aides. Even so
     armed, the great mass of wild men are right up to the wire.


     29 FORWARD AREA

     jammed in the crowd

                    CHEF
          It's really too much -- I mean
          I've collected every picture of
          her since she was Miss December.

                    CLEAN
          Yeah -- you can really get hung
          up on them like the cat in the
          Delta.

                    CHIEF
          What cat  ?

                    CLEAN
          One that went up for murder -- he
          was an Army Sergeant.

                    CHIEF
          I never heard about that.

                    CLEAN
          Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy
          mag, man -- I mean like he was there
          when it arrived -- He just knew.

                    CHEF
          So what happened ?

                    CLEAN
          He was working A.R.V.N. patrols
          and had one a them little cocky
          gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow,
          the Lieutenant took his new Playboy
          one day, sat on the end of the dock,
          and wouldn't give it back.

                    CHEF
          Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.

                    CLEAN
          Then went too far -- he sat
          there and starts mutilating the
          centerfold. Poking pins in her an'
          all that. Sergeant says, don't do
          her like that. You leave your
          shitty little hands off that girl.
          Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in
          Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't
          do that again. You'll wish you
          hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked
          his iron to rock and roll and gave
          the little zero a long burst
          through the Playboy mag. Man, it
          blew him clean off the dock --
          Hell, just the magazine was floatin'
          there all full of holes.

                    CHIEF
          They nail him for it bad ?

                    CLEAN
          He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't
          give him no medals or nothing --

     In the b.g., we begin to HEAR a SWELL of TWO THOUSAND
     MALE VOICES; the ENGINES of four helicopters approaching.
     All heads turn skywards while one descends onto the
     pedestal kicking up a lot of dust and general resentment.
     On the nose amd doors of the black Huey are painted large
     Playboy rabbits. Finally the blades are trimmed and a
     strange silence descends over the men. The door of the
     copter slides partially open -- two young Green Berets
     step out with M-16's to varied catcalls. When this
     abates a young, extremelly well-dressed man emerges. He
     is the epitome of a Hollywood AGENT. Hair is combed
     impeccably and free of dandruff -- clothes are formal
     but hip -- shoes are shined -- Quite some dude -- his
     presence causes some stirring but seems to strangely
     quiet the man.

     He walks over to the microphone.

                    AGENT
          I'd like to say hello from all of
          us up here, to all of you out there.
          All of you who've worked so hard
          during Operation Brute Force --
          Paratroopers -- Infantry -- Airmen
          -- Medics -- Marines -- and Sailors.
          And I want you to know that we feel
          proud of you and know how hard your
          job is. To prove it -- we've brought
          some entertainment we think you're
          gonna like: The Playmate of the Year
          and her two runners up !

     He pulls open the door and three unbelieveably beautiful
     sex playmates in fringed go-go outfits leap out and start
     dancing to the Creedence Clearwater Revival singing
     "Suzy Q."


     30  MONTAGE ON THE GIRLS AND MEN

     VARIOUS SHOTS as the girls dance in an incredibly erotic
     manner -- smiling.

     The faces of the G.I.'s pass -- their jaws drop -- some
     look almost horrified. Chef is hypnotized -- Mr. Clean
     cries. Chief mouths unspoken obscenities with sentimental
     tenderness.

     Others grab the air in front of them. With each movement
     their need increases by the square.


     31  FULL SHOT - PEDESTAL - GIRLS - MEN

     They crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the
     wire -- the guards in the "riot control positions" forget
     -- the attack dogs are trampled. The mob as one surges
     forward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat,
     which is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he
     has seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke
     grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows,
     then the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black
     Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach
     it. They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss. The
     Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below.

     Such are the ways of war.

                                   CUT TO:


     32  EXT. FULL VIEW - DAY

     The P.B.R. moving further up the primitive coastline.
     There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no
     boats -- just the overwhelming presence of the jungle.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          Two days out of Hau Fat, there was
          nothing but us and the coastline.
          I felt like I had set off for
          the center of the earth...

     Suddenly, Chief looks out, ahead.

                    CHIEF
          Smoke !

                    WILLARD
          Where ?

     They all turn. Chief points up the coast.


     33 FULL SHOT - THE COASTLINE

     A thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle.

                    WILLARD
          Black smoke ... secondary burning.

     The Chief grabs field glasses.

                    CHIEF
          Yeah -- fishing village --
          helicopters over there. Hueys,
          lots of 'em.

                    WILLARD
          First Air Cavalry. They're the
          ones gonna get us into the River.


     34 FULL SHOT - THE BEACH AND VILLAGE

     A vast field of devastation -- smashed and smoking palm
     trees -- deep, ragged craters -- gutted and burning huts
     -- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the
     surf.


     35  MED. SHOT - BEACH - WILLARD AND CREW

     They wade through the water to the beach where they are
     met by a heavily armed group of men.

     Overhead jets swoop by FIRING ROCKETS, the NOISE drowning
     out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men.

     We can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the
     Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it.


     36  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

     Three Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with
     machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers. The two out-
     side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising
     a lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters
     pull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump
     from the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall,
     strong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and
     neatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE
     -- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache.

     He crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It
     is no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He
     walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and
     with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle.
     His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses.

                    KILGORE
               (bellowing)
          Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line
          back about a hundred yards -- give
          me some room to breathe.

     A Lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off.


     37  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

     He was not quite prepared for this.


     38  VIEW ON KILGORE

     turning to his GUARDS

                    KILGORE
          Bring me some cards.

                    GUARD
          Sir ?

                    KILGORE
          Body cards, you damn fool --
          cards !

     The soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new
     packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic. Two other
     soldiers get out of the copter and walk over. They are
     well-tanned and carry no weapons. They seem more casual
     about the Colonel than anyone else. The Sergeant walks
     up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance.

                    WILLARD
               (formally)
          Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th
          Recon Group -- I carry priority
          papers from Com-Sec Intelligence
          11 Corp -- I believe you understand
          the nature of my mission.

                    KILGORE
               (not looking up)
          Yeah -- Na Trang told me to
          expect you -- we'll see what we
          can do. Just stay out of my way
          till this is done, Captain.

     He cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the
     deck of new cards and fans them. The Colonel strides
     right past Willard with no further acknowledgement. The
     others follow,


     39  TRACKING VIEW

     The Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of
     devastation. Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore
     comes to each V.C. corpse he drops a playing card on
     it -- carefully picking out which card he uses.

                    KILGORE
               (to himself)
          Six a spades -- eight a hearts --
          Isn't one worth a Jack in this
          whole place.

     The Colonel goes on about this business.


     40  TRACKING ON KILGORE

     moving through the corpses, dropping the cards.

     On of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers
     something to him. He stops.

                    KILGORE
          What ? Here. You sure?

     The soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down
     the card he was holding. Kilgore strides over to the
     young man, who almost instinctively moves closer t
     Willard.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          What's your name, sailor ?

                    LANCE
          Gunner's Mate, Third Class --
          L. Johnson, sir.

                    KILGORE
          Lance Johnson? The surfer?

                    LANCE
          That's right, sir.

     Kilgore smiles -- sticks out his hand.

                    KILGORE
          It's an honor to meet you Lance.
          I've admired your nose-riding for
          years -- I like your cutback, too.
          I think you have the best cutback
          there is.

                    LANCE
          Thank you, sir.

                    KILGORE
          You can cut out the sir, Lance --
          I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy
          foot.


     41 VIEW ON WILLARD

     His entire, top priority  mission has been put in the
     background.

                    KILGORE (O.S.)
          This is Mike from San Diego and
          Johnny from Malibu -- they're good
          solid surfers -- none of us are
          anywhere near your class, though.

     Lance blushes, sort of mumbling thanks.

                    WILLARD
          My orders are from Com-Sec
          Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --

                    KILGORE
          Just hold up a second, Captain --
          I'll get to you soon enough --
          We've got things to do here.

     Willard eats it, for now. Kilgore puts his hand on
     Lance's shoulder, and continues flipping the cards in-
     discriminately on the bodies as they talk.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          ... we do a lot of surfing around
          here. Like to finish up operations
          early and fly down to Vung Tau for
          the evening glass. Have you ever
          surfed the point at Vung Tau? I
          liked the beach breaks around Na
          Trang a lot -- good lefts.

     He passes a twisted gun emplacement with about five
     bodies -- sprinkles cards all over them.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          ... we keep three boards in my
          Command Huey at all times. You
          never can tell when you're gonna
          run into something good. I got a
          guy in Cam Rau Bay that can predict
          a swell two days in advance. We
          try to work it in.

     He stops at a particularly wild-looking Viet Cong who
     has died with his mouth agape -- staring wild-eyed in
     horror at the sky. Kilgore pauses.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing; to himself)
          Hell, that's an Ace if I ever saw
          one.

     He puts the card in the gaping mouth.


     42  CLOSE VIEW OVER THE VIET CONG

     We SEE the Colonel and the others walk off -- the dead
     Viet Cong and card are in the immediate f.g. The card
     has the shield of the CAV printed bautifully, and above
     it the motto: DEATH FROM ABOVE.

                    KILGORE
          Where've you been riding, Lance?

                    LANCE
          I haven't surfed since I got here.

                    KILGORE
          That's terrible -- we'll change 
          that -- I'd like to see you work --
          I've always liked your cutback;
          got a hell of a left turn, too.

     43  EXT. THE HELICOPTER - MED. SHOT

     Willard is sitting with Kilgore on acouple of chairs by
     a table set up in front of the command copter.

     Everywhere we SEE armed men, sandbags, barbed wire, oil
     drums etc. Hueys are constantly ROARING over. ARTILLERY
     BOOMS in the far distance. Kilgore looks at the map.

                    KILGORE
          Why the hell you wanna go up
          to Nu Mung Ba for?

                    WILLARD
          I got bored in Saigon.

                    KILGORE
          What's the furthest you been
          in?

                    WILLARD
          Haiphong.

                    KILGORE
          Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?

                    WILLARD
          No. Walked.

                    KILGORE
          What'd you do for supplies?

                    WILLARD
               (he shrugs)
          Mercenaries -- agents, traitors --
          they put out caches.

                    KILGORE
          Can you trust them?

                    WILLARD
          No. They put out two or three
          for every one I needed. When
          you get to the one you'll use,
          you just stake it out. If
          something feels wrong, you just
          pass it up. On one mission, I
          had to pass up three and ended
          up living on rats and chocolate
           bars.

                    KILGORE
          Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter
          Kurtz commanded a Green Beret
          detachment at Nu Mung Ba.

                    WILLARD
          When did you hear?

                    KILGORE
          'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz
          still alive?

                    WILLARD
          Who knows.

                    KILGORE
          Seems to me he got himself
          fragged. i heard some grunt
          rolled a grenade in his tent.
          Maybe a rumor. Helluva man --
          remarkable officer. Walter
          Kurtz woulda been a General
          some day. General of the Army.
          Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs
          of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?

                    WILLARD
          I met him.

                    KILGORE
          Don't you agree?

                    WILLARD
          He musta changed !
               (pointing to the map)
          I got to get into the Nung
          River, here or here.

                    KILGORE
          That village you're pointing at
          is kinda hairy.

                    WILLARD
          Hairy ?

                    KILGORE
          I mean it's hairy -- they got some
          pretty heavy ordnance, boy --
          I've lost a few recon ships in
          there now and again.

                    WILLARD
          So? I heard you had a good bunch
          of killers here.

                    KILGORE
          And I don't intend to get some of
          them chewed up just to get your
          tub put in the mouth of the
          goddman Nung River. You say you
          don't know Kurtz?

                    WILLARD
          I met him.

                    KILGORE
          You talk like him. I don't
          mind taking casualties,
          Captain, but I like to keep
          my ratio ten to one in this
          unit -- ten Cong to one.

                    WILLARD
          You'll find enough Cong up there.

                    KILGORE
          What about this point here?

     He puts his finger on the map.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          What's the name of that goddamn
          village -- Vin Drin Dop or Lop; damn gook
          names all sound the same.

     He motions to one of his surfers.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          Mike, you know anything about
          the point at Vin Drip Drop?

                    MIKE
          Boss left.

                    KILGORE
          What do you mean?

                    MIKE
          It's really long left slide,
          breaks on the short side of the
          point -- catches a south swell.

                    LANCE
          Nice.

     Willard looks at Lance -- then at Kilgore.

                    KILGORE
          Why the hell didn't you tell me
          about that place -- a good left.
               (to Willard)
          There aren't any good left slides
          in this whole, shitty country.
          It's all goddamn beach break.

                    MIKE
          It's hairy ,though. That's
          where we lost McDonnel -- they
          shot the hell out of us. It's
          Charlie's point.

                    KILGORE
          How big it is?

                    MIKE
          Six to eight feet.

     Kilgore gazes out across the parked helicopters.

                    KILGORE
               (to himself)
          A six-foot left.

     Willard nudges Lance -- who gets the idea.

                    LANCE
          Boss. What's the wind like.

                    MIKE
          Light off shore -- really hollow.

                    WILLARD
          We could go in tomorrow at dawn
          -- there's always off-shore wind
          in the morning.

                    CHIEF
          The draft of that river might be
          too shallow on the point.

                    KILGORE
          Hell, we'll pick your boat up and
          lay it down like a baby, right
          where you want it. This is the
          Cav boy -- airmobile. I can
          take that point and hold it as
          long as I like -- and you can
          get anywhere you want up that
          river that suits you, Captain.
          Hell, a six foot left.
               (he turns to an advisor)
          You take a gunship back to division
          -- Mike, take Lance with you -- let
          him pick out a board, and bring me
          my Yater Spoon -- the eight six.

                    TOM
          I don't know, sir -- it's -- it's --

                    KILGORE
               (hard)
          What is it?

                    TOM
          Well, I mean it's hairy in there
          -- it's Charlie's point.

     Kilgore turns and looks to Willard, exasperated.

                    WILLARD
          Charlie don't surf.


     44  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS - DAWN

     What seems like hundreds of Hueys standing, their rotors
     churning a great wind -- Inside, the men of the 1st
     Cavalry Airmobile -- toughest unit in Vietnam.

     Kilgore's helicopter is being loaded with ammunition and
     has surfboards strapped underneath.


     45  MED. VIEW

     Kilgore strides up to the side door, dressed for battle.
     He looks out, around. He turns to his door GUNNER.

                    KILGORE
          How do you feel, boy?

                    GUNNER
          Like a mean motherfucker, sir.

     He turns to his R.T. man.

                    KILGORE
          Let's go.


     46  FULL VIEW

     Helicopter rotors build up speed -- gas turbines
     belching fire from their jet pipes -- dust flying
     as fifty helicopters rise; ROAR OVER CAMERA and
     deploy into attack formation.


     47  NEW VIEW

     Helicopters moving THROUGH the FRAME: almost a dance of
     dragonflies.


     48  INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD,
            OTHERS

     Willard looks ahead -- Kilgore sits near the door.
     Below they see the jungle whisk by and they are
     suddenly over the ocean, low and fast.


     49  MONTAGE

     CLOSE SHOTS of rocket pods -- mini-guns in bizarre
     looking mounts.

     CLOSE SHOTS of the three surfboards strapped below the
     command helicopter, next to the fearsome weaponry.

     And finally, CLOSE SHOTS of the men -- nervous, excited
     very few of them really scared -- they fondle their
     rifles, grenade launchers, anti-personnel grenades,
     claymore mines; plastic explosives cord; flame-throwers;
     M-60 machine guns; expandable rocket launchers; mortars
     and bayonets.


     50  INT. COMMAND COPTER

     Kilgore cranes his neck and almost leans out to watch
     the waves -- then he sits back relaxed.

                    KILGORE
               (to Willard)
          We'll come in low out of the rising
          sun -- We'll put on the music about 
          a mile out.

                    WILLARD
          Music?

                    KILGORE
          Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares
          the hell out of the slopes -- the
          boys love it.


     51  MED. SHOT

     POV behind the PILOT and CO-PILOT -- the ocean rushes

          Big Duke six to Eagle Thrust --
          turn on coordinates 1-0 -- niner,

     The helicopter banks into a tight turn and bears
     toward the coast.

                    RADIO (V.O.)

     52  CLOSE SHOT - LOUDSPEAKERS

     The ocean rushes below as suddenly the LOUDSPEAKERS
     BLARE out Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries."


     53  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

     From the water we SEE the massive grouping of Hueys -- gun-
     ships -- troop carriers -- medevac and recon -- ROAR over
     low in battle formation BLARING out "Ride of the Valkyries."

     The whole copter shakes.


     55  EXT. VIET CONG FISHING VILLAGE - FULL SHOT

     A Vietnamese coastal fishing village built along the
     beach and palm trees -- with rice paddies behind. This
     village commands a delta where ocean and river merge.

     Sampans are pulled into a cover where they are being
     unloaded. We SEE bunkers with N.V.A. regulars ambling
     about.

     Suddenly we HEAR the distant MUSIC -- Everyone stops;
     they stare out to see. Men scream orders -- women run
     from huts bearing ammunition and rifles -- Everywhere
     there is activity to prepare for the defense of the
     village.

     Camouflage is removed from anti-aircraft emplacements.
     People feverishly unlimber weapons of all types and run
     to tunnels and trenches.

     The MUSIC GROWS LOUDER with the FAINT SOUND of ROTORS

     59  EXT. HELICOPTERS - MONTAGE

     We SEE rockets ROAR from pods -- MACHINE GUNS RATTLE --
     grenade launchers POUND away -- and MINI-GUNS pour
     streams of lead and tracers with the SOUND of a DIESEL
     HORN.


     60  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

     POV behind lead gunship. They ROAR in over the beach
     streaming FIRE from doors, pods and nose -- The ground
     is alive with smoke and fire -- a hut EXPLODES. The
     leads ship banks sharply up over the trees -- men run
     below SHOOTING back.


     61  MED. SHOT - ANTI-AIRCRAFT EMPLACEMENT

     EXPLOSIONS crash around -- the MUSIC and SOUND of the
     COPTERS almost drown them out. The gunner FIRES
     frantically -- COPTERS are ROARING over -- GUNFIRE
     rips around. The gunner is blown away.


     62  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

     as the ship he is in swoops down, its MACHINE GUNS
     FIRING into the village.


     63  MED. SHOT - SWOOPING COPTER

     The Pilot leans out and SHOOTS a charging V.C. in the
     head with his .38, then ducks back in.

                    CO-PILOT
          We're down, Eagle Thrust -- we're
          hit. We got a hot L.Z. here.

     BULLETS RIP through the plexiglass. The Pilot FIRES
     back.

          Hell of a hot L.Z. Need immediate

               (continuing)
          Right along the doors, boy.

          Fine... fine... little higher.
          Through the roof; yeah, that's

     He leans back in.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          Didn't anybody bring me any
          bombs, grenades, claymores or
          anything?

                    LIEUTENANT
          You didn't tell me to, sir.

                    KILGORE
               (grumbling)
          You shoulda known.

     Suddenly, BULLETS SMASH through the copter -- Plexiglass
     SHATTERS; the copter vibrates and turns sharply. Kilgore
     is thrown down where he hangs on.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?

          Automatic weapons flashes along

          millimeter guns and AK-47's.

                    KILGORE
          The trees, eh...

     He grabs the R.T.

                    KILGORE

          Take her in low, Lieutenant.


     69  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, HELICOPTERS

     The two helicopters swoop up out of the smoke and blast
     the trees with ROCKETS, MACHINE GUNS and GRENADE LAUNCHERS.

     Other copters join -- The V.C. break and run through
     the rice paddies in the f.g. -- BULLETS EXPLODING around
     them -- they scream and fall FIRING back.


     70 INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD

     Kilgore looks out as three V.C. break and run through
     the rice paddies -- the helicopter turns and follows
     them -- the door gunner swings out and BLASTS two of
     them into the mud. He takes a bead on the third.

                    KILGORE
          Hold it, boy.

     He puts his arms across the sights -- the gunner swings
     back inside.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          Take her up to 300 feet,
          Lieutenant.

     They rise above the paddy -- the man below runs for
     all he's worth. Kilgore motions to the door gunner who
     steps aside. Kilgore buckles himself into the gunner's
     harness.

          My rifle, soldier.

     There is some fumbling and then a hand passes him a 300
     Weatherby Magnum with a zebra wood stock -- mother of pearl
     inlays and a variable power scope. Kilgore takes it and
     opens the bolt.

     73  MOVING POV. ON THE V.C.

     He is running hard, but starting to sink into the mud.
     The Huey DRONES overhead, its huge shadow behind him
     on the mud. He turns and FIRES with a pistol.


     74  INT. COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD

     Kilgore leans out; pulls the gun in tight -- takes
     careful aim and the Cong is BLASTED flat into the paddy.
     Kilgore leans back, opens the bolt, ejecting the spent
     cartridge out the door. He hands Weatherby back
     into the copter.

     The gaudy rifle passed by him.

     Somebody hands Willard the deck. He takes a card and
     flips it out of the copter, never lifting his gaze from
     Kilgore.

     trance and charge the Americans. The SHOOTING is at
     point blank range -- automatic, as the V.C. are cut
     down.


     77  INT. COMMAND COPTER - KILGORE, WILLARD, LANCE, ETC.

     Kilgore leans out carefully, looking over the battle-

          Let's get a look at it.

     Lance looks at Willard and then agrees.


     78  FULL SHOT - COPTER, SURF

     The pilots are used to this -- they bank sharply
     and swoop in on the lineup of waves, coming in  low
     over the point and streaking down a long, lined-up
     green wall as if surfing it. They tip up over and up
     at the last minute as the wave breaks.

     79  FULL SHOT - BEACH HUTS, SOLDIERS

     Americans line up blindfolded Viet Cong and N.V.A.
     regular troops outside a burning hut. GUNFIRE is
     DISTANT and sporadic -- an occasional MORTAR round
     SCREAMS in. A soldier yells in Vietnamese in a
     southern accent and the prisoners are marched away.
     Other soldiers are already setting up heavy weapons
     emplacements -- 50 cal machine guns etc. Three
     Hueys ROAR in, fanning the smoke with their wind.
     The center one, the command ship, lands. JETS SCREAM
     over and the two gunships pull up at 200 feet. Another
     Huey zooms in low and lands behind the Colonel's. The
     doors open, guards jump out, check the situation, and
     out steps Kilgore and Lance. From the other copter
     are more guards, Kilgore's surfers and others of the
     P.B.R. crew. Willard follows.


     80  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

     They stride out across the debris-strewn beach. Kilgore
     stands majestically on the point watching the waves. A
     SHELL SCREAMS overhead.

                    SOLDIER
          Incoming !

     They all dive, except Kilgore. He is watching a big set
     -- the SHELL EXPLODES in the water about a hundred yards
     away, sending up a huge geyser of spray. Kilgore is
     unmoved.

                    KILGORE
          Look at that.

     They look.

                    LANCE
          This  L.Z. is still pretty hot,
          sir, maybe we oughta stand
          somewhere else.

     Kilgore pays him no mention.

                    WILLARD
          I'm waiting for the fucking boat,
          Colonel.

                    KILGORE
               (without looking)
          It'll get here, soldier.

     He turns to Mike and Johnny who have their faces in the
     sand.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          Change.

                    MIKE
          Wh -- what?

                    KILGORE
          Change -- get out there -- I
          want'a see if it's ridable --
          change.

                    MIKE
          It's still pretty hairy, sir.

                    KILGORE
               (bellowing)
          You want'a surf, soldier?

     He nods yes meakly.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          That's good, boy, because it's
          either surf or fight.

     They turn and hurry off -- Kilgore grabs an M-1 from
     one of the guards. They all think he's going to
     shoot the surfers or someone. They move back uneasy.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          I'm gonna cover for 'em -- that's
          all.

     He cocks thye weapon. Lance looks around uneasily. The
     Colonel walks over.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          You think that section on the
           point is ridable, Lance?

                    LANCE
          I think we ought to wait for
          the tide to come in.

     A SHELL SCREAMS OVER -- they all hit the dirt except
     for Kilgore. It EXPLODES throwing sand through the
     air. Kilgore leans down yelling over the NOISE.

                    KILGORE
          Doesn't happen for six hours.

     Lance looks up at him terrified, holding onto
     his helmet.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          The tide -- doesn't come in for
          six hours.

                                   DISSOLVE TO :


     81  FULL SHOT - SURF - MIKE AND JOHNNY

     They walk through shallows carrying brightly
     colored boards. They look very scared. JETS SCREAM
     overhead, FIRING CANNONS. Helicopters wheel by
     carrying out wounded.

     They wear olive drab surfing trunks with the Cav's
     shield on the left leg. The same shield is emblazoned
     on the boards along the word "Airmobile". They edge
     into the water and paddle through the mild shorebreak.


     82  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

     They paddle up the point in the calm channel -- the
     beautiful waves breaking beyond them.

     83  CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY, MIKE

     They paddle on their stomachs, keeping low -- breathing
     hard and constantly looking around scared out of their
     minds.


     84  MED. SHOT - KILGORE AND LANCE

     Kilgore looks at them with his field glasses. Lance
     kind of sits below taking cover in a shell hole.

                    KILGORE
          They far enough?

                    LANCE
          Sure -- fine --

     Kilgore turns and takes a giant electric megaphone from
     a waiting lackey.

                    KILGORE
               (through megaphone)
          That's far enough -- pick one
          up and come on in --


     85  FULL SHOT - THE POINT, SURFERS

     They line themselves up on the point. A good set is
     building. Mike turns strokes into it -- takes off
     -- drops to the bottom and turns -- trims up into a
     tight section -- everything right except he keeps looking
     around frantically.


     86  CLOSE SHOT ON LANCE AND KILGORE

     Another SHELL SCREAMS over and EXPLODES down the beach.
     Lance looks over at Willard.

                    LANCE
               (to himself)
          Maybe he'll get tubed.

                    WILLARD
          What?

                    LANCE
          Maybe he'll get inside the tube --
          where -- where they can't see him.

     A SERIES of SHELLS ROAR in.
     
                    WILLARD
          Incoming !

     Lance ducks -- puts his hands over his head. The SHELLS
     SCREAM over Kilgore and out towards the point. Kilgore
     looks through his glasses -- two EXPLOSIONS in the water
     are HEARD.

                    KILGORE
          Son of a bitch.

     Lance looks up and out toward the point in horror.


     87  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

     Two surfboards float in the channel bobbing up and down
     on the waves.


     88  MED. SHOT - LANCE AND KILGORE

                    LANCE
               (to himself)
          The tragedy of this war is a
          dead surfer.

     Willard looks over, beginning to think Lance is crazy,
     too.

                    WILLARD
          What's that?

                    LANCE
          Just something I read in the
          Free Press.

                    KILGORE
          They just missed a good set --
          the chicken shits !

     Lance looks up.


     89 FULL SHOT - THE POINT , SURFERS

     They come up near their boards and climb on -- smoke
     hangs over the water.

                    KILGORE (O.S.)
               (megaphone)
          Try it again, you little bastards.


     90  BACK TO SCENE

     He turns to Willard.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          I´m not afraid to surf this place.
          I'll surf this place.


     91  CLOSE SHOT ON KILGORE

     He turns, glowering to his lackeys.

                    KILGORE
          Bring that R.T., soldier.

     He grabs it.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels --
          Goddamit, I want that treeline
          bombed -- yeah -- napalm --
          gimme some napalm -- son of a
          bitch -- yeah, I'll take H.Z.
          or C.B.U.'s if you got any of
          them -- just bomb 'em into the
          Stone Age, boy.

     He throws the R.T. back to a soldier -- another SALVO
     WHISTLES over -- everyone drops.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing; to himself)
          Son of a bitch.

     As the SHELLS EXPLODES on the beach behind him, KIlgore
     raises his M-16 and EMPTIES it full automatic in the
     general direction of the trees. He mumbles a few un-
     intelligible swear words and jams a new clip into his
     rifle turning to Lance --

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          We'll have this place cleaned up
          and ready for us in a jiffy, boy.
          Don't you worry.

     He FIRES another clip as the JETS SCREAM overhead.



     92  FULL SHOT - RIVER - COPTERS

     A sky-crane without pod descends slowly toward us --
     The P.B.R. hangs below it.

     The Chief, mr. Clean and Chef stand watching this sight
     alomg with other soldiers. A man guides the descending
     copter till the boat settles carefully in the shallows.
     The Chief and others leap aboard; unshackle the hoists
     -- load on ammunition and fuel. The battle is still
     going on around them. They all look up as a wadge
     of PHANTOMS streak over low and peel off one by one to
     begin their bombing run.


     93  FULL SHOT - PHANTOMS - MONTAGE

     Phantoms RAKE the trees with 20 mm CANNONS -- FIRE five
     inch ROCKETS in salvo -- "Bull Pup" MISSILES -- drop
     H.E. (high explosives) and C.B.U's (Cluster Bomb Units)
     and finally an immense amount of NAPALM.


     94  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

     The Chief is at the helm --the engine starts; Clean
     and Chef work feverishly, ducking for cover every-so-
     often when an EXPLOSION hits nearby. The boat begins
     to back out of the shallows. The EXPLOSIONS of NAPALM
     are reflected on their faces; the ROAR of the FIRE drowns
     out almost everything.

                    CHIEF
          Forget that extra drum -- it's
          too damn hot.

                    CLEAN
          Clear on starboard -- Where's
          Lance an' the Captain?

                    CHIEF
          I saw that Colonel's Huey on the
          point --

     Two HELICOPTERS SCREAM over FIRING ROCKETS.

                    CHIEF
               (continuing)
          Let's just get outta here.


     95  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - KILGORE, WILLARD , LANCE,
            OTHERS

     Kilgore watches the waves with his field glasses --
     smoke drifts over.

     Lance crouches below. Willard is up looking off in another
     direction. SHELLS SCREAM over, but even their noise is
     drowned out by the fierce SHRIEK of the PHANTOMS and the
     deafening BLAST of HIGH EXPLOSIVES. Willard stares at the
     tree line where it comes down to the river. The JETS are
     making a hell of the tree line; a hell of fire and bust-
     ling steam thet nothing could live in. Willard's glance
     goes further downriver through the black smoke and there
     merging in the river -- small and vulnerable, is his boat.

                    WILLARD
               (to Lance)
          Look. There it is; the boat.

     Lance looks over --  a tremendous relief on his face. But
     still there remains the threat of Kilgore, standing stark
     against the sky. Willard silently motions Lance toward
     the boat.

                    LANCE
               (whispers)
          He'll kill us.

                    WILLARD
          He can't kill us.
               (realizing as he says it)
          We're on his side.

     Kilgore FIRES another clip at the tree line, and then
     strides back without looking at them.

                    KILGORE
               (almost to himself)
          You smell that.
               (louder)
          You smell that?

                    LANCE
          What?

                    KILGORE
          Napalm, boy -- nothing else in
          the world smells like that --

     They reflect the glow from the burning trees.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing; nostalgically)
          I love the smell of napalm in
          the morning. 

          One time we had a hill bombed
          for 12 hours. I walked up it
          when it was all over; we didn't
          find one of 'em ... not one
          stinking gook body. They
          slipped out in the night -- but
          the smell -- that gasoline smell
          -- the whole hill -- it smelled
          like ...
               (pause)
          victory...

     He looks off nostalgically.

                    WILLARD
          You know, some day this war's
          gonna end..

                    KILGORE
               (sadly)
          Yes, I know.

     Suddenly he senses something -- he stops -- lifts his
     hand -- then frantically licks his fingers and puts
     them up in the air.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          The wind --

                    LANCE
          What?

     Sure enough there is a rushing breeze that increases.

                    KILGORE
               (rising maniacally)
          Feel it -- it's the wind -- it's
          blowing on shore -- It's on shore !

     He leans down and practically grabs Lance.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing; screaming)
          It's gonna blow this place out.
          It's gonna ruin it ...

                    WILLARD
          The kid can't ride sloppy waves.

     They turn and stare out to sea.


     96  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

     The wind has changed. Instead of blowing spray back
     over the waves and hollowing them out, this strange
     wind is causing white caps and cross chop.. reducing
     the swell to slop. Mike and Johnny lay low on their
     boards, overjoyed.

                    WILLARD (O.S.)
          The kid can't stand sloppy waves.


     97  MED. SHOT - THE BEACH - LANCE, KILGORE, WILLARD

                    WILLARD
          You don't expect this kid to
          ride that crap, do you? He's
          a goddamn artist, he needs
          something to work with...

     Slapping Lance on the shoulder.

                    LANCE
          Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !

                    KILGORE
               (apologetically)
          Yeah -- yeah, I can understand
          how you feel.

     He turns toward the trees.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing)
          It's the napalm -- it's causing
          the wind -- ruining my perfect
          left.

     He staggers off toward the trees followed by his
     guards and other lackeys.

                    KILGORE
               (continuing; mumbling)
          The napalm -- ruin -- napalm
          my perfect left -- my perfect
          left point break -- napalm --

     Lance motions with his eyes to Willard.


     98  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

     The P.B.R. along the river shallows -- The Chief and
     crew waiting and yelling.


     99  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD AND LANCE

                    WILLARD
          Are you finished surfing?

                    LANCE
          Yeah... thanks.

                    WILLARD
          Want to say goodbye to the
          Colonel?

                    LANCE
          Nah.

                    WILLARD
          Then let's get the hell out of
          here.

     They break and run like hell toward the boat in the
     distance. OUR VIEW TRACKS with them. They are
     cheered by the crew -- suddenly, Willard sees some-
     thing and stops... Lance continuing. In a pile of
     equipment that the Hueys have left are two surfboards
     -- Willard looks at them.

                    LANCE
          No -- no, Captain.

                    WILLARD
          Which one's the Colonel's?

                    LANCE
          The Yater -- the clear one
          with the thin stringer.

     Willard glances over to it with determination. There
     is still MORTAR FIRE coming in between him and the
     board. Suddenly, Willard makes a run for it.

                    CHIEF (O.S.)
          Incoming ! Incoming -- son of
          a bitch.

     The ROUNDS bracket the P.B.R. and line up the beach
     toward Willard. He stands there and doesn't move, the
     surfboard under his arm. The shells kick up sand.
     Lance has dropped. Fragments whistle by, one rips 
     a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the
     board.

                    WILLARD
               (calm)
          This one , Lance?

                    LANCE
          Yeah, Jesus Christ !

     Once again, Willard takes off fast as hell with the
     board under his arm. Lance follows toward the boat,
     through the water. Willard hands the board up to Mr.
     Clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and
     relieved.

                    CLEAN
          What'd you that for?

                    WILLARD
          When I was a kid I, never had
          a Yater spoon.

     Mr. Clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 Cal. mount.
     The boat turns -- ENGINES RUNNING HARD and ROARS OFF
     toward the deeper water of the river -- the board
     clearly visible on the stern.

                                   DISSOLVE TO :


     100  FULL SHOT ON THE RIVER - P.B.R

     The P.B.R. ROARS BY going down the river at full speed.
     It is swerving and zig-zagging to avoid potential enemy
     fire.


     101  MED. SHOT ON THE CREW

     They all are in full battle positions -- their twin
     fifty Cal. guns turning; warily covering the jungled
     banks. The Chief is at helm -- Willard crouches
     against some armor plate, huddled with his M-16 ready.
     Chef is behind him at the radio. Lance leans back
     from his forward turret.

                    LANCE
               (yelling)
          Maybe we better stay in under
          the trees till dark -- we got
          his Yater.

                    WILLARD
          He didn't look like he'd take
          that sitting down.

     They all look up into the sky -- expecting the worst.

                    WILLARD
               (continuing)
          Let's put some distance between
          us and Charlie.

     The Chief nods.

                    CHIEF
          Lance ---
     
                    LANCE
          Yeah.

                    CHIEF
          Why don't you roll us a big
          joint? I think the Captain'd
          like that.

     They all look at Willard uneasily. After a suspensful
     pause, Willard smiles:

                    WILLARD
          Take one a mine --

     He fishes into his breast pocket -- pulls out a huge
     cigar-sized joint. They all smile -- Willard lights
     up.

                                   DISSOLVE TO :


     102  FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R.

     It zig-zags away from us down the river at high speed.

                                   DISSOLVE TO :


     103  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, BOAT, CREW - NIGHT

     The boat is hidden under some trees along the river
     bank. The men wait tensely listening --

                    LANCE
          You hear it again?

                    WILLARD
          No -- I don't think so. But
          it'll be back. They were
          circling. It'll be back.

                    LANCE
          You think he'd of shot us?

                    WILLARD
          When?

                    LANCE
          Any time -- us -- Americans.

     Lance looks over at Willard.

                    WILLARD
          I don't think he´d of shot us on
          the beach but -- he'd of shot us
          if he saw me taking the board --

                    LANCE
          A Yater spoon is hard to get --
          especially here.

                    WILLARD
          He's a man who knows what he 
          wants -- he does know what he wants.

                    CHEF
          Can I go get those mangos now?

                    CHIEF
          I'll go with you in a while --
          judt hold tight awhile --

                    LANCE
          Captain -- that was all true
          about the rats and chocolate
          and stuff?

                    WILLARD
          Sure.

                    LANCE
          And you could just tell when
          the supplies were booby trapped?

                    WILLARD
          It's a feeling you get in the
          jungle. When you get good, you
          can find a track and tell not
          only how many they are, but
          their morale, how far they're
          going, whether they're near
          their camp, the weapons they're
          carrying.

                    CLEAN
          How can you tell their weapons..
          an' how far they're going?

     Willard smiles.

                    WILLARD
          Mostly from the imprints when they
          put them down to rest. their morale
          from the way they drag their feet,
          or the joints that may be lying
          around. If they're near a base
          camp, they wouldn't be conserving
          food; they'll be throwing it away
          half-eaten. If the branches aren't
          broken, their weapons are slung.
          But all this is just technique..
          There's a feeling you get after a
          while, that's what's important.
          I was going through a village once.
          I was looking for a certain party.
          I took off my boots, and walked
          into each hut. It was midnight.
          I went into three like that and
          suddenly I realized I´d gone into
          each hut the same way -- standing
          up -- so the next one I went in on
          my belly. An RPD burst took out
          the door a bit above my head.
               (he shrugs)
          Things like that.

     A pause, and then suddenly his attention is diverted --
     They all are silent -- It is pitch dark -- we HEAR the
     distant SOUND of ROTOR-BLADES and indistinguishable
     language on a loudspeaker -- The talk stops -- the
     ROTORS grow LOUDER until almost overhead.

                    KILGORE (V.O.)
               (over a loudspeaker)
          I'm not gonna hurt or harm you,
          boy -- I just want the board
          back -- You can understand --
          It was one of my best -- You
          know how hard it is to get a
          board you like, boy. I'm not
          gonna hurt or harm you --
          Just leave it where I can find
          it --

     The HELICOPTER DRONES on into the night -- the same
     speech starts again further off -- Finally the noise
     ceases.

                    CLEAN
          Jesus -- that guy's too damn
          much.

                    CHIEF
          I wonder if that was the same
          copter.

                    WILLARD
          He's probably got 'em all over
          the river with that recording.
          We better move now while it's
          dark.

     Chef steps forward with a plastic basket.

                    CHIEF
          Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take
          Lance with you --

                    WILLARD
          I'll go with him --

     They all look at him.

                    WILLARD
               (continuing)
          I wanta get my feet on solid land
          once in awhile --

     He grabs an M-16 and follows Chef over the side.


     104  MED. SHOT - THE JUNGLE - CHEF, WILLARD - NIGHT

     They cautiously walk through the underbrush.

                    WILLARD
          Chef.

                    CHEF
          Yes, sir --

                    WILLARD
          Why they call you that?

                    CHEF
          Call me what, sir?

                    WILLARD
          Chef -- is that 'cause you like
          mangoes an' stuff?

                    CHEF
          No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir
          -- I'm a sauciere --

                    WILLARD
          A sauciere --
     
                    CHEF
          That's right, sir -- I come from
          New Orleans -- I was raised to
          be a sauciere.. a great sauciere.
          We specialize in sauces; my whole
          family. It's what we do. I was
          supposed to go to Paris and study
          at the Escoffier School; I was
          saving the money. They called
          me for my physical so I figured
          the Navy had better food.

                    WILLARD
          What are you doing out here?

                    CHEF
          Cook school -- that did it.

                    WILLARD
          How?

                    CHEF
          They lined us all up in front of
          a hundred yards of prime rib --
          magnificent meat, beautifully
          marbled.. Then they started
          throwing it in these big
          cauldrons, all of it -- boiling.
          I looked in, an' it was turning
          gray. I couldn't stand it. I
          went into radio school.

     They move into a slight clearing.

                    WILLARD
               (whispering)
          -- quiet --

     Chef crouches close -- redies his M-16. Willard ges-
     tures that he heard something; he points.


     105  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE

     PAN SLOWLY over jungle -- END REVEALING Willard and Chef.

                    WILLARD
               (silent)
          There...

     He points -- motions Chef to move away -- they cover
     the spot. A few yards from them they hear something
     move. It is obviously no small jungle creature. They
     walk toward a patch of black elephant grass; their guns
     at the ready. They look at each other. Willard is
     cold, methodical, doing something he knows well. There
     is a noise again -- some of the growth rustles.  He
     and Chef move a distance apart, and join in stalking
     the probable V.C. Willard directs the Chef with hand
     gestures, and bird and cricket sounds. They move
     stealthily, closing the apex of their triangle on the
     hunted. The two men drop low into the elephant grass,
     and remain motionless. Then Willard makes the cricket
     noise, and they move closer. Willard's left hand edges
     out along the M-16's far end, so that he only has to
     point the finger of that hand and he will hit what he
     wants. He makes another command and they rush the
     trapped enemy.


     106  MED. SHOT - THE ELEPHANT GRASS - WILLARD AND CHEF

     Suddenly there is a RUSHING SOUND -- The grass folds
     down quickly toward them -- willard plants his feet and
     from the hip lets go FULL AUTOMATIC. The Chef retreats
     FIRING short BURSTS into the grass -- the grass folds
     almost to Willard -- then a huge tiger leaps out at
     them; snarling magnificently. They FIRE wildly,
     emptying their clips.

                    CHEF
          It's a motherfucking tiger --
          goddamn...

     He turns and bolts through the jungle, as scared as a
     man can be.

                    CHEF
               (continuing; screaming)
          Goddamn -- Jesus Christ tiger --
          motherfucking tiger -- ohhhhhhhhh --

     Willard jams another clip in his gun and backs out of
     the clearing, covering the bushes and runs, scared
     out of his head as well.


     107  FULL SHOT - THE BOAT - THE CREW

     They all are armed -- Lance has the twin 50's pointed into
     the jungle. Chef comes screaming out of the brush, throws
     his rifle into the boat and dives headfirst after it.

                    CHEF
               (hysterical)
          Ohhhh -- tiger ! Oh goddamn !
          It's a tiger ! Jesus Christ !
          Goddamn, a tiger ! Ohhhhhhhh.

     The Chief tries to grab him; takes his gun away, but is
     unable to take a hold of the Chef, as he slithers around
     the boat, trying to find safety. willard follows from the
     jungle -- The Chef is moaning and stares off into the night.

                    LANCE
          What's this tiger shit?

                    WILLARD
          No shit... I think I shot the
          hell out of him.

                    LANCE
          You think?

                    WILLARD
          I wasn´t looking.. I was running.

                    CLEAN
          Was a big tiger -- no shit?

                    WILLARD
          Who stopped to measure him -- let's
          get the hell out of here.

                    CHEF
          A motherfucking tiger -- I could've
          been killed.

     The ENGINE ROARS to life -- the P.B.R. pulls away with great
     speed.

                    CHIEF
          You forgot the mangoes, didn't
          you?

                    CHEF
          Mangoes? There as a fucking
          tiger in the woods -- I could've
          been eaten alive. I'm never
          going into that jungle again.
          I gotta remember never get out of
          the boat; never get outta the boat.

     They move off; swallowed by the darkness. The JUNGLE 
     NOISES remain, as OUR VIEW BEGINS a MOVE INTO the jungle.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          He was right, the Chef -- never
          go into the jungle, unless you're
          ready to go all the way.

     108  EXT. THE BOAT IN MARINA DEL RAY - NIGHT

     Willard, thinking, his BACK TO US. Suddenly, he turns
     around, and we SEE his face.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          What was in the jungle? What was
          there, waiting for me?

     He lights the cigarette; the light of his match illuminating
     his face momentarily. There is something different about
     him; a maturity, a cool inner peace.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
               (continuing)
          ... Kurtz was in there. Or was he;
          was it Kurtz? He was just a name
          to me now; I couldn't remember a
          face, a voice -- he just didn't
          add up to me. all his liberal
          bullshit about the end of savagery
          -- and the role of our culture,
          our way of life...

     Willard looks toward the group of people on the boat --
     there is still some MUSIC. They talk and drink and laugh.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
               (continuing)
          Our way of life -- I really
          started to look forward to
          meeting Kurtz again.

     The SONG BLARES ON -- they all dig it.

     PAN TO Willard, sitting alone in the rear, reading from
     his file on Kurtz. We REVEAL Lance in the b.g., water-
     skiing behind the P.B.R., slaloming back and forth on
     his single ski to the MUSIC -- jumping the wake occasion-
     ally.

     114  VIEW ON WILLARD

      Willard opens a letter from the packet.

     We can SEE it is a private correspondence -- feminine
     writing on the envelope.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          The dossier of A Dtachment
          contained letters from the families
          and wives of Kurtz' men There
          were letters from Kurtz' wife as
          well.


     115  CLOSE SHOT - ON THE LETTER

     It is addressed to Colonel Walter Kurtz -- in the corner
     is the return addess of Mrs. Colonel Walter Kurtz --
     Willard's hand fushes through the packet and comes up
     with apicture of a very attractive, thirty-five year
     old American Beauty... She is classically American.


     116  CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD
     
     looking at the picture -- puts it back, then opens the
     letter, straightens it.
           
                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          Dearest Walt -- I have to confess
          something. I know how you feel
          about this, but I had to ask Bob
          to find out what he could -- I
          just couldn't stand it anymore,
          not knowing where you are, whether
          you're alive or dead. I'm sorry
          Walt, I'm sorry I said that. Bob
          didn't tell me anything -- he said
          he couldn't -- I can't stand it
          anymore, Walt -- I just can't
          stand it.

     Willard looks out at the jungle.

     Deep imppenetrable jungle -- dark and primeval forests
     pass by. The Rolling Stones CHANT on in the b.g.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
               (continuing)
          I have to take the kids to school
          every morning now -- carpools just
          never work out.

          Jeff came home with a black eye
          on Tuesday but said he won anyway.
          He wouldn't tell me what the fight
          was about. Jeff keeps asking
          where you are -- he has maps of
          Viet Nam in his room now. He
          misses you very much. I can't
          take this much longer, Walt. I
          love you and I just can't stand
          it.


     117  CLOSE ON WILLARD

     He folds the letter up, files through some others quickly
     and gets to a peculiar envelope stamped Top Secret with
     a stenciled date on it. It is also noted that this was
     the last correspondence to leave Nu Mung Ba. It is
     addressed to Kurtz' wife. He opens the letter -- it is
     written in a scrawled savage hand to no one in partic-
     ular. It reads:

                         Sell the house
                         Sell the car

     The P.B.R. pulls in towards an American outpost that is
     being used as a forward medical evacuation center.
     Various helicopters pads are SEEN, but only one heli-
     copter -- the H-34 painted with Playboy rabbits that
     brought the girls to Hau Fat. Several soldiers in rain-
     coats come out the dock as the P.B.R. pulls up.


     120  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, SOLDIERS

     Willard looks into some empty tents -- looks around the
     dreary muddy camp. Two soldiers pass.

                    WILLARD 
          Soldier -- where'´s your C.O.?

                    SOLDIER
          Stepped on a booby trap, sir --
          got blown all to hell --

                    WILLARD 
          Well , who's in command here?

                    SOLDIER
          I don't know -- don't have any
          idea -- I'm just the night man --

     He turns and walks off babbling incoherently -- 

                    WILLARD 
          What about you, soldier?

     The soldier he was talking to turns around smiling
     idiotically and making animal noises. He stumbles off
     after his friend.


     121  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - WILLARD

     He looks around disgustedly

                    VOICE (O.S.)
               (whispering)
          Captain --

     Willard turns around looking for where the voice came
     from.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
               (continuing)
          Over here, Captain --

     He turns to see the Hollywood Agent under the flap of a
     large tent so that he won't get wet. He wears the same
     clothes as before, but is much dirtier. He motions
     Willard into the tent.


     122  INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, AGENT

     They duck inside -- it is dark and damp.

     On cots around astove sit the three playmates and the
     pilot. The nearest one, CATHY, a blonde, picks leeches
     out of her feet. The other two, TERRI and LYNDA, play
     cards with the helicopter pilot. Willard looks over 
     the situation.

                    AGENT
          You came in on that boat, didn't
          you?

                    WILLARD
          Yeah --

                    AGENT
          Where are you headed?

                    WILLARD 
          What's it matter? Get to the 
          point.

                    AGENT
          Look -- you know the girls --
          Thta's Terri -- she was playmate
          of --

                    WILLARD 
          Yeah, I caught your show at Hau
          Fat.

     They all look over.

                    AGENT
          Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this
          is Captain -- eh --

                    WILLARD 
          Captain Willard -- go ahead.

                    AGENT
          Look -- we got in a little trouble
          -- they rudely took our helicopter
          for MedEvac work on this -- uh
          Operation Brute Force -- They just
          brought it back this morning.

                    WILLARD 
          Yeah.

                    AGENT
          Well I mean like they also took
          our fuel -- We've been here two
          days.

                    WILLARD 
          Dreadful.

                    AGENT
          Look -- the girls could get
          killed -- we're not supposed to
          be this close combat, I mean
          real combat.

                    WILLARD 
          Well --

                    AGENT
          We could use some fuel -- just a
          half drum -- just enough to get
          us out a here.

                    WILLARD 
          We need all our fuel.

     He turns and starts to leave.

                    AGENT
          But, Captain, think what these
          girls have done for the boys --
          think of how they've risked --

     Willard is almost out of the tent.

                    TERRI
          Captain --

     He turns around.

                    TERRI
               (continuing)
          It's really rough here -- Captain
          -- we're just not built for it --

     The Pilot laughs.

                    PILOT
          That's rich --

                    TERRI
          Do us a favor -- I'd do one for
          you -- if I could --

     Willard just stares at her -- even though she's in jeans
     and field jacket she is something to see -- The Agent
     takes Willard aside -- Terri goes back to the others.

                    AGENT
          Look -- you know who that is,
          Captain -- you know what she's
          saying -- you'll never see stuff
          that good outside of a magazine
          for the rest of your life.

                    WILLARD 
          I'm not that fond of blondes --
          maybe I like brunettes --

                    AGENT
          Take your pick -- they all like
          you -- I can tell --

                    WILLARD
          I like all of them --

                    AGENT
          Good -- like I said, take your 
          pick.

                    WILLARD
          I said I like all of them.

                    AGENT
          Now just a second -- I'm doing
          you a favor, buddy -- what're you
          trying to pull?

     Willard turns to leave again.

                    WILLARD
          We need all our fuel anyway.

                    AGENT
          Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight
          -- what I meant was we'd need a
          whole drum for that --

                    WILLARD
          Sit down -- we'll talk about it.

     Willard sits down on a metal chair -- motions the Agent
     to do likewise.

                    AGENT
          What's there to talk about -- this
          whole thing disgusts me.

                    WILLARD
          My men --

                    AGENT
          What !

                    WILLARD
          That's what there is to talk 
          about -- my man -- I take a good
          care of my men --

     The girls are trying to pretend they're not listening --
     the helicopter Pilot is cackling to himself.

                    AGENT
          You're out of your skull --

                    WILLARD
          We have a lot of pride in our
          unit --

                    AGENT
          How far do you think you can
          push -- what kind of people do
          you think --

                    WILLARD
          Esprit de corps --
     
                    AGENT
          No -- absolutely not --

                    WILLARD
          One for all -- all for one --

                    AGENT
          You can keep your fucking fuel --

     Willard gets up.

                    WILLARD
          You make some of your closest
          friends in the army -- war has a
          way of bringing men together.

                    AGENT
          Get out --

                    WILLARD
          Men of all races -- nationalities --

     He gets up and starts out.

                    AGENT
          Two drums --

     Willard turns around slowly.

                    AGENT
               (continuing)
          Two whole drums --

                    WILLARD
          We can use some fifty caliber and
          a 16 too --

                    AGENT
          I don't know what you're talking
          about -- Get fucked --

                    WILLARD
          I will -- I assure you that --
          You got a fifty on that H-34 --
          leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll
          get my men to bring the first drum
          with 'em --

     He turns to go under the tent flap.

                    WILLARD
               (continuing)
          Have the girls freshen up a bit --
          comb their hair -- put on
          something -- you know what I mean --

     He leaves.


     123  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW

     They are all working on patching the boat and cleaning
     it up in general. Mr. Clean sits in f.g., cleaning an M-16.

                    CLEAN
          You keep this thing in this
          condition an' it's gonna jam,
          Lance -- mark my words.

                    LANCE
          Why don't you go pet the water
          buffaloes -- get off my back.

     Behins them on the beach stand several water buffaloes
     eating mud or whatever they do. They are painted jungle
     brown and green camouflage with grey bottoms -- on their
     sides the words have been stenciled in black:
               
                    1 Each --
                    Buffalo, Water B-1A
                    U.S. Army No. 15239

     Willard walks through them down to the boat.

                    CHIEF
          Careful,  Captain, they've been
          known to charge.

                    WILLARD
          All right I got a little surprise
          for you --

     They all look up.

                    WILLARD
               (continuing)
          I've arranged with those people
          we saw at Hau Fat to give us some
          50 caliber in trade for a couple
          a drums of fuel --

                    CHEF
          No shit.

                    WILLARD
          Chef -- since you're such a fan
          of Miss December's I think you
          should be detailed with Lance and
          Clean to take the first drum up
          there.

                    CHEF
          I don't believe you --

                    CHIEF
          What're you trying to say, Captain --

                    WILLARD
          You'll see soon enough -- get going,
          sailor --

                    CHIEF
          No shit -- hot damn --


     124  INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - LYNDA, CHEF

     He has followed her into the tent awe-struck -- she
     casuallu starts unbuttoning her fatigue jacket and taking
     off her pants. he just stands there, his arms at his
     sides.

                    CHEF
          I've got every one of your
          pictures -- I've got the
          centerfold -- the Playmate's
          review -- the Playmate of the
          Year run-off -- everything, even
          the calender --

                    LYNDA
          Well, get undressed and let's
          get it over with --

                    CHEF
          I can't believe it -- I'd a
          never even got to see you if it
          wasn't for this war --

     She lies down on the cot in only her panties.

                    CHEF 
               (continuing)
          You wouldn't mind -- uh kinda
          draping that jacket over you
          sort of the way you were in the
          calender, would you?

                    LYNDA
          Come on -- cut this crap -- I
          gotta get back to Saigon --

                    CHEF
          Just let me look awhile -- I just
          don't believe --

                                   CUT TO:


     125  INT. TENT - CLOSE SHOT - LANCE, CATHY

     They have just finished making love. cathy looks very
     pleased. Lance finishes tying his boots -- she draws on
     his back. He gets up -- starts to leave.

                    LANCE
          Well -- uh thanks -- see you around.

                    CATHY
          Yeah.

     He leaves -- she pulls herself up and starts combing her
     hair -- Mr. Clean walks in.

                    CATHY
               (continuing)
          Who are you?

                    CLEAN
          I'm next --

     She shrugs.

                                   DISSOLVE TO :


     126  INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, TERRI

     He finishes tying on his boots -- pulls on his jacket --
     his gun belt and picks up his M-16. She looks up at him --

                    WILLARD
          Ma'am -- I'd like to thank you for
          what you an' all your friends have
          done for us -- I want you to know
          that me an' the men appreciate
          you coming all this way -- riskin'
          your lives -- living uncomfortably
          an' doing all you can to entertain
          us. I want you to know personally,
          Miss, that for the past few minutes
          you have made me feel at home.

     She picks up a shoe to throw at him. he turns, exits f.g.

                    WILLARD
               (continuing)
          Just wanted to say that, ma'am.

     The SHOE CLANGS off his helmet.

                                   CUT TO:


     127  EXT. THE P.B.R. APPROACHING DO LUNG BRIDGE - FULL SHOT -
              NIGHT

     The boat edges in toward the wrecked bridge in the
     distance. Along the banks are sandbagged fortificvations
     with U.S. soldiers in them. There is a bright fire
     burning uncontrolled in the distance; the sparks and white
     light from welding on the bridge momentarily lights up the
     night.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          Two days and nights later, we
          approach the Do Lung Bridge.


     128  VIEW ON THE FACES OF THE P.B.R. CREW

     watching. Everywhere are wrecked boats -- parts of trunks
     sticking out of the water -- smashed helicopters on the
     banks. The bridge is in a state of siege. Mortars and
     rockets arc through the night indiscriminately and rip
     through the nearby jungle. Soldiers are everywhere --
     scurrying from trenches, carrying materials for the bridge
     or tending to the wounded, the maimed and the dead. Light
     automatic WEAPON FIRE is HEARD occasionally. The P.B.R.
     edges in under the span of the old bridge. Soldiers run
     up through the water. They are obscured in the darkness.

                    SOLDIER
          I gotta get out a here -- I´ll pay
          -- I got money.

                    CHIEF
          Get away from this boat.

                    WILLARD
          Who's your C.O., soldier?

     The Soldier ducks back and runs away.

                    SOLDIER
          Fuck you, you'll get what's coming 
          to you.

     Other men approach the boat. A young LIEUTENANT steps
     forward.

                    LIEUTENANT
          Captain Willard?

                    WILLARD
          That's me.

                    LIEUTENANT
          Captain Willard -- we got these
          from Nha Thrang two days ago --
          they expected you here then --

     He hands up a plastic bag, maximum security markings,
     Willard takes it.

                    LIEUTENANT
               (continuing)
          You don't know how happy that makes
          me, sir.

                    WILLARD
          Why?

                    LIEUTENANT
          Now I can get out a here -- if
          I can find a way out.

                    WILLARD
          We'll be needing some supplies
          and fuel -- do you know anybody
          who can give me a hand?

                    LIEUTENANT
          I'd just clear out as soon as I
          could if I were you, sir. They're
          gonna start working on the bridge
          with torches again. Charlie will
          start throwing it in hard --

                    WILLARD
          What is this bridge?

                    LIEUTENANT
          It's of strategic importance for
          keeping the highway into Bat Shan
          open -- the generals don't like to
          admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.

     He points to the men getting ready to work.

                    LIEUTENANT
               (continuing)
          Every night we build it and by
          0800 they've blown it up -- it
          and a lot of good men -- But the
          generals like to say the road is
          open -- ha ! Nobody uses that
          road except Charlie.

     He turns and splashes off into the darkness.

                    LIEUTENANT
               (continuing)
          This is the cesspool of hell.

                    SOLDIER (O.S.)
          Incoming.

     SHELLS WHISTLE OVER and CRASH into the bridge -- MEN SCREAM
     in the distance -- the EXPLOSIONS are thunderous.

                    CHIEF
               (yelling)
          All right -- Lance, go with the
          Captain an' see what you can
          scrounge --

     Willard climbs out with Lance.

                    CHIEF
               (continuing; to Willard)
          Better make it fast, sir -- we
          don't really need much anyway.

     Willard nods and they scurry off the bank under the
     bridge.


     129  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, LANCE

     They dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire
     on the edge of the road. SHELLS SCREAM overhead, they
     don't know where to run.

                    VOICE
          Straight ahead, son of a bitch.

     They dive towards the voice.


     130  CLOSE SHOT - TRENCH

     They dive in, a SOLDIER is crounched in f.g. holding his
     buddy who is crying uncontrollably.

                    SOLDIER
          You came right to it, son of
          a bitch --

                    WILLARD
          Son of a bitch, sir.

     The Soldier doesn't respond.

                    WILLARD
               (continuing)
          Where's your chief supply officer?

                    SOLDIER
          Beverly Hills --

                    WILLARD
          What?

                    SOLDIER
          Straight up the road -- a concrete
          bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where
          else you think he'd be?

                    WILLARD
          C'mon --

     There is an apparent lull and they dash out along the
     road. Suddenly to their right an M-60 STARTS OPENING UP
     from a sandbagged emplacement.

                    SOLDIER (O.S.)
          Get your asses down, buddy.

     They drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the
     emplacement. Several SOLDIERS man a M-60. One has a
     sniper rifle -- another tries to spot for the Gunner.
     Willard and Lance edge up along the trench. Willard
     trips.

                    VOICE
          Watch your feet, asshole --

     Willard looks down.

                    VOICE
               (continuing)
          You stepped on my face.

                    LANCE
          We thought you were dead.

                    VOICE
          The whole world loves a smart ass.

     They move ahead more carefully. The Gunner BLASTS away
     into the night, there is a pile of brass cases about three
     feet high next to him. Finally he stops swearing to
     himself.

                    WILLARD
          What're you shooting at, soldier?

                    GUNNER
          Gooks.

     He turns and sees it's an officer.

                    GUNNER
               (continuing)
          I´m sorry, sir.

                    WILLARD
          It's all right, sergeant -- what's
          out there?

                    GUNNER
          They were tryin' to cut through
          the wire -- I got 'em all I think.

                    OTHER SOLDIER
          Oh yeah -- listen.

     There is a low moaning SCREAM from out in the wire -- it
     stops for aminute then continues hideously.

                    GUNNER
          He's trying to call his friends --
          send up a flare.

     The Spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie
     light. The Gunner FIRES a long BURST.

                    SPOTTER
          Those are all dead, stupid, he's
          obviously underneath 'em --

     They think about this as the flare goes out. The SCREAMING
     gets more intense.

                    GUNNER
          Wake up the Roach.

     The Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is
     leaned up against the trench. He kicks him hard several
     times. Roach wakes and just looks up. On his helmet are
     the words: "GOD BLESS DOW."

                    ROACH
          Yeah, man.

                    SPOTTER
          Slope in the wire -- hear him.

     He listens, he does, he nods.

                    SPOTTER
               (continuing)
          Bust him.

     Roach gets up somewhat annoyed but very cool. He saunters
     up the machine gun dragging his M-79 which has paisley
     designs all over it.

                    GUNNER
          Hear him?

                    ROACH
          Sure , yeah.

                    GUNNER
          You need a flare --
               
                    ROACH
          No, it´s cool.

     He opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon and plunks
     the big slug into it. He snaps it closed then rests it
     across his forearm over the trench -- he listens to the
     SCREAM, calculating.

                    ROACH
               (continuing)
          He's close -- real close.

     He adjusts his sights so that the gun is aimed high into
     the air. He listens again then FIRES. The GRENADE
     WHISTLES off into the night. There is a sharp EXPLOSION
     that cuts off the scream. Then the THUD of bodies or
     pieces of bodies coming down around them.

                    ROACH
               (continuing)
          Muhhh Fuhhh ...
     
     He staggers back down the trench to go to sleep.


     131  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - BRIDGE - CLEAN, CHEF

     They stand in the shallows waiting for Willard and Lance.
     Clean is nervous, he constantly checks his M-16. SHELLS
     WHISTLE by and CRASH in the distance.

                    CHEF
          Geez, I wish they'd hurry.

     A SOLDIER comes up on his way with some others to start
     building the bridge.

                    SOLDIER
          Hey, buddy, that boat still runs,
          eh?

                    CLEAN
          Yeah, it still runs.

                    SOLDIER
          Do me a favor buddy, please.

                    CLEAN
          What is it?

     He takes out a handful of crumpled envelopes.

                    SOLDIER
          Send these out when you get back
          to the world.

     He puts them in Clean's hand.

                    SOLDIER
               (continuing)
          It's to everyone I really knew --
          the first girl I screwed -- my
          brother -- best friend -- I wanted
          to tell 'em how much I enjoyed
          knowing 'em -- it's been a great
          twenty years. I gotta let 'em
          know.

                    CLEAN
          What're you askin' me for -- put
          'em in the first helicopter comes
          in tomorrow.

                    SOLDIER
          Nobody comes in here.

     He points up at the mountain ridges.

                    SOLDIER
               (continuing)
          The N.V.A. 312th -- over there
          the 307th -- on that hill we
          counted fourteen different guns
          in one minute -- they got rockets
          mortars, snipers in those trees,
          there's a million of those shitty
          little bastards out there -- we're
          all gonna die.

     He grabs Clean and looks at him with a maniacal urgency.

                    SOLDIER
               (continuing)
          I'm gonna be dead.

     Clean takes the letters.

                    SOLDIER
               (continuing)
          You got a chance in that boat --
          by morning you could be five miles
          down the river.

                    CLEAN
          We ain't goin' down the river.

     The Soldier looks at him as if he is joking.

                    CLEAN
               (continuing)
          What's up river from here anyhow --

     The Soldier doesn't answer, just stares dumbfounded.

                    SOLDIER
          Spooky.

                    CLEAN
          Charlie?

                    SOLDIER
          No, it'd be spooky without the war
          -- give 'em back.

     He takes the letters and leaves, somewhat disappointed and
     disgusted. Willard and Lance come back down the beach
     carrying some belts of ammunition and a couple of extra
     M-16's.

                    CHIEF
          Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?

                    WILLARD
          We found some bodies -- let's get
          out a here.


     132  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - P.B.R.

     They edge through the shallows as the men light up their
     welding torches to start work on the pontoon bridge --
     then pull away and accelerate fast.


     133  MED. SHOT - THE P.B.R. CREW

     The Chief is at the helm --  they all look back in the
     distance where the bridge was -- the hills flash with
     artillery discharges -- there is a fiery glow from the
     bridge area and the CONCUSSION of heavy EXPLOSIONS.

     134  EXT. FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW - RAIN

     The boat moves uneasily upriver, through this tropical
     downpour. Mr. Clean is in thef.g., oiling and cleaning
     his 50-cal, his M-11 and M-79 -- the rest of the crew are
     forward, taking shelter from the rain under the canvas
     canopy. Clean works methodically under an umbrella he was
     set up by leaning the surfboard against gun mount.


     135  EXT. THE RUSHING RIVER - NEW VIEW - RAIN

     The river is moving fast against them. all manner of de-
     bris; tree trunks, sweeping by the P.B.R.

                    CHIEF
               (to Willard)
          I can't see a fucking thing.

     There is a loud CRACKING SOUND, as one of the pieces of
     tree- trunk whacks the hull, and bounces off. Willard
     climbs forward, and looks down.

                    CHIEF
               (continuing)
          We hit a big enough one this
          hull will shatter like a Corvette.
          Fucking plastic boat.

     Willard practically hangs off forward with a long pole,
     warding off the big debris moving toward the P.B.R. Clean
     joins him, helping.

                    WILLARD
               (shouting to Chief)
          What about ducking into one of
          those tributaries till this river
          slows down?

                    CHIEF
          Who knows what's up there?

                    WILLARD
          Can't be any worse than this.
          What do you think?

                    CHIEF
          I think this river wants to take
          us home fast. I'm practically
          goin' in reverse.

     Willard points his pole in the direction of the mouth
     of a tributary.

                    WILLARD
          Well, get in there.

                    CHIEF
          This whole area is lousy with
          V.C. -- We don't stand a chance.
          Lemme turn around and we'll be
          in Hau Fat in six minutes.

     There is a really loud WHACK against the hull. willard
     really mad, throws the pole at the Chief, who ducks.

                    WILLARD
          Get in there !

                    CHIEF
          This is my crew and my fucking
          boat, and I'm the responsible
          party.

                    WILLARD
          Get in there now or I'll bury
          you in this river.

     It's clear that Willard will kill the Chief if he doesn't
     do as he says.

                    CHIEF
               (finally relents, 
                 turns the helm)
          You're fucking crazy. You're
          going to get us all killed.

     The P.B.R. navigates through the rush and into the mouth
     of the tributary.

                    CHEF
          I don't know.

     He looks out -- the jungle at this point is very dark
     and high -- totally impenetrable.

                    WILLARD
          Keep cutting.

     They work feverishly, knowing something is wrong.

          Whatdoya think it thinks.

                    WILLARD
          That we're dumber than we look.

     Chef stops again, looks hard, trying to penetrate the
     darkness and from the very depth of it -- the darkness of
     it, comes a stream of tracers, lazily arching out at them.
     It whips between them -- the SOUND FOLLOWING much later.

     Other BULLETS SMASH through and ricochet off the deck
     fittings. GLASS SHATTERS, and a huge hunk of paint is
     removed from the armor shield by a 20 mm cannon.

                    CHIEF
          Lance -- 'bout twenty meters
          starboard.

     Lance leaps down to his position. Willard, Clean and Chef
     cut feverishly, as the trapped boat struggles to get free.

                    CHEF
          There in the trees !

     Everything is confusion -- yelling -- GUNFIRE -- the THUD

     143  CLOSE SHOT ON CLEAN


     144  POV BEHIND CLEAN

     He BLASTS short bursts of tracers into the jungle, cutting
     it to salad. Suddenly more tracers from another direction
     -- Clean swings around -- BULLETS smash against his shield
     and rip chunks from the surfboard. He BLASTS a long heavy
     burst at the jungle -- trees crumble.

                    CLEAN
          I'm ripping 'em, man, son-of-a-
          bitch, it's jammed, oh God,
          it's jammed.

     Clean is riddled by MACHINE GUN FIRE.

     Chief runs to Mr. Clean -- it is obvious that he is dead.
     He looks angrily to Willard.

     Willard and Chef are practically through. Willard leaps
     up, as Chef finishes the last strokes. He moves toward
     the cockpit.

                    WILLARD
          Throw me that ordnance.

     Chef throws him an M-79 and several shells -- Willard
     opens it, jams a huge projectile and pulls himself over
     the edge of the cockpit.

     be shot at.

     They smoke pot and eat silently. Lance smokes a

     of deck are ripped and ragged around the mount.
     The boat is a floating wreck.

     Clean's body is being prepared in a plastic sack

     water across the P.B.R.'s bow. The crew crouches, guns
     trained on the dock as the boat still approaches.

                    WILLARD
               (continuing)
          They're not Cong.

                    CHIEF
               (over the loud-hailer)
          We're Americans.

     Another BURST, closer.

                    CHEF
          Maybe you shouldn't say we're
          Americans?

     Willard stares at the dock and building, trying to figure
     it out.

                    WILLARD
          Chef, try your French.

     Chief hands the loud-hailer to Chef, who shrugs and shouts:

                    CHEF
          Nous sommes Americains --

     Silence.

                    CHEF
               (continuing)
          Nous ne voulon pas vous agresser.


     157  VIEW ON WILLARD

     He looks through the glasses.


     158  POV THROUGH THE GLASSES

     Gradually, a small group appears from behind the drums
     on the dock.

                    WILLARD (O.S.)
          French Nationals -- they may not
          be too friendly, though.


     159  BACK TO SCENE

     We drift closer to the dock. The Chef starts enjoying
     speaking French.

                    CHEF
          Nous sommes Americains -- nous
          sommes des amis --

     There is silence as the boat drifts closer. Then:

                    FRENCHMAN
               (shouting out)
          Vous parlez Francais comme une vache
          espanole.

                    CHEF
               (to himself)
          I thought it was pretty good,
          myself.

                    CHIEF
          What'd he say?

                    CHEF
          Said I speak French like a
          Spanish cow.

                    FRENCHMAN (O.S.)
          Laisser tomber vos armes --

                    CHEF
          Put the guns straight up -- stand
          away from the mounts.

                    WILLARD
          Do it.

     They do.

                    FRENCHMAN (O.S.)
          Vous pouvez approcher mais
          doucement --

                    CHEF
          Take her in slow.


     160  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - DOCK

     The men on the dock move forward, cautiously. They are
     a young man, PHILIPPE, about 25, strong and handsome, save
     for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left
     eye, which is covered by a patch. He is dressed in a
     tiger suit and the red beret of the French colonial para-
     troops. Also of the red beret are HENRY LeFEVRE, a bear-
     ded, dark-looking man of 35, and TRAN VAN KAC, a middle-
     aged half-breed slave. They all bear automatic weapons
     and suspicious in their eyes. As the boat pulls up to the
     dock, another Frenchman joins the group, obviously the
     head man, GASTON De MARAIS, about fifty, small and deli-
     cate, with a strength about him.

                    PHILIPPE
          Hands on the heads.

                    CHIEF
          I can't steer with my goddamn
          feet.

                    CHEF
          Hey, they speak American.

                    GASTON
          Who is the commanding officer?

                    CHIEF
          I --

                    WILLARD
          I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard.
          This is Chief Warrant Officer
          Phillips -- it's his boat. We
          were shot up bad downriver and
          need repairs and food -- we can
          pay you in gold.

                    GASTON
          Philippe --

     Philippe moves to another position -- Kac grabs the rope
     from the deck and ties it to the dock.

                    LANCE
          I'll help you with --

                    PHILIPPE
          Do not move --

     Gaston looks at the skyward pointed twin fifties admiringly.

                    GASTON
          Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --

                    WILLARD
          As I said, we can pay you in
          gold.

                    GASTON
          Entirely unnecessary, Captain.

     He puts down his gun -- the others do likewise --

                    GASTON
          We share a common enemy -- you
          are our guests.
               (he steps back)
          I am Gaston de marais -- this is
          my family's plantation. It has
          been such for 121 years. It will
          be such after I die.
          This is my son, Philippe -- he
          has fought in Algeria and held
          the rank of Captain. And Henry
          LeFevre -- a sergeant; he was
          at Dien Bien Phu. My personal
          servant, Tran Van Kac ---

     Then he motions to the trees. A young man in a tiger suit
     and three women come forward from different positions --
     all wear bush clothing and bear weapons.

                    GASTON
               (continuing)
          My youngest son -- Christian --


     161  CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTIAN

     He carries an M-60 machine gun in his hand -- a belt of
     ammunition trailing off behind him.

                    GASTON
          Christian's wife -- Ann-Marie --

     A tall girl, goodlooking, but severe -- she carries an
     M-16.

                    GASTON
               (continuing)
          And my youngest daughter --
          Claudine.


     162  CLOSE ON CLAUDINE

     an attractive girl about eighteen. She wears a red
     paratrooper beret and a well-fitted bush suit. She carries
     an M-79 grenade launcher and plenty of ammunition.


     163  FULL VIEW - P.B.R. - CREW, GASTON, OTHERS

     They stand there, exhausted and amazed. Philippe yells
     in Vietnamese -- about a dozen native men in tiger suits,
     heavily armed, walk out of the trees from all around them.
     They look the Americans over warily and assemble at
     Philippe's command.

                    WILLARD
          American weapons?

                    GASTON
          We took them from the dead.
               (smiles)
          Now -- I assume you want to rest,
          to shower. We'll attend to your
          repairs after dinner.

                    CHEF
          Shower.

     Willard's men look at one another, dazed.

                    WILLARD
          We don't want to bother you any,
          we --

                    GASTON
          A man of war is never bothered to 
          aid an ally -- you will follow me,
          Captain.

     Willard steps off -- then stops, reaches back and picks
     up his M-16 by the stock.

                    WILLARD
          A habit of men of war, sir --
          you understand.

                    GASTON
          Of course, Captain -- an
          unfortunate necessity.

     The men are relieved. They pick up their weapons and
     follow.

                    CHIEF
          What about the boat?

                    PHILIPPE
          My men will keep it for you --

                    CHIEF
          Yeah -- well, I'll stay with the
          boat.

                    WILLARD
          Chief.
               (pause)
          Come with us.

     They look at each other a moment. The Chief shrugs
     and follows.


     164  FULL SHOT - PLANTATION - WILLARD, GASTON, OTHERS

     Gaston stops, points to a guest house off the main struc-
     ture which is a typical jungle plantation house, save the
     many sandbagged gun emplacements and barbed wire.

                    GASTON
          A suitable accomodation for
          your men, captain -- you will,
          of course, be quartered with us --

     He indicates that the men should follow Philippe. The
     Chief is hesitant.

                    WILLARD
          Go ahead --

     Philippe leads them on, muttering.

                    GASTON
          Captain, this way.

     Willard follows -- they walk over past the house and toward
     the jungle, approaching a huge crater, 100 feet across and
     about thirty feet deep. The bottom is filled with water and
     young French and Vietnamese children swim in it. On the
     opposite rim, sit two men and a woman with machine guns.
     Gaston strides up and looks down at the crater with pride.

                    GASTON
               (continuing)
          Magnificent, eh, Captain?

     Willard looks.

                    GASTON
               (continuing)
          It is very good -- there is no
          current -- It is very good. I
          have never seen one like it in
          all Indochina. I was in Paris
          when it arrived -- do you know
          what might have caused --

                    WILLARD
          Looks like a two thousand pound
          to me. Yeah, a two thousand
          pound bomb.

                    GASTON
          No, I've seen those in Normandy.
          This is much better.
               (pause)
          My country -- my country could
          never originate this. Magnificent.

     Gaston stands in serious admiration for this feat; Willard
     looks between him and this big hole in the ground in
     amezement.


     165  INT. WORKMEN'S SHOWER - EVENING

     A foreman's shower from the old plantation days. The
     Chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted.
     Lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy,
     caked with blood. His reaction is odd; rather than just
     stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened,
     reluctant to step in. Chef is waiting behind him.

                    CHEF
          A hot shower, hot damn.

     He pushes him forward into the water. The dirt and
     caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and
     he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a
     shower is.


     166  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - EVENING

     battered and torn -- a few of Philippe's Vietnamese
     guard at the boat.


     167  INT. WILLARD'S QUARTERS - EVENING

     A beautiful European room with tall ceilings. Still
     elegantly furnished, although old and decaying.

     Willard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of
     the room, looking out over the carpet,  the bed with
     its elegant spread; the wash basin; the bidet. His
     battle dress is black with muck, with bloodstaines and
     burns.

     He rises from the chair and steps to a dresser above
     which is a large mirror. There is an album on the
     marble top of the dresser. He turns to a page at random.


     168  VIEW ON WILLARD

     haggard, looking down at the album.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          I wondered -- how long has this room
          been like this; how long has the
          furniture been standing in these
          places?


     169  VIEW ON THE ALBUM

     Some old photographs of people standing around a car
     in the 20's in front of the plantation. Another picture
     shows a child playing by the rubber trees near the
     plantation.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          Was it like this sixty years ago?
          Eighty years? But here, even
          eighty years is nothing.

     He turns the page,

     The plantation being built. Pictures of the framing,
     skeletal against the sky and jungle.


     170  VIEW ON WILLARD

     fascinated

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          It was jungle, once; and it will
          be jungle, again...


     171  VIEW ON THE ALBUM

     Onlu the very beginnings of the house; the first struc-
     tures. Then another picture of the jungle site where
     it was to be built.


     172  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

     He looks up and sees his own face, reflected in the garish
     mirror. He barely recognizes himself.


     173  MED. VIEW

     Willard looks at himself in the mirror, in this odd, out-
     of-time room.


     174  INT. DINING ROOM GROUP - TRACKING SHOT

     TRACK DOWN the long table, covered with delicious food.
     The P.B.R. crew sits with others of the De Marais group.
     The table is headed by St. LeFevre. Chef's face lights
     up as he regards the wonderful European-style food.

                    CHEF
          This food is wonderful ! I can't
          believe the chef is a slope.
              (turning to Clean)
          Some more?

     Opposite the table, sitting next to the Chief, Lance
     reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands.

                    CHEF
               (continuing)
          Hey -- Lance.

                    LANCE
          Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya ..
          wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni,
          please.

     And then he looks to his friends for approval.

     Our VIEW REVEALS that behind a transparent silk curtain
     there is another, more elaborate table, where the
     De Marais family is dining with Willard. Our VIEW MOVES
     through the curtain and settles in a MEDIUM VIEW of the
     group.

     The men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room.
     Willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair
     next to him.

                    GASTON
          Roxanne, I hope you are feeling
          better.

                    ROXANNE
          Je vais bien maintenant.

                    GASTON
          May I present Captain Willard?
          He is of a paratroop regiment.
          You know the difference between a
          paratrooper and a regular soldier,
          don't you , my dear?

                    ROXANNE
               (smiling and taking
                 Willard's hand)
          Yes, they come from the sky.

     She sits -- there's an uneasy silence.

     Willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of
     him, and the ongoing conversation on the other. He is
     forced to face toward Gaston, and drawn to look at Roxanne.

                    WILLARD
          I would like to know more about
          the .. uh, plaque...

     Philippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted
     wooden plaque with various tallies on it.

                    GASTON
          Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.
               (hard)
          This is only  for this war, Captain.
          Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese
          regular forces -- 15; South
          Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular
          forces and otherwise.
               (pause)
          Americain -- 6. Of course, they
          were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.

                    WILLARD
          Of course. I -- Once we make
          our repairs, we could send word,
          we could have you evacuated
          from here.

                    GASTON
          Captain?

                    WILLARD
          You'll get blown outta here some
          day.

                    GASTON
          We will never 'evacuate', Captain
          -- this is our home. Indochina is
          ours; it has been so for a hundred
          and twenty-one years, there is
          something to say for that.

                    WILLARD
          The Vietnamese think it's theirs
          -- I guess the Americans do,
          too.

                    GASTON
          But we civilized it. A place
          belongs to those who bring light
          to it, don't you agree.

                    WILLARD
          I always thought the French came
          here to get the rubber.

                    PHILIPPE
          Excuse me, I must attend to my
          men.

     He gets up, and leaves abruptely -- followed by his wife.

                    ROXANNE
          May I ask where the Captain is
          going in his little boat?

                    WILLARD
          We were going upriver when we
          got caught in a storm, ma'am.

                    GASTON
          Upriver? Why upriver? There is
          nothing there, only jungle.

                    WILLARD
          Do you know that jungle?

                    GASTON
          When I was a boy, my father would
          take me there, to hunt. There
          are a few savages, but no man
          can live there, no white man.

                    WILLARD
          What about an American named
          Kurtz?

     There is a pause.

                    GASTON
          We have never heard of him.

     Gaston rises, and takes Roxanne's hand.

                    GASTON
               (continuing)
          Bon nuit, Roxanne -- bon nuit,
          Captain.

     Willard turns.

                    WILLARD
          Good night.

     Gaston leaves. Willard and Roxanne are left alone. The
     servants clear the table.

                    ROXANNE
          You must realize, Captain -- we
          have lost much here -- I, my
          husband. Gaston -- his wife and
          son.

                    WILLARD
          I'm sorry to hear that.

                    ROXANNE
               (rising)
          Cognac?

                    WILLARD
          I should be checking on the
          boat.

                    ROXANNE
          The war will still be here
          tomorrow.

     She walks out of the room.

                    WILLARD
               (thinking)
          I guess so.

     He follows.


     175  INT. SITTING ROOM - FULL SHOT - WILLARD AND ROXANNE

     Roxanne sits, pouring a brandy, while Willard stands.

                    ROXANNE
          Do you miss your home, Captain?
          Have you someone there?

                    WILLARD
          No. Not really.
     
          I was discharged from the army
          four years ago. I went home,
          wasted some time, bought a Mustang
          Mach 1, drove it a week. Then
          I re-upped for another tour. No,
          everything I love is here.

                    ROXANNE
          Then you are like us.

     She reaches out to him; indicating that he sit.

                    ROXANNE
               (continuing)
          What will you do after the war?

                    WILLARD
          I just follow my footsteps, one
          at a time, trying to answer the
          little questions and staying away
          from the big ones.

                    ROXANNE
          What's a big question?

                    WILLARD
          Kurtz.
               (pause)
          I know you've heard of him.

                    ROXANNE
          Yes.

                    WILLARD
          What did you hear?

                    ROXANNE
          That strange things.. terrible
          things have occured around this
          American, Kurtz.

                    WILLARD
          What things?

                    ROXANNE
          Gaston would never tell me. It
          was asubject not to be spoken of,
          Captain.

                    WILLARD
          Yes.

                    ROXANNE
          Did you know -- deeper in the
          jungle, upriver -- there are
          savages?

                    WILLARD
          I know.

                    ROXANNE
          But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.

     A long pause. Then she looks at the cognac she poured for
     him.

                    ROXANNE
               (continuing)
          What a pity, you don't drink.
          Since my husband died, there
          are so many things I must do
          alone.

     She takes a sip.

     Willard moves to the French doors, which have been left
     partly open to let a breeze in. He steps onto a terrace
     overlooking the river.


     176  EXT. THE TERRACE - MED. VIEW - WILLARD - NIGHT

     A machine gun emplacement is situated on the terrace cover-
     ing the front of house, from the river.

                    ROXANNE
               (from the sitting room)
          Are you warm, Captain?

                    WILLARD
          The river is beautiful.

     In fact, we REALIZE that he is checking the boat.


     177  WILLARD'S POV.

     The P.B.R. is under guard by a couple of Gaston's
     Vietnamese.


     176  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

     She, thinking it romantic to talk about the river, comes
     up behind him.

                    ROXANNE
          I spend hours watching that
          river from my bedroom window.
          It fascinates me.

     She moves her body close to his; and, in a moment, he is
     kissing her.

     One eye steals another look at the P.B.R.

     Two of the guards leave -- two remain, getting ready
     for the long night.

     His hands wander over her body as she clings to him. Then
     she takes his hand, and leads him back into the sitting
     room, and up the stairs.


     182  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - FULL VIEW

     It is dark. She leads him into her room and closes the
     door. He stands there. In the center of the room is a
     large canopied bed with mosquito netting hanging down over
     it. The windows also have netting and barbed wire --
     there is a .30 calibre machine gun mount in the far one.
     He look around. she goes over to the bed, and turns
     down the sheets. Then she slips out of her dress and
     stands there facing him.

     He puts down his gun and strips off his shirt. She lays
     down on the bed and watches him.

                    ROXANNE
          I have been lonely here, Captain.

     He moves to her, slipping into the bed. M-16 is
     leaning against the wall in his reach.

                                   FADE OUT.


     183  EXT. ROXANNE'S TERRACE - NIGHT

     We can VIEW into the room, as Willard has silently
     slipped out of her bed, and is a dark sinister figure
     kneeling in final preparations for going out in the
     night.

     Without a sound, he comes out to the terrace, and
     scales down the wall of the old building, disappearing
     into the darkness.


     184  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - NIGHT

     Two Vietnamese guard the P.B.R. -- suddenly, feet first,
     the first disappears into the thicket.


     185  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

     in the thicket; we realize he has just killed the man with
     a knife. Willard stalks the second guard and makes quick
     work of him with his knife. He even enjoys it. Silently,
     he drags the body out of sight.


     186  MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

     The dark figure boards the boat silently. He disappears
     into the hold.


     187  NEW VIEW

     He lifts out several cases of supplies, working quickly,
     with a grace that indicates he is a man who has done his
     best work alone, and at night.

                                   CUT TO.


     188  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD - MORNING

     He sleeps soundly alone in the bed - we HEAR SOMEONE
     moving around in the room. He wakes suddenly -- PULL
     BACK TO REVEAL Roxanne combing her hair and buttoning up
     her blouse. She notices he is awake and smiles.

                    ROXANNE
          I will fix you breakfast.

     He starts to get up.

                    WILLARD
          I'm afraid I won't have time --
          I gotta --

                    ROXANNE
          Whe you reach the boat you will
          find that half your fifty calibre
          stores -- a case of grenades, a
          mortar and two M-16's and a
          case of clips are being
          transfered to us by your order.

     He stops -- seemingly stunned.

                    WILLARD
          So that's it.

                    ROXANNE
          You may think what you wish,
          Captain, but I like you very
          much.

     She turns to go.

                    WILLARD
          What if I say no.

                    ROXANNE
          Then Philippe will have to kill
          all of you.

     She leaves.


     189  EXT. DOCK - FULL SHOT - WILLARD, OTHERS

     He walks down onto the dock. Gaston's men are transferring
     ammunition boxes.

     Gaston is standing with Philippe, who are covering the
     Chief and crew with M-16's.

                    GASTON
          Two of my men deserted last
          night. It happens from time
          to time. I assume my daughter
          told you of our conditions.

                    WILLARD
          Your daughter.

                    CHIEF
          They taking half our ammo,
          Captain -- said it was your orders.

     He pauses for a second.

                    WILLARD
          That's right -- I did.

     The Chief spits in the water disgustedly and starts the
     engines. Willard looks hard at Gaston.

                    WILLARD
          I guess this is whAt men of war
          do -- eh?

                    GASTON
          We endure, captain -- you can
          blow up the house and we will
          live in the cellar -- destroy
          that and we'll dig a hole in the
          jungle and sleep on it. Burn
          the forest and we'll hide in
          the swamp. all the while, we
          do but one thing -- clean the
          blood off our bayonets.
               (pause)
          Au revoir, Captain.


     190  LONG SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R.

     Willard climbs on board and it pulls away.


     191  EXT. P.B.R. - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, CHIEF

     The BOAT ROARS out across the river. The Chief looks over
     at Willard. They stare at each other for a moment.

                    CHIEF
          Next time we  get in a good fire
          fight -- I'd like to know how
          she was, Captain.

     Willard just smiles at the Chief. he leans over and pulls
     up a floorboard -- the men stare in amezement; it contains
     the contents of all those ammo boxes.  .50 calibre; clips;
     grenades.

                    CHEF
          Holy shit.

                    CLEAN
          What did you put in all those
          ammo boxes?

                    WILLARD
          Rocks, sand -- those two men
          who deserted.

                    CHIEF
          When'd you do it?

                    WILLARD
          While you were sleeping.

     He lets the board drop.

     Willard moves to the back of the boat.


     192  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER , CREW

     The river has narrowed and runs swifter -- the water dark
     and deep. The trees are higher in this area and much of
     the river is shaded on one side. There is no undergrowth,
     just the tall trees and ferms. They move ahead at half
     speed, alert, ready for anything.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          We moved deeper and deeper into
          the jungle. It was very quiet
          there. It was like wandering on
          a prehistoric planet, an unknown
          world ... where the men thought
          they crawled to, I don't know.
          For me, we crawled toward Kurtz --
          exclusively.

     Willard looks out ahead and points.

     They all turn their guns in that direction. We PAN TO
     REVEAL a small village of huts along the bank.


     193  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - VILLAGE


     194  POV. OF THE P.B.R.

     They pass in front of the village which is rundown and
     completely deserted. The huts are on stilts to avoid the
     flooding of the river -- they are just skeletons of what
     they once were.

                    CHEF (O.S.)
          Flood.

                    CHIEF (O.S.)
          No -- most of 'em are still
          standing -- might've been
          disease.

                    WILLARD (O.S.)
          I don't know -- there'd still
          be some sign -- it's just like
          the one this morning.

     195  POV BOAT - FULL SHOT - JUNGLE

     The canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across
     the river filtering the sun. The forest itself has grown
     darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers. Strange
     birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes -- a huge
     snake slips along an overheading limb. The depth of the
     jungle is dark, ominous -- yet cool and strangely inviting.


     196  FULL SHOT - BOAT - JUNGLE

     Suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh
     and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls
     upon the boat. It is the shadow cast by an enormous
     vertical tail section of a B-52 bomber thrusting out from
     the mud. Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi-
     dizing in the sun. Creepers have already started to grow
     up around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it. But
     once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. A
     gateway to paradise.

     The river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and
     seductive. The hills beyond are purple and lush. Strange
     orange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way.
     The water itself is glass smooth and black as if there
     were no bottom. The sun is warm and the breeze gentle
     and laced with wild gardenians. It is indeed the most
     peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon
     it and has never known such a sense of peace and well-
     being.

     Each man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul
     cries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into
     hell.

     Here is all that can be had of earth. But no hand moves.
     The boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of
     the clearing. A hole into the jungle from which a
     darkness permeats. The boat follows the river into this
     hole.

     The skull looms in the f.g. -- the P.B.R. is pulled back
     about seventy yards -- Early morning mist still hangs on
     the water -- as it clears, we SEE another post and skulls
     on the opposite bank, It is strangely quiet.

                    CHIEF
          -- All right, Lance --

     Lance's TWIN FIFTIES split the silence as they POUR into
     the skulls on the opposite bank -- Suddenly there is a
     tremendous EXPLOSION and SECONDARY ONES from the jungle
     as shrapnel rips into the jungle and water from CLAYMORE
     MINES obviously set to cover the mound of skulls. The
     smoke clears.

          Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --

                    WILLARD
          Thta's not Charlie's work --

     There is silence.

                    WILLARD
          Whoever put'em there didn't do it
          to kill people -- They put 'em up
          as signs -- 

                    CHIEF
          Signs?

                    WILLARD
          Yeah -- like keep out --

     Willard motions -- the Chief accelerates -- they move ahead
     past the smoking mound.


     198  EXT. THE RIVER - FOG - DAY

     The P.B.R. pushed deeper into this mysterious area. Mist
     swells in and around the river, as the boat moves into
     an obscure fog. The Chief cuts the engine, and they coast.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          Toward the night of the fifth
          day out of Do Lung Bridge, we
          judged ourselves about eight
          miles from Kurtz' base.
          Everything was still, the trees,
          the creepers, even the brush
          seemed like it had been changed
          into some kind of stone. It was
          unnatural, like a trance. Not
          a sound could be heard. I began
          to think I was deaf -- then the
          fog came suddenly, and I was
          blind too.

     The boat disappears in the thick fog.

     They are silent. We can HEAR the most ominous SOUND
     COMING FROM THE BANKS. The GROANING, OR WAILING .. of
     HUNDREDS OF MEN.

          a half below Kurtz's camp. We

     Suddenly Chef lays out flat on the bow. Hundreds
     and hundreds of slender sticks fly onto the P.B.R.
     rattling against the boat.

                    CHIEF
          Shit ! Fucking arrows ! They're
          shooting fucking arrows at us.

     looking toward the banks.


     207  WILLARD'S POV

     Frags of men -- naked limbs, arms, breasts, glaring eyes
     entangled in the dense jungle gloom. And hundreds of
     pathetic wooden arrows flying out toward them.


     208 VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

     crazily zig-zagging up the river in the midst of the
     childish assault.

                    WILLARD
          Steer her right.


     209  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

     arrows hitting the deck. The men open up everything
     they've got. Lance is FIRING the two fifties wildly.
     
                    WILLARD
          Keep going.. keep going.
          They're just fucking sticks !
          Chief, stay at the helm.

     But Chief seems out of control -- he lets the clip of his
     M-16 go. Then slowly lets the rifle fall out of his hands,
     and falls to Willard's feet, a primitive spear having
     caught him right through the ribs. Willard looks down in
     horror.


     210  VIEW ON CHIEF

     laying at Willard's feet -- the long spear through him,
     bleeding onto Willard's boots. He looks up at Willard,
     about to say something.

                    CHIEF
          A spear?

     He dies.


     211 MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

     The men are still crazily FIRING into the empty jungle
     long after those who attacked beat their retreat.

                    WILLARD
          Stop it. Stop it !

     Slowly he pulls his boots from under Chief. They are
     absolutely soaked in blood. He is stunned -- sits down
     and begins to unlace the bloody boots, and take them off.

                    LANCE
          Chief's dead.

     Willard unlaces the other boot, and holds the bloody boot
     in his hand.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          It was the strangest thing --
          I don't know that I can explain
          it. Two of my men dead, and all
          I could think of was whether
          Kurtz was dead too. That's all
          I wanted: to see Kurtz, to hear
          Kurtz.

     He starts to wipe the blood off the boot.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
               (continuing)
          Somehow, in the middle of this ...
          carnival, Kurtz had grown into
          something -- a gifted officer;
          a great man.
          Somehow, he was the only light
          in this hopeless, hopeless
          darkness.
          And now I was too late --
          he was probably gone, disappeared...
          by a grenade rolled into his
          tent -- or by some spear on the head.
          Christ, I felt like howling like
          those animals in the fog.


     212  EXT. THE BOAT AT MARINA DEL REY - NIGHT

     The people at Charlie's cocktail party on the boat.
     Some flashbulbs are going off. Some people are dancing
     to the MUSIC. OUR VIEW MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD Willard, on
     the edge of the party.

                    WILLARD (V.O.)
          Here they are in Los Angeles.
          Everything is safe. There's a
          supermarket around the corner,
          the police station around the
          other. It would seem ridiculous
          to them that I was shot to hell
          because I had lost the privilege
          of listening to the mysterious
          Colonel Kurtz.
               (pause)
          Of course I was wrong. He was
          waiting for me. Kurtz was alive
          and he was waiting for me.

     213  EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. DAY

     The P.B.R. moving up the river. The men are practically
     in a trance now, looking at the banks of the river. They
     don´t even make an effort to touch their weapons.


     214  WHAT THEY SEE

     Hundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed
     in the most ornate and primitive manner: feathers, parts
     of birds and animals; cod-pieces -- all in body and face
     paint of the most savage nature. But there is a purity
     about them, men and boys, standing passively watching
     the small Navy craft flying the strange flag of red,
     white and blue.


     215  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

     The men of the crew are not the same men who began this
     voyage. Their manner is lifeless as though in a trance.
     The various decorations and paraphenelia that they have
     picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the
     savages that stand before them. The Chef has made a
     hat of birdfeathers; Lance's face has been painted with
     mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. He
     wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth.
     Their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the
     difficult journey. They start to move to their gun
     positions.

                    WILLARD
          Just stand here with me where
          they can see us. Do nothing.


     216  VIEW FROM BEHIND THE P.B.R.

     MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD the fantastic human wall of feathers
     and war paint, standing on canoes across the river. The
     men on the crew stand in a group, their hands visibly
     without weapons. The natives standing across the river
     make no hostile gestures as they approach. They accept
     the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi-
     tability. The boat moves closer, approaches the wall of
     feathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in
     almost a ritual of birth, undulating, allowing the little
     boat to penetrate.


     217  VIEW ON WILLARD

     Mus on his face (to protect it from the sun), the palms
     of some jungle vegetation protecting his head, he looks
     something like atribal chieftan himself. His intuition
     was right. He senses that they would be allowed to pass.


     218  FULL VIEW ON THE RIVER

     Hundreds of Montagnards who had been lining the river
     now run, absolutely silently, along the banks, keeping
     pace with the P.B.R. There is no hostility in these
     faces, only curiosity and a sort of grief.

     The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE once again and come upon an
     astonished sight, a black man dressed in a tatter of
     colored fabrics, feathers, and an Australian bush hat.
     He looks something like a multi-colored harlequin waving
     frantically to the P.B.R. The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE

     Willard shouts out to the starnge greeter.

                    WILLARD
          We've been attacked.

                    AUSTRALIAN
               (shouting back)
          I know, I know, it's all right.
          Come in this way. It's mined
          over there. This way. It's
          all right.

     Willard look at Chef who is at the helm. He shrugs and
     they do as this man says. The P.B.R. moves towards the
     water's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina
     wire. The odd Australian stands waving his hat, guiding
     them safely in.

     A thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the
     fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near
     the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub-
     merged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some
     of them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the
     ground. Chef nods at the bodies.

                    CHEF
          Charlie?

                    WILLARD
          Looks that way.

                    CHEF
               (looking at the Australian)
          Who's he?

                    WILLARD
          God knows.

     The boat pulls up. The Australian harlequin hops on
     board; the crew regards him with their dark faces splat-
     tered with mud and blood.

                    WILLARD
               (continuing)
          Who the hell are you?

                    AUSTRALIAN
          Moonby. Got any Winstons?

                    WILLARD
          Moonby what?

                    AUSTRALIAN
          Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal
          Australian Regiment, Task Force.
          Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.

                    WILLARD
              (incredulously, indicating
                the hundreds of natives)
          What is this?

                    MOONBY
          Oh, they're simple enough people.
          It's good to see you, baby.
          Nobody has any Winstons?

     Chef automatically offers Moonby a Winston.

                    MOONBY
          This boat's a mess.

                    WILLARD
          Where's Kurtz? I want to talk
          to him.

                    MOONBY
          Oh, you don't talk to Colonel
          Kurtz.
               (he puffs, then smiles)
          You listen to him. God, these
          are good. I kept these people
          off you, you know. It wasn't
          easy.

                    WILLARD
          Why did they attack us?

                    MOONBY
          Simple. They don't want him to
          go.

                    WILLARD
          You're Australian?

                    MOONBY
          Pre-Australian, actually. But
          I'd dig goin' to California.
          I'm California dreamin'.

                    WILLARD
                (almost to himself)
          So Kurtz is alive.

                    MOONBY
          Kurtz. I tell you, that man
          has enlarged my mind.

     He opens his arms wide, to indicate the breadth of his
     mind's expansion.

                    MOONBY
               (continuing)
          But lemme tell you, he is the
          most dangerous thing in every
          way that I've come on so far.
          He wanted to shoot me. The
          first thing he said is, 'I'm
          going to shoot you because you
          are a deserter.' I said I
          didn't desert from your army,
          I deserted from my army. He
          said, 'I'm going to shoot you
          just the same.'

                    WILLARD
          Why didn't he shoot you?

                    MOONBY
          I've asked myself that question.
          I said to myself, why didn't he
          shoot me? He didn't shoot me,
          because I had a stash like you
          wouldn't believe. I hid it in
          the jungle; the wealth of the
          Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish
          -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut
          Heroin; the Gold of the Golden
          Triangle. and Acid -- I make
          Koolaid that makes purple Owsley
          come on like piss. Now I'm
          Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen
          he talks. About everything !
          Everything. I forgot there's
          such a thing as sleep. Everything.
          Of love, too.

                    CHEF
          Love?

                    MOONBY
          Oh, no, not what you think...
          Cosmic love. He made me see
          things -- things, you know.

     The whole time Moonby is chattering on, Willard has
     picked up his field glasses and scans the fortress.


     226  WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH THE FIELD GLASSES

     Men in small groups, huddled over food.
     Now he settles on the entrance in the temple. There
     are stakes in front, and on top of them are horrible
     shrunken heads.


     227  BACK TO SCENE

                    WILLARD
          Sounds like he's gone crazy.

                    MOONBY
          No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be
          crazy -- if you heard him talk,
          just last week, you'd never think
          he was crazy.

                    WILLARD
          Is that where he is? By the 
          shrunken heads.

                    MOONBY
          Those heads, yes. Well, the
          rebels...

          Take us to him.

                    MOONBY
          Right on -- he's been waiting
          for --

                    WILLARD
          And shut up.

     Moonby nods and shrugs, and hops off the P.B.R. willard
     and the men follow.


     228  MOVING VIEW - WILLARD, MOONBY AND THE CREW

     As they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear
     where a moment before there was only jungle.

     They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking
     than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes
     and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted
     in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian
     AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women
     emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and
     equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them
     are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants
     of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is,
     if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS
     the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort,
     where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against
     the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more
     primitive and more savage than any since the time
     of Captain Cook.

     They encounter, in the center of the group, what once
     appears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt,
     wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a
     loincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke,
     strange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are
     long, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47
     decorated with scalps and human ears. Willard approaches
     this beast, who seems shy and retiring.

                    WILLARD
          Who are you?

                    MOONBY
               (breaking in)
          His name is...

                    WILLARD
          I'm not ever goin' to tell you
          to shut up again.

     Moonby shuts up. The MAN tries to speak, but nothing
     comes out. He is dumbstrucked at seeing them, as they
     are to see him.

                    MAN
          Colby. Exec. officer, A-Team...
          Special Forces. F-82 -- Col.
          Walter Kurtz, commanding.

                    WILLARD
          What happened here?

                    COLBY
          What -- happened here.

                    WILLARD
          Charlie?

                    COLBY
          NVA regulars. They're coming
          again tonight. Tet -- their
          big -- assault.

     Willard is the man in the middle -- he doesn't know what
     to say to this man, but he understands the forces that
     pounded him. He takes his arm.


     229  REVERSE ON COLBY

     looks at Willard, not understanding.


     230  REVERSE ON WILLARD

     Six months later, and he and Colby would be identical.

                    WILLARD
          I'm taking you back.

     Moonby slaps himself in the head with his hand.

                    MOONBY
          Oh, no, don´t say that.

                    COLBY
          Take us back. Take us back !
          But, the operation -- the team.
          Colonel Kurtz has such plans for
          -- the team.

                    WILLARD
          Take me to him, Major.

     Colby starts, and then, seeing the shrunken heads on
     poles, he turns, agitated, to Willard:

                    COLBY
          I had nothing to do with these
          operations -- I did not do the
          planning -- none of us did.
          It was all Colonel Kurtz -- he
          was the genius. You'll see --
          the genius of our Colonel. He
          should be made a General, don't
          you think? A General? It's...

     Suddenly, frightened, he stops. Without looking Willard
     knows that Kurtz is standing behind him. He turns.

     Kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is
     a powerful man, though obviously very ill. He slowly
     attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together,
     though it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with
     primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as
     well as his U.S.A. Colonel's insignia. He is feverish,
     with long blonde hair and beautiful features. His eyes
     almost hypnotize. His midsection is bandaged from what
     seems to be a serious wound.

     This is not what he expected. He is quiet, and then,
     automatically, he comes to an attention.

     looking at him a long time. Then he returns the salute,
     and simply:

          At ease...
               (pause, as he regards him)
          Sit down.

     There is, of course, no chair or anything like a chair.
     But behind and around him, Kurtz's men begin to sit on
     the ground, cross-legged. Finally, Willard sits as well.
     Then Kurtz does.

     Moonby lights a joint, and passes it respectfully to
     Kurtz -- throughout the scene, the joint is passed from
     man to man, ritualistically.

                    KURTZ
               (slowly)
          Why did you come to ... my province.

                    WILLARD
          We were attacked -- down river.
          We need supplies and medical 
          help.

                    KURTZ
          You were not coming here, to
          see me?

                    WILLARD
               (finding it more and 
                more difficult to go
                on with this lie)
          No -- no, sir.

                    KURTZ
          You came up my river -- in that
          small boat. So simple. I
          always thought the final justice
          would come from the sky, like
          we did.
               (pause)
          You are the final justice,
          aren't you?

                    WILLARD
          What do you mean, Colonel?

                    KURTZ
               (gently)
          What other reason could you
          have come? A Captain. Ranger.
          Paratrooper. Graduate of the
          Recondo School. Am I right
          about these things?

                    WILLARD
          You know you're right.

     There is a clear, incredible intelligence about this man.

                    KURTZ
          Then the Agency approached you.
          Maybe in a bar in Quinon or
          Pleiku. Simple. A year's pay
          for one life. Perhaps a village
          elder, or a tax collector.
          Nobody's orders but your own.
          Exciting work.


     235  CLOSE ON WILLARD

     He remains silent.


     236  CLOSE ON KURTZ

     He smiles.

                    KURTZ
          You've spent tome at the Royal
          Tracking School of Malaysia.
          I can tell from the way the
          laces on your boots are tied.
          I understand you, Captain. We
          understand each other.

     There is a long pause,  as the two men regard each other.
     Then Willard reaches to his holstered .45 -- withdraws
     it, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act
     assuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin.

                    WILLARD
          Do you know me?

                    KURTZ
          Yes.

     Kurtz reaches down; takes the .45 -- and without another
     word or gesture, shoots and kills a man.

                    KURTZ
                    (continuing)
          Do you know me ?

     He throws the .45 back on the dirt. Rises, and walks
     back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken
     heads. Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful
     distance behind. Even Willard is stunned.

                    CHEF
          Holy shit.


     237  EXT. KURTZ'S OUTPOST - FULL VIEW - TWILIGHT

     Dotted with campfires; Montagnard families -- it is like
     a primitive civilization.


     238  VIEW BY THE TEMPLE WALL

     Willard is alone by a campfire -- his M-16 leans by a wall
     next to him. He is exhausted.

     Lance sleeps by the fire, a little distance away. Chef
     approaches, crouches down.

                    CHEF
          Captain -- they've been probed
          all this week -- Cong and NVA
          regulars. There's gonna be a
          big offense any time.

                    WILLARD
          I know.

     Lance stirs; starts to wake up.

                    CHEF
          What are we doing here?

                    WILLARD
          Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him,
          just like he said.

                    KURTZ
          Yeah, I can see that. He's 
          fuckin nuts --

                    WILLARD
          Yeah.

                    CHEF
          He killed that guy without feeling
          anything.

                    WILLARD
          Not a thing.

                    CHEF
          When you kill Cong, don't you
          feel something.

                    WILLARD
          Sure.
               (thinking)
          Recoil... I feel the recoil of
          my rifle.

     Willard rises. Chef looks at him, confused and frightened.


     239  FULL SHOT - WALL - WILLARD, CHEF , LANCE

     Willard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged
     and dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar
     emplacement.

     Wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow
     to Willard as he passes.

                    WILLARD
          This is good -- triple overlapping
          fields of fire -- walls so thick
          ordinary artillery just cleans
          the moss off their surfaces.

     A woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then
     runs off to her bunker.

     WE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups
     of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and
     children. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from
     every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried
     scalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on
     a big piece of almost raw meat.

                    WILLARD
               (continuing)
          I've done things, when I was
          alone in the jungle -- that I
          never told anyone about.

     They continue past amount where the shattered wreck of
     half a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and
     fortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck
     lays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted
     there sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is
     built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of
     fire into the jungle beyond.

     Some Americans, barely recognizible because of their
     beards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several
     Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with
     bayonets.

                    CHEF
          This is evil -- evil, Captain.
          We're all gonna die here.

                    WILLARD
          Yeah, I know.

                    CHEF
          I don't get it -- You said your
          mission was to kill him. Let's
          do it, an' get our asses outta
          here. This  Kurtz is ruining the
          war; I mean, this don't look
          good for America !

                    WILLARD
               (lost in his thoughts)
          ... he's an amazing officer.

                    CHEF
          You got to kill this sonuvabitch
          -- Lance and me, we don'´t
          understand none of this -- Jesus,
          Captain -- I don't wanna die here
          -- Do it quick.

     Lance just stands there; his eyes vacant.. He sort of
     nods, sucking a joint.

                    WILLARD
          Yeah. I know.

     He thinks.


     240  INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

     VIEW FROM INSIDE -- Willard approaches the stakes with
     the shrunken heads. Chef and Lance with him. Willard
     steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting.


     241  WILLARD'S VIEW

     An austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head-
     quarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the
     ancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other
     military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards,
     but have now fallen into decayed disuse.

     There are other indications of the modern headquarters
     this had been. Now all those things are no longer impor-
     tant.  Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair.
     There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with
     maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically
     garbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil
     spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging
     fromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche
     "Nothing is true -- everything is permitted."

     Moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to
     Willard.

                    MOONBY
          He's asleep -- don't bother him.

                    KURTZ
          I'm awake.

     Willard steps in closer. Kurtz looks to Moonby.

                    KURTZ
               (continuing)
          You. Get out.

     Moonby hesitates -- not wanting to leave him alone with
     Willard.

                    KURTZ
               (continuing; suddenly)
          I said get the fuck out !
               (to himself)
          I'm going to kill the little
          weirdo myself tomorrow.
               (he shows some pain
                 when moving his
                 midsection)
          He´s only stayed alive this long
          because he's a good orderly and
          medic. He knows how to use a
          hypodermic.

                    WILLARD
          You're gonna get hit tonight,
          bad -- a whole regiment of NVA
          regulars.

                    KURTZ
          That's right, the little gook-
          pricks. But they are noble
          little gook-pricks, noble.
          Because they fight with their 
          guts, like animals. And for an
          idea ! That's rich. We fight
          with ingenious machines and
          fire, like Gods, and for nothing.
          But I'll call in a major blotto
          airstrike tonight. We'll have
          ourselves a helluva airstrike
          tonight, a lightshow. How do
          you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby
          Light My Fire...'

     Willard shrugs.

                    KURTZ
               (continuing)
          Do you?

                    WILLARD
          Yeah, I like it...

                    KURTZ
          I love it.

     He rests back, grinning.

                    WILLARD
          You've gone crazy.

                    KURTZ
               (angrily)
          No. My thinking is clear.
               (calmly)
          But my soul has gone mad.

     Suddenly Kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his
     stomach wound. He groans horribly, clutching at it. He
     literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor.

                    KURTZ
               (continuing)
          My gut -- Oh, Christ, my gut !

     Willard leans over him; checking the seriousness of the
     wound.


     242  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

     Lance is crouching by the stone entrance -- Chef leans in,
     witnessing the proceedings inside.

                    CHEF
               (muttering)
          Kill him -- come on, why don't
          you kill him


     243  INT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED, VIEW - KURTZ AND WILLARD -
              NIGHT

     Willard examining the wound.

                    KURTZ
               (in pain)
          Oh shit -- on the table; morphine.

     Willard moves to the table, opens the medical packet. He
     takes out a morphine capsule, leans over the writhing
     Kurtz and injects him with the drug.

                    KURTZ
               (continuing; looking
                 up in pain)
          You see how stupid it would have
          been to blow out my brains? I'm
          dying from the gut anyway.

     Willard quickly prepares another shot. Kurtz, truly
     frightened, holds up his hand.

                    KURTZ
               (continuing)
          No -- I don't want to sleep.
          I want to think. Water. Give
          me water.

                    WILLARD
          You can't have water after
          morphine.

                    KURTZ
          Still playing by the rules.
               (almost
                 affectionately)
          You're a damn good kiler.

                    WILLARD
               (still holding the
                 second morphine)
          How's the pain?

                    KURTZ
          How's yours?

                    WILLARD
          I can handle it.

                    KURTZ
          Pain is easy to handle -- but
          nobility.. the nobility of a
          man is judged by how much Truth
          he can handle.

                    WILLARD
          What Truth?

                    KURTZ
          The truth that you were sent
          here to murder me, ans so far
          you haven't done it. And do
          you know why?
               (looks at him)
          Yes, you know why.
               (he looks)
          Your mission makes about as much
          sense as those idiots who sent
          you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! 
          How long does it take you to
          figure out that nobody knows
          what they're doing here.
               (coldly)
          Except me.

     He rests back. The drug is beginning to take effect.

                    KURTZ
               (continuing)
          Gimme water.

                    WILLARD
          No water.

                    KURTZ
          You know what you're doing?
          You are interfering with my
          plans !

     He crawls in pain toward the canteen Willard watches
     him impassively.

                    KURTZ
               (continuing)
          This water's got Moonby's acid
          in it --

     He drinks sloppily from the canteen, water spilling all
     over. Then he throws the canteen to Willard.

                    KURTZ
               (continuing)
          Drink it -- drink it for tonight.
          Think of it. A whole regiment
          of those shitty little Cong --
          War. Total war -- war like you've
          never known it. It's beautiful
          -- you'll love it. Trust me.


     244  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED. VIEW - LANCE AND CHEF - NIGHT

     We can SEE into the headquarters: Kurtz offers the canteen
     to Willard. Chef is terrified -- Lance is stoned out.

                    CHEF
          Lance -- the fucker's not gonna
          do it.

                    KURTZ
          Goddamn -- You've gotta dig
          napalm on Speed, too. It's
          spectacular, you'll see.

     Lance stands up holding his M-16, looks into the cavern
     with Chef.


     245  INT. HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

     Willard stands there, holding the morphine needle in his
     hand.

                    KURTZ
          Look into the jungle. You can't --
          it's too terrible. You have to
          smear yourself with warpaint to
          look at it -- you have to be a
          cannibal.
               (whispered)
          That's why warpaint was invented.
          Then it becomes your jungle.

     Willard shoots himself in the arm with the morphine.

                    WILLARD
          How did we get here?

                    KURTZ
          Because of all the things we do,
          the thing we do best -- is lie.

                    WILLARD
          I think think a lie stinks.

                    KURTZ
          Oh Captain, that is so true.

                    WILLARD
          Stinks. I could never figure --
               (he drinks from
                 the canteen)
          I could never figure how they
          can teach boys how to bomb villages
          with napalm -- and not let them
          write the word 'fuck' on their
          airplanes.

     Willard drinks more of the LSD water.

                    KURTZ
               (angrily)
          You could never figure it because
          it doesn't make sense.

                    WILLARD
          Fuck no.

                    KURTZ
          I'll tell you what makes sense !
          Air strikes ! White Phosphorus !
          Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out
          of them if they don't do what
          we want.

                    WILLARD
          We'll exterminate the fuckers !

     Chef steps into the Headquarters -- he is terrified.
     He draws his bayonet.

                    CHEF
          Captain -- kill him.

                    KURTZ
          Think of it -- for years, millions
          of years, savages with pathetic
          painted faces were scared shitless
          that fire would rain down from
          the sky. And goddamn, we made
          it happen. God  bless  Dow  !

                    CHEF
          Kill him !

     Chef rushes at Kurtz with his bayonet -- instinctively,
     Willard GUNS him -- then there is additional automatic
     FIRE. Chef is being riddled by bullets.


     246  VIEW ON LANCE

     He has let loose with his M-16 at Chef, like some sort
     of mindless, programmed killer.

                    LANCE
               (FIRING)
          Hot damn !

     Then hes tops -- Chef falls to the dirt -- there is an
     instant of silence, then:


     247 EXT. OF THE TEMPLE AT NU MUNG BA - NIGHT

     The DOORS begin LIGHT MY FIRE , loud and overwhelming,
     as illuminating flares light up the blackness.


     248  MED. CLOSE VIEW

     of enormous loudspeakers protected behind spirals of
     razor-sharp concertina wire. LIGHT MY FIRE is blasted
     out to the enemy, poised to attack.


     249  ANOTHER LOUDSPEAKER

     Cannibal-painted men in savage decorations wait. Bay-
     onets are fixed. Men are stoned to acid, injecting
     speed, sniffing cocaine, eating grass, smoking hashish
     in water pipes. One looks up to the sky.


     250  EIS VIEW

     A rocket illuminates the sky, strobing, as in a psyche-
     delic hallucination.

          Wow...

     Another behind him is chanting the word NAPALM softly t
     himself.


     252  MED. VIEW ON THE GATE

     Willard strides out of the darkness, into the positions
     around the gate. He looks like a magnificent warrior --
     Genghis. All the men: Montagnards, fierce Americans,
     even the savage men of the P.B.R. crew either bow,
     salute or kneel before Willard. The color pulsates
     around the edge of the image, red and green, mauve and
     purple.

     We SEE Lance; waiting, with his weapons -- garlands of
     teeth around his neck, his face painted.

     Enemy ARTILLERY BLASTING away at the fortress.


     254  CLOSE SHOT - A MORTAR

     A hand drops a shell and it FIRES.


     255  CLOSE SHOT - ROCKET LAUNCHER

     It FIRES. EXPLOSIONS around the fort, red and orange
     and blue and green. They hit and grow, outward like some
     sort of cosmic flower.


     256  CLOSE SHOT - A FLAME-THROWER (ON TANK)

     Shoots out a stream of burning napalm that looks like a
     death ray gun, radiating outward with ice-blue energy.


     257  SHOT ON LOUDSPEAKERS

     blasting out music.


     258  MED. CLOSE VIEW ON YOUNG SOLDIERS

     With the MUSIC, like those people you see listening to
     radios in their cars.


     259  SHOT ON THE COMMAND BUNKER - WILLARD , KURTZ , OTHERS

     (In SLOW MOTION) Shells WHISTLE in and EXPLODE on the
     walls in the compound. The men behind them are setting
     up rocket launcher (missile) . Everywhere metal and rock
     and flame fly and it is beautiful to see.

     Willard looks through the infra-red sniper scope.


     260  WILLARD - INFRA-RED POV

     Strange, luminescent images of North Vietnamese approach-

          Mini-gun. Colby. Sergeant.
          Mini-gun.


     262  MED. SHOT - MINI-GUN

     A SERGEANT in feathered head-piece and wildly painted
     operates the mini-gun with several native helpers. SHELLS
     BURST  around them. When they FIRE the SOUND is incredibly
     loud and steady like a high-pitched foghorn. A solid
     stream of molten lead seems to pour into the darkness as
     7000 rounds a minute rip into the enemy. The pass of
     the lead reaches out in beautiful patterns as the Ser-
     geant sweeps the area. The sergeant laughs maniacally
     as the GUN resumes FIRING, right up to the moment he is
     blown to eternity by an all-engulfing 105mm shell.

     Colby pushes a row of plungers: Advancing NVAs il-

     beautiful, like a magnificent firework.

                    KURTZ
          Claymores, claymores.

     The SOUND DISTORTED of tremendous HOWLING EXPLOSIONS
     penetrate the track of LIGHT MY FIRE one after another.
     Kurtz's face is illuminated by each of these. His face
     seems to change from one grotesgue primitive face to
     another, as though the whole history mankind is evolv-
     ing in front of us.

     The SCREAMS of maimed and dismembered men almost pene-
     trates the INCREDIBLY LOUD MUSIC and we HEAR Kurtz's men
     LAUGHING and SCREAMING in delight.

     Kurtz looks out over the field of slaughter.


     265  FULL SHOT - NVA CHARGE

     through wires and claymore glass, each wilder and more
     extreme. They burn in the pools of luminescent napalm
     but press relentlessly on. SHELL BURSTS overhead. They
     chant to themselves as they advance. NVA have reached
     the walls and throw down scaling ladders and start up.
     Suddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce
     weird psychedelic light. Blared out at tremendous vol-
     ume over and above the DIN OF BATTLE is LIGHT MY FIRE.


     266  FULL SHOT - WALL - EVERYBODY

     The Americans and Montagnards stand up screaming.
     Spurred by MUSIC, they charge up. M-16's in both hands,
     blasting, kicking, bayoneting, gouging, splittin throats,
     biting necks, both sides collide in the utter and most
     horrible savagery.


     267  MED. SHOT - WILLARD

     standing on the wall BLASTING as bodies fall around him;
     he thrusts his bayonet into one attacker, removes it with
     a foot and stabs another. From him he takes his AK47 and
     BLASTS more as they come.


     268  MED. SHOT - LANCE

     The VC rush his position. Willard trips a claymore that
     BLASTS most of them to shreads. More fill in. Lance
     opens up FULL AUTOMATIC . Willard and Lance move down to
     the nest wall, FIRING , bodies tumbling over.

     Lance is caught in a CROSSFIRE and hit several times.
     He pulls himself up -- FIRES a final BURST and then falls
     under the enemy's feet.

          Code -- Street Gang -- Street
          Gang ! Purgative air strike;
          Street Gang !

     He turns and runs back through the compound with the
     receding Montagnards. SHELLS are EXPLODING everywhere.
     The light patterns are fantastic. Men fall, Viets break
     over the walls and charge. They crouch and rip into
     them FULL AUTOMATIC. They break the charge and continue
     cutting their way through the NVA masses like torches 
     through metal.


     271  FULL SHOT - COMMAND POST - KURTZ

     Kurtz watches as invaders swarm through his domain. Women
     and children rush upon him now. Kurtz flicks some switch-
     es and the whole north wall EXPLODES in overwhelming FIRE.
     The gates are uprooted. The stone lions tumble, crushing
     men below. Kurtz cocks an M-16 and walks off the bunker.


     272  VIEW ON WILLARD

     watching this spectacle.


     273  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - KURTZ

     He rounds  the shadow wall.

     Kurtz sees a group of Viets and rushes up and prepares a
     machine gun mount. They don't see him. He braces the gun
     at his side and steps out.

                    KURTZ
               (yelling)
          Charles !

     They stagger and fall, shattered and bleeding, save one
     who's merely lost his weapon. Kurtz looks at him, his
     gun empty. He drops it and flips open the flap of his
     holster. The Viet soldier goes for his pistol. Kurtz
     beats him to the draw and bloes him into the night. He
     moves over to pick up the NVA light machine gun. Holding
     it at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls
     and FIRES into the masses. His native men see him and
     rush for the chance to die beside him. They are quickly
     encircled by onrushing Viets and are being overrun. The
     machine gun jams and Kurtz grabs a rifle. When it's empty
     and the bayonet is off he wields it as a club.


     274  MED. SHOT - LOW ANGLE - KURTZ

     taking swings with his rifle, standing atop the
     wall and battering the oncoming enemy like Davy Crockett
     at the Alamo.


     275  FULL VIEW - THE FORTRESS

     The air strike hits with all its force. Balls and rain
     of fire sweeps down on the temple, the enemy, everything.
     It is the biggest firework show in history.

     The wall Kurtz was standing on, and he falls with it.
     Willard sees this and makes his way toward him as the
     air strike continues. All around us is a spectacle of
     MUSIC and light and fire and overwhelming color.


     276  TRACKING SHOT ON WILLARD

     following Kurtz's trail in the mud. He has crawled on
     all fours back into the jungle to die. He stalks Kurtz
     into the jungle ; moving around and cutting off the
     crawling Kurtz

                    KURTZ
          Go away -- hide yourself.

                    WILLARD
          What are you doing?

                    KURTZ
          Going back  - to the jungle to
          die.

                    WILLARD
          I'm taking you back. You can 
          still live.

                    KURTZ
          I had immense plans.

                    WILLARD
          I'm gonna get you out of here.

                    KURTZ
          I was on threshold of great 
          things.

     Willard slings Kurtz's bleeding body around his neck,
     holding his hand, dragging hom through the jungle. The
     spectacle continues in the b.g.


     277  EXT. THE P.B.R. - THE RIVER

     This wreck of a boat is still afloat. Willard crawls
     out of the jungle, carrying the dying Kurtz and manages
     to get him onto the boat.


     278  EXTREME FULL SHOT

     The spectacle of total psychedelic war: the fortress of
     Nu Mung Ba.

                                   FADE OUT.

     FADE IN.


     279  EXT. THE TEMPLE - MORNING

     The entire temple is devastation. Vultures by the hundreds
     circle overhead. There are a few survivors. Everywhere
     is smoke and heaps of bodies. Colby, a Sergeant, and
     some Montagnards sit near them.

     Their eyes are red and glazed, their jaws hang slack and
     they tumble occasionally. They stagger away from the
     field of slaughter. Willard looks down and sees something.
     Moves over to it, kicks several bodies away and in the
     f.g. below is Lance, dead.

     Colby stumbles over. Willard holds Lance up by his hair.

                    COLBY
          Who is he?

                    WILLARD
          He was the tragedy -- the tragedy
          of this war.

                                   CUT TO:


     280  THE P.B.R.

     battered, moving slowly down the river.


     281  TIGHTER VIEW

     Colby is at helm. Kurtz lies feverish, delirious.
     Willard sits by him. As the boat moves, Montagnards, those
     left alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks.
     Colby takes an automatic weapon and FIRES it into the air.
     Some of the natives move in terror, frightened of him.
     The battle is not over.

                    KURTZ
          Don't. Don't frighten them away.

     Willard looks down at him.

                    WILLARD
          So you understand this?

     Kurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his
     eyes. There is a slight smile.

                    KURTZ
          Do I not?


     282  EXT. RIVER - MED. VIEW

     The boat moves as though naturally carried by the river.

                    KURTZ
          My river... my people... my jungle...
          my ideas... my country...           
          my wife...

          ... my death.

                    WILLARD
          You had immense plans... immense plans...

                    KURTZ
          Yes...

                    WILLARD
          I'm taking you back.

     Kurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming
     intense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair. A whisper
     at some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry
     that is no more than a breath.

                    KURTZ
          The horror, the horror.

     We HEAR the distant SOUND of HELICOPTERS approaching.
     The SOUND of ROTORS in the distance. They look up,
     craning their eyes at the sky. Colby points.

                    COLBY
          There.

     Over the jungle mountains the small formation of MEDEVAC
     helicopters hooping toward them.

                    COLBY
               (continuing)
          How did they know?

                    WILLARD
          They must have seen the fire.

     The helicopters are closer now but high up. Two of
     them breaking off, spiraling in TOWARD US.

                    COLBY
          They're coming to rescue us.
          They're Medevac.

     He stares up at the sky.

          They're coming to take us back.

     Copters directly overhead.

                    WILLARD
               (continuing)
          Yeah.

                    COLBY
          Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.

                    WILLARD
          Yeah.

     He raises his M-16 and FIRES the entire clip at the ap-
     proaching rescue helicopter.


     284  FULL SHOT - THE COPTER

     It frantically pours on the power and wheels up to the
     sky.


     285  FULL SHOT - WILLARD, COLBY

                    WILLARD
          Yeah.

     Colby takes his rifle and joins Willard in FIRING at
     the retreating American helicopters.


     286  HELICOPTER'S POV - ON THE BOAT

          ... Don't remember a lot about my
          rehabilitation... but I was sent
          back to the world before the fall
          of Saigon...


     287  EXT. MARINA DEL RAY - EXTREME HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

     MOVING DOWN back to the pleasure boat at the Marina.

     Pause. Willard is very silent.

                    WILLARD
          I never answered questions about
          Kurtz -- I gave them a few of his
          unimportant papers -- but for the
          most part I saved everything.
          There were other letters, personal
          ones written earlier to his wife.
          I brought them to het. I watched
          the fall of Saigon on television
          in a bar in Alameda...


     289  EXT. CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

     A bright clear day in a scrubbed-clean California neigh-
     borhood. Some kids are playing in the street.

     Willard, years later, dressed as a civilian, proceeds past
     the lawn to the attractive home, carrying a packet under
     his arm. He passes a lanky, young teen-aged boy working
     on a motor-scooter. Willard looks at him. The boy
     looks back.

                    WILLARD
          Hi.

     Then the door opens, and KURTZ'S WIFE is standing at the
     door. She is still beautiful, blonde, and dressed in
     mourning even though she doesn't wear black. There is a
     sense of purity about her, though she is not young.

                    KURTZ'S WIFE
          Come in, Captain Willard.

     He enters.


     289  INT. KURTZ'S HOME - DAY

     Everything good and secure and desirable about America.

     She stands in the center of the room, a little nervous.

                    KURTZ'S WIFE
          Can I get anything for you?

     There are pictures of Kurtz, not too many... but he is
     there in the various stages of his career.

     Then she sits suddenly, and Willard sits by her.

                    KURTZ'S WIFE
               (continuing)
          Did you know him very well?

                    WILLARD
          You get to know each other pretty
          well out there.

                    KURTZ'S WIFE
          And you admired him?

                    WILLARD
          He was a remarkable man. It was
          impossible not to --

                    KURTZ'S WIFE
          Love him... Yes, it is true.
          That's the hard part for me... I
          knew him better than anyone ... I
          knew him best.

                    WILLARD
          You knew him best.

                    KURTZ'S WIFE
          You were his friend... You must
          have been, if he had given you
          this...
               (the packet)
          If he sent you to his home. He
          was the best this country had --
          he was --

                    WILLARD
          Yes, I know...

                    KURTZ'S WIFE
          I'll never get over it -- But
          I'll always remember him...

                    WILLARD
          Both of us...

                    KURTZ'S WIFE
          Men looked up to him...
               (she loses herself
                 in a thought)
          He died as he lived...

                    WILLARD
          His death was -- yes, he died as
          he lived.

                    KURTZ'S WIFE
          Were you with him, when...

                    WILLARD
          Yes I was... He said his last
          words to me.

     Pause.


     290  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD

     A little of the madness is still with him. He knows what
     she will ask.

                    KURTZ'S WIFE
          What were they?


     291  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON KURTZ'S WIFE

                    KURTZ'S WIFE

          The horror ! The horror !

                    WILLARD
          He spoke of you, ma'am.

     He sits there looking at her.


     293  EXT. TIGHT HIGH ANGLE ON THE MARINA DEL REY BOAT

     The cocktail party is breaking up. Willard is one of
     the few guests left.

     We MOVE FROM Willard standing alone on the deck of the
     boat. Moving back through the departing guests. Charlie
     is getting ready to leave himself. We MOVE CLOSER to
     Willard.

                                   DISSOLVE TO:


     294  EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. - DAY

     the boat floating down the river. Kurtz's body; an exhaust-
     ed, half-dead Colby. And HOLDING Kurtz, Willard. We HEAR
     THE DOORS' "THE END" as we present the END TITLES.

                                   FADE OUT.



                                       THE  END
