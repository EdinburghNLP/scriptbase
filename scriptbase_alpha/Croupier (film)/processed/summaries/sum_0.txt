Jack Manfred is an aspiring writer going nowhere fast.
To make ends meet, and against his better judgement, he takes a job as a croupier.
He finds himself drawn into the casino world and the job gradually takes over his life; his relationship with girlfriend Marion begins to deteriorate.
One gambler in particular catches his attention: Jani, whom he starts to see outside of working hours - a serious violation of casino rules.
Jani is down on her luck; under pressure from her creditors she approaches Jack, asking him to be the inside man for a planned heist at the casino.
Jack carefully considers the odds; it all looks so simple, but even a professional like Jack can't predict the cards he will be dealt.
