</b>
<b>               ESTABLISHING SHOT - EXTREME CLOSE - UP - COBBLESTONES - PARIS - 
</b><b>               EARLY MORNING
</b>
<b>               TITLE SEQUENCE BEGINS
</b>
               We OPEN with the screen filled with a dark gray, cut down 
               the middle by a black crevice. We should be unsure of what 
               we are looking at. Is it the surface of the moon or some 
               primeval canyon covered in volcanic ash? Just then a liquid 
               with a yellowish tinge finds its way down through the crevice 
               and further divides the screen in two, like a river border 
               dividing East from West perhaps.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal that the dark gray gulch 
               filled the screen was in fact two paving stones on a Parisian 
               street and the yellowish river that ran down the middle of 
               the stones comes in two tiny streams that lead to two little 
               boys, who are peeing on the pavement, laughing at their 
               mischief. The boys are twins. They wear backpacks and are 
               set to go off to school. Just then we HEAR the voice of a 
               WOMAN shouting in French (with English subtitles).

<b>                                     FRENCH WOMAN (O.S.)
</b>                         What do you think you're going?! You 
                         ought to be ashamed behaving like 
                         that!

               CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal ever more scenes of life 
               on this particular street. The woman shouts at the children 
               from her window and the children run off. At the corner, 
               fresh bread is being delivered to a sidewalk cafe, as chairs 
               are set out at tables by white aproned waiters who are 
               preparing for their morning clientele.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP to reveal a taxi driver arguing 
               with a deliver man as a husband kisses his wife goodbye and 
               set off for work as we continue pulling back and across the 
               city over Montmartre, picking up an argument between two 
               drivers here, fresh bread being delivered to a cafe over 
               there. Chairs are being set up at sidewalk tables as the 
               city awakens and we float across Montmartre into a small 
               residential quarter. Husbands kiss wives who send school 
               children on their way as TITLES CONTINUE and the city comes 
               more and more to life and we hover across a small square 
               just up from the Place de la Opera, not far from the Boulevard 
               Saint Germain-des-Pres, with Montmartre in the b.g. The square 
               has a sidewalk cafe with tables extending out onto a peninsula 
               of pavement that stretches to the foot of a small hotel, 
               whose shuttered windows overlook the square. As we pull back 
               and back over the small square, we literally...

<b>               SFX SHOT
</b>
               ...Pull backwards through the slats of the shutter, going 
               from an aerial shot, being sucked in through the semi-closed 
               shutters into a hotel room where we continue ever so slowly, 
               pulling back.

<b>               INT. HOTEL ROOM - PARIS - EARLY MORNING
</b>
               The first thing we SEE in this shot which should appear 
               seamless in its one continuous motion transition from the 
               preceding scene, is a spider-web. We are TIGHT on the web in 
               which a still-living insect struggles against his silky bonds. 
               The web begins to tremble as from up above the spider drops, 
               spinning thread lowering itself down on this latest victim, 
               soon to be lunch. As the spider makes this journey we become 
               aware in the b.g. of the panting sounds of lovemaking. It is 
               a woman's breathless sighs and gasps we hear, but under that, 
               perhaps a man's voice, perhaps not. The sounds build to a 
               climax as the camera continues to pull back until it discovers 
               the glistening body of a beautiful young Parisian woman in 
               post-coital dewy Nirvana. Then, the figure of a nude man in 
               silhouette enters frame and crosses over to the shuttered 
               window. His face and body are half-lit by the slats of light 
               that penetrate from the world outside the hotel room. He 
               lights a cigarette.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>               ANGLE ON - CLOSE ON THE MAN
</b>
               whom we will come to know as CARLOS. He lights the cigarette 
               and takes a thirsty drag sucking the smoke deep into his 
               lungs, glancing out at the street and alternately at the 
               spider who tiptoes down to her prey. He watches the spider 
               envelop the still-living victim with her spindly legs. Then 
               he takes another drag on the cigarette and the ash glows 
               bright, a burning ember which he touches ever so slowly to 
               the spider's body. It sizzles.

<b>                                     CARLOS
</b>                              (whispering to the 
                              burnt spider)
                         You lose...

               He looks out through the shutters at the digital clock across 
               the square. Then he glances back at the girl whom we will 
               call COLETTE. The conversation is in French with English 
               subtitles.

<b>                                     COLETTE
</b>                         What do you mean?

<b>                                     CARLOS
</b>                         I mean get out.

<b>                                     COLETTE
</b>                         You're a pig, you know that? How can 
                         you be like that?

               Carlos crosses to her slowly. He runs his hand across her 
               cheek, then down across her throat. Death is in his eyes.

<b>                                     CARLOS
</b>                              (barely above a whisper)
                         Leave without saying another word.

<b>               INT. BATHROOM - HOTEL - DAY
</b>
               Carlos stands in front of the mirror. The mirror is cracked 
               and in it we see the fractured face of Carlos staring back 
               at us from opposite sides of the cracked glass. He wears 
               surgical gloves. From a make up kit by the side of the sink 
               he removes a piece of false hair and spirit gum as TITLES 
<b>               CONTINUE.
</b>
               A. Carlos affixes a John Lennon mustache.

               B. Carlos puts on a brown wig of moderately longish hair 
               such as one might have seen on a student in Paris in the 
               early seventies.

               C. Carlos puts on a pair of John Lennon granny glasses and 
               the student look is complete.

               D. Carlos stands in front of a full length mirror in jeans 
               and a blue work shirt over which he puts a worn grey jacket. 
               He now looks every inch the young French student dressing 
               down to look like one of the proletariat.

<b>               END OF TITLES
</b>
               E. Carlos takes an M26 hand grenade and puts it into an inside 
               pocket of his coat. He puts a machine pistol and snaps its 
               ammo clip into it and puts it in his student's shoulder bag 
               and then takes a Walther PPK and places it in his jeans at 
               the small of his back. All the while that he is doing these 
               things he sings: "ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE."

<b>                                     CARLOS
</b>                              (singing)
                         All you need is love... 
                         Rum da, da da da 
                         All you need is love 
                         Rum da da da da 
                         All you need is lo-ve 
                         Love is all you need. 
                         Love is all you need.

               SUPERIMPOSED: Paris, September 15, 1974.

<b>               EXT. / INT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY
</b>
               It's a hot Sunday afternoon and the complex of shops and a 
               cafe in St. Germain-des-Pres is bustling with young clientele. 
               Inside the cafe, there is a second floor with a balustrade 
               overlooking the tables inside. Outside, there are tables set 
               up on the sidewalk.

               JACK SHAW, a tall, husky American in his late thirties, sits 
               at one of the front tables outside. He reads the International 
               Herald Tribune. The headline is, "Terrorists Seize Embassy, 
               Issue Demands And Threaten Attacks." Jack sips his espresso.

               dressed as in preceding scene. He enters. Just then Jack 
               looks up and sees him. For an instant, Carlos looks at Jack, 
               tenses just slightly. Jack looks back at his paper paying no 
               attention. Carlos pulls out a cigarette, pats his pockets 
               for a light. Then he crosses to Jack.

               He mimes flicking a match and Jack looks for a match. He's 
               out. He offers the lit end of his cigarette. Carlos cups 
               Jack's hand.

               He crosses away from Jack, smiling and goes inside the cafe. 
               Jack follows him absentmindedly, tracking his progress through 
               the windows, though his view is obscured somewhat by 
               reflections of the street. Carlos steps casually to the 
               railing overlooking the tables inside as Jack sees the double 
               image of Carlos and the reflected street scene. Carlos leans 
               over, pulls the pin from an M26 grenade, and lets the "spoon" 
               come off in his hand. We HEAR the timing fuse hiss as Carlos 
               nonchalantly counts to himself.

               He looks up just in time to see Carlos drop the grenade 
               casually into the crowd below. Their eyes lock for a beat; 
               then Carlos smiles, turns and bounds away. Jack's eyes widen 
               in horror. He gets up, about to cry out a warning.

               the crowd below as the grenade EXPLODES, filling the air 
               with smoke and flying glass, its metal ripping through flesh 
               and bone. People are wounded, bloody and writhing in pain 
               and screaming in panic.

</b>
               disheveled, covered with the shattered glass of the window, 
               but not but not seriously hurt, he struggles to his feet. He 
               looks around for Carlos who has vanished, now realizing who 
               he was. As he looks around, he sees a SMALL BOY staring at 
               his left arm with heart-rending disbelief.

               The boy has no hand.

               It's a cold Sunday morning with a light snow just beginning 
               to fall when SIX YOUNG MEN and ONE WOMAN enter the 
               headquarters of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
               Countries -- a modern, seven-story block of concrete and 
               glass. They all carry Adidas sport bags over their shoulders. 
               Their leader, Carlos, with dark beret and sunglasses, sports 
               a long white raincoat -- the kind that was very much in 
               fashion that winter. Next to him is KOJ, a Japanese terrorist 
               and his most trusted Lieutenant.

               The group with the Adidas sport bags approaches the reception 
               desk. Carlos -- moustache, sideburns, and wispy beard in 
               reddish brown -- smiles politely at the female RECEPTIONIST. 
               Behind the reception desk are two circular staircases which 
               wind their way up to an elevator that is visible behind the 
               railing at the top of the landing. There is what appears to 
               be a security man standing at that elevator with an earpiece 
               and tell-tale bulge under his jacket.

                         in progress?

               Smiling back, the ash-blonde receptionist nods.

               As if on urgent business, Carlos quickly heads up the flight 
               of stairs before the security man who stands next to the 
               receptionist can react. The security man speaks quickly into 
               his walkie talkie.

               by the elevator at the top of the stairs. Carlos bounds up 
               the stairs and pushes the elevator button. The Security Man 
               near the elevator listens intently to what is being said in 
               his earpiece and he steps forward to challenge Carlos. Carlos 
               smiles at him and whips out a 9mm. silenced Beretta and fires 
               two shots right between the Security Man's eyes. He falls 
               over the railing and lands face up on the console in front 
               of the terrified receptionist. Carlos leans over the rail in 
               one move and fires two shots into the upturned face of the 
               Security Man who stands next to the shocked receptionist. 
               The receptionist screams.

               short burst from Carlos' Beretta machine pistol which is 
               pulled from the inside of his trenchcoat brings them to the 
               floor. This weapon is not silenced, but deafening. Just then

               He reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a pocket-sized 
               Chinese RGD5 grenade. He yanks the pin, lets the spoon fly, 
               listens to the fuse hiss, counts quite calmly and then tosses 
               the live grenade to Koj who catches it and in one movement 
               tosses it out the door. A loud sound of GRENADE EXPLOSION, 
               and plaster powders those glued to the floor. GASPS OF TERROR.

               Mickens looks at him almost in horror. Jack knows he has let 
               down too much of the mask of professionalism as it were.

               Carl, Jack and various other CIA functionaries walk quickly 
               down the corridor with Austrian police and intelligence 
               officers. Jack carries a briefcase as do they all.

<b>               INT. MEN'S ROOM - VIENNA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT
</b>
               Jack stands inside of a stall in the men's room. He has just 
               crossed a certain frontier in his mind and stepped in to the 
               area known as no man's land. He quickly takes off his overcoat 
               and jacket and we SEE attached to his arm a harness made up 
               of straps and springs. He opens his briefcase and attaches 
               to the harness a .32 caliber Beretta. He fumbles with the 
               adjustments, racing against time. Finally, he seems to have 
               adjusted everything just so. Then he lowers his arm to his 
               side. Then he raises the right arm as if shaking hands and 
               the harness slams the .32 caliber Beretta from his forearm 
               straight into his palm.

               He resets the gun back into the forearm position. He has a 
               look of grim determination on his face. The only question 
               is, is it the look of someone who is crazy enough to do what 
               he is contemplating.

<b>               EXT. VIENNA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - BLIZZARD - NIGHT
</b>
               On the tarmac, an Austrian Airways DC9. TV cameras, lights, 
               generators are set up in front of the plane, sending beams 
               and pools of yellow light into the darkness and the snow 
               which swirls all around as a pool of REPORTERS stands ready 
               to record whatever is about to go down. Among a small group 
               of OFFICIALS is Jack Shaw. Everyone's eyes are on an 
               approaching yellow curtained bus.

<b>               ON BUS
</b>
               As it gets closer, we can detect through its windshield a 
               white raincoat and a black beret. Carlos is standing by the 
               driver with a machine-pistol in one hand and a grenade in 
               the other.

<b>               CLOSE - JACK
</b>
               His eyes strain to get a better look at the terrorist, his 
               arm down at his side.

<b>               BACK TO SCENE
</b>
               As the bus parks by the DC 9, Carlos jumps out and waves to 
               the media. Not the customary V-sign, but the wave of a 
               celebrity... The hostages then, under their captors' guns, 
               file compliantly out of the bus and onto the plane. A line 
               of exhausted, bleary-eyed middle-aged men in expensive suits 
               and in need of a shave. Carlos however, is as fresh, alert 
               and energetic as the morning of the attack. And he's 
               definitely savoring the moment.

<b>               ON JACK
</b>
               Tense, he tries to be inconspicuous as he leans towards 
               Mickens.

<b>                                     JACK
</b>                              (whispering)
                         I think it's him, but I can't be 
                         sure. Not with those dark glasses 
                         and the beard...

<b>               ON CARLOS
</b>
               Everyone on board, he too climbs the mobile steps and 
               disappears into the plane. Suddenly, he reemerges and comes 
               down to where the officials and Jack stand. As Jack watches 
               him intently, he faces the MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR. In the 
               window of the plane we SEE Koj holding a grenade to the 
               pilot's head.

<b>               ANGLE ON CARLOS
</b>
<b>                                     CARLOS
</b>                         Minister of the Interior, I 
                         presume...?

               The distinguished-looking man, who looks a bit like Kurt 
               Waldheim, nods.

<b>                                     CARLOS
</b>                         I'm sorry this had to happen in 
                         Austria. We have no quarrel with 
                         your government.

               His eye catching Jack, he stops in mid-sentence. A devilish 
               smile crosses his lips as he turns towards him. He pulls a 
               cigarette out and crosses right over to Jack, up close and 
               as they say, very personal. The snowflakes whirl 
               surrealistically around them as the two stand face to face.

<b>                                     CARLOS
</b>                         Pardon monsieur...

               He mimes flicking a match. He takes off his glasses and looks 
               at Jack and smiles.

<b>                                     CARLOS
</b>                         We were never really properly 
                         introduced Mister Shaw. My name is 
                         Carlos.

               With a cunning, mocking smile he extends his hand out to 
               shake Jack's. Jack stares at him, ever so slowly beginning 
               to raise his hand. With that move he knows the gun will come 
               slapping into his palm and he will be able to take Carlos 
               out no matter what the cost.

<b>                                     JACK

                         Eat shit and die slow.

               His hand starts rising. In another second the gun will spring 
               into it. Just then we hear:

<b>                                     MICKENA (O.S.)
</b>                         Jack, no!

               Jack turns to look at Mickens. Mickens indicates the 
               photographers.

<b>                                     MICKENA
</b>                         You don't want your picture taken 
                         shaking his hand.

               Jack is momentarily confused. He has turned to Mickens 
               thinking perhaps he was calling out a warning and now the 
               moment for the shot has passed. He turns back to Carlos who 
               shrugs and steps over to the Austrian minister so that the 
               Minister now is between Jack and Carlos and the shot is lost.

<b>                                     CARLOS
</b>                              (to the minister)
                         As I was saying, I'm sorry about the 
                         loss of life. And thank you for your 
                         cooperation.

               Once again he sticks out his hand. Only this time, as the 
               cameras roll, Austria's Minister of the Interior shakes the 
               hand of the archterrorist in what will go down in history as 
               the "handshake of shame."

<b>               ON JACK
</b>
               His eyes tell it all.

<b>               EXT. JERUSALEM - WESTERN WALL - DAY
</b>
               We begin with an ESTABLISHING SHOT of Al Aksa Mosque and the 
               Mosque of Omar in Jerusalem. These are the two most famous 
               landmarks in Jerusalem's Old City skyline.

               CAMERA then pans and tilts down and we are above the Western 
               Wall looking down on the bobbing black hats of Hassidic Jews, 
               the knitted skullcaps of more modern Orthodox, here and there 
               the olive shirt of Army uniform with M16 or Galil assault 
               rifle that sways in prayer as well.

               To the Jerusalem stone paving stones that make up the square 
               in front of the wall as we glide across the intersecting 
               lines of paving stones set one next to the other until a 
               glowing cigarette comes into view and then a foot which 
               crushes it out. There should be something in this sequence 
               that is reminiscent of our opening, a foreboding that just 
               as the cracks in the Parisian paving stones led us to Carlos 
               once before, perhaps these new stones will lead us once again 
               to some act of terror.

<b>               NEW ANGLE
</b>
               to reveal a man standing in silhouette, the man who has just 
               crushed out the cigarette. We cannot see his face because he 
               has a camera to his eye.

<b>               NEW ANGLE - POV THROUGH THE CAMERA LENS
</b>
               Through the lens of the camera just established we SEE an 
               old Rabbi praying at the wall. CLICK! The shutter captures 
               the shot.

<b>               BACK TO SCENE
</b>
               The man in silhouette now lowers the camera and we SEE that 
               he is CARLOS! There is no mistake even though the nose, 
               perhaps is a little different and this time he is clean-
               shaven, it is still Carlos the Jackals. He smiles slightly.

<b>               EXT. CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE
</b>
               Busy photographing it, Carlos doesn't seem to notice the TWO 
               ARABS who watch him surreptitiously. He walks in front of 
               soldiers who laugh and look at us POV Carlos.

<b>               ANGLE
</b>
               Carlos reaches into his pocket. Is he perhaps going for a 
               grenade to toss at these soldiers? We build tension as he 
               pulls out instead, another roll of film and with great 
               determination, we have the CLICK of the door of the camera 
               to enhance our music beat as tension builds. Surely it can't 
               be long till Carlos does something awful.

<b>               EXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY
</b>
               Carlos walks towards the Suq, working his way through the 
               crown from the Damascus gate as we reveal more soldiers in 
               the foreground, surveilling the area.

<b>               EXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY
</b>
               From the POV of the two Arabs following him, we SEE Carlos 
               lost, or pretending to be, as he ambles along through the 
               Suq, past all sorts of vendors hawking their wares. Heads of 
               fish are cut off with the swift slash of a knife in one stall, 
               freshly skinned lambs hang by their feet in another. Carlos, 
               still looking lost, approaches a street vendor hawking rosary 
               beads. We SEE them talk but cannot hear their dialogue.

               Carlos walks on.

<b>               EXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY

               A group of children play an impromptu game of soccer.

</b>
               It is Carlos who has taken the picture. His smile at the 
               sight of the children is no longer a subtle one. There is 
               some secret enjoyment here.

               It's then, that he notices the Two Arabs tailing him.

<b>               CLOSE ON - CARLOS
</b>
               He frowns.

               Now what happens can be interpreted in one of two ways. Carlos 
               takes a turn down an alleyway that has at first a shop or 
               two, and then is nothing but deserted and foreboding alley. 
               He is either trying to shake the two Arabs or he has just 
               entered every tourist's nightmare: a deserted alley in a 
               foreign country with two bad guys. He quickens his pace. The 
               Arabs do too. Carlos now knows they're after him and he takes 
               off running.

<b>               EXT. MOSLEM QUARTER - DAY - CHASE SEQUENCE ANGLE
</b>
               So do the two Arabs. Only now there are THREE MORE ARABS 
               coming after him.

<b>               MOVING
</b>
               A tense, desperate CHASE in the Moslem Quarter's labyrinth 
               of twisted alleys and narrow streets. When his Arab pursuers 
               lose sight of him briefly, Carlos takes something out of his 
               pocket, some sort of ID and throws it in an alleyway.

<b>               EXT. SUQ - JERUSALEM - DAY
</b>
               Carlos races through the Suq, past a group of Arabs who begin 
               heeding the call to prayer. They roll out prayer mats and 
               begin acclaiming in Arabic that there is only one God and 
               Mohammed is his prophet. Carlos grabs one of the canvas 
               awnings that shade the alleyways and this cafe. He rips it 
               off, trying to make an obstacle course between him and his 
               pursuers. He overturns trays of olives, sacks of sunflower 
               seeds, anything he can get his hands on.

<b>               NEW ANGLE
</b>
               Carlos runs headlong into a copper serving platter that is 
               hanging on display. He is disoriented, terrified, and then 
               seemingly from out of nowhere, he is tackled, grabbed by the 
               Arabs and dragged to a dark alley between two stores. Carlos 
               is overcome and brought down to the ground. One of the Arabs 
               evidently has a deep dislike for Carlos and though Carlos is 
               subdued, he kicks the shit out of him.

               in Damascus. There is no way of knowing. It is simply an 
               empty room with a large metal ring embedded into the floor, 
               to which Carlos is shackled. Battered and badly bruised, 
               he's obviously in great pain. The room's metal door SCREECHES 
               as it opens slowly and a new man whom we will call AMOS 
               enters. With him are two of the Arabs we've seen earlier. 
               They're bareheaded now, without their kaffiyehs.

               others like tourists. As inconspicuously as possible, they

               front of Jack, spread out on the desk is a file on Ramirez. 
               We SEE it as Jack does. Notes on the interrogation, Polaroid 
               photos of Ramirez in custory and the developed pictures from 
               the roll of film which Ramirez was taking in Jerusalem. Jack 
               listens to Scott and Monroe, but as he does he is taking in 
               all the information in Ramirez's file, making no judgments, 
               just taking in information.

               on Annibal Ramirez, resplendent in his summer whites, his 
               face still showing the faintest remnants of bruises at the 
               hands of the Israelis. He holds his sea bag in his hand. 
               There is a waiting taxi behind him as he strides over towards 
               the baseball diamond.

               He sees his father just as the batter hits the ball.

               The pitcher scoops the grounder up and tosses it to Joey 
               whose eyes however have lit up at the sight of his sailor 
               father home from the sea so the ball hits him in the side of 
               the head and he goes down. Ramirez wants to rush out to his 
               son, but Joey straightens himself up quickly, not wanting to 
               be embarrassed by an over-protective parent.

               Maura has followed her son's gaze at Ramirez and feels no 
               embarrassment whatsoever as she runs into his arms, still 
               holding her baby. She kisses him.

               Ramirez holds Yolanda. Ramirez and Jack speak quietly.

               Jack chuckles.

</b>                         Commander Ramirez when I said I was

                         have been more specific. I'm from 
                         the CIA.

               Jack reaches down, opens his briefcase and pulls out a large 
               photo album-like briefing book. He opens it up and hands it 
               to Ramirez. On the first page there is an 8×10 enlargement 
               of a photo of Carlos entering a building. It is grainy but 
               it certainly looks exactly like Ramirez.

</b>                         Does the man in that picture look 
                         familiar?

               Ramirez looks at the picture with the same look on his face 
               that Jack had when he saw Ramirez for the first time.

</b>                         It's... this Carlos guy.

               Just then, Joey yells from the tree he's in. Jack 
               automatically hides the picture as if the kid were from a 
               rival intelligence agency.

               Now when Jack speaks it is more guarded and in even quieter 
               tones.

                         The only difference is the eyes.

               Ramirez looks at the picture in shock at the resemblance.

                         and we have nothing to show for it. 
                         There is exactly one person in the 
                         world who can help us get Carlos.

                         much as six months to a year of 
                         preparation. It will involve a high 
                         degree of risk. That much said, you 
                         may never as much as lay eyes on him

                         won't be a threat to anyone anymore.

               Just then the cellular phone which Jack holds rings. Jack 
               smiles and holds out the phone to Ramirez.

               Ramirez takes the phone, totally faked out. He presses the

               weakly above him. His parents sit next to his bed. The father

                         are over a hundred individual shrapnel 
                         fragments. It was obviously designed 
                         by Carlos to maim, not to kill.

               out a small photo album, the kind families use to put in the 
               3×5 photos of their vacations. He puts it into Ramirez's

                         just trying to make you see the

               pennants, photos, ships in bottles, family photographs. He

               Just then there is a knock at the door. Ramirez closes the

               Montreal is an island in the middle of the St. Lawrence. It

               car as it drives up out of the city, up the mountain to of 
               all places, a cemetery which sits at the foot of a deserted 
               prison that looms above it. The cemetery like the prison is 
               deserted. There can be no more desolate place than a graveyard 
               full of long-dead prisoners whose prison has long since been 
               shut down.

               camera inconspicuously placed in a tree.

               A camera mounted atop a light fixture pans with Jack's car 
               all the way up to the prison entrance. Signs on the prison 
               proclaim that it is closed and that trespassing is forbidden. 
               As Jack pulls up at the prison, a plainclothed operative 
               comes out and as Ramirez and Jack pull Ramirez's bag out of 
               the car, the operative slips into the driver's side and whisks 
               it away. The ground around the area is full of snow that has 
               not been plowed so the look of desertion is complete.

               There is an observation tower in the middle of the room which 
               has become home to the pigeons who now flap noisily out of

               and single computer terminal and operator established earlier 
               as Technician #1. From here, cables snake their way along 
               everywhere. The place has the look of a mobile high-tech spy 
               station that just happens to be set up in a former prison. 
               Ramirez looks around. The idea of being in a prison is 
               obviously uncomfortable for him.

               could as easily be in a space station on the dark side of 
               the moon. There in the middle of a huge room looms a plastic 
               enshrouded satellite tracking system. The plastic hangs down 
               from the roof encapsulating this area to protect all of the 
               state of the art computer equipment from the dust. Inside 
               this plastic shrouded space we SEE technicians at monitors 
               which display every approach to the prison as well as monitors 
               which display the surveillance images transmitted back via

                         plotting to destroy Carlos, if he 
                         knew what we're trying to do, I assure

               Jack pushes through the plastic shroud into a command center-

               computers and neon lighting.

</b>                         Carlos has two main safe houses. One 
                         in Libya, one in East Germany. We 
                         have satellites that pass over each 
                         one three times a day. Unfortunately, 
                         the Russians know exactly when our 
                         satellites are in position so we 
                         have to assume that Carlos knows as 
                         well.

               They cross over to the satellite tracking monitors which 
               display both the Libyan and East German safe houses. Sitting 
               in front of one of the monitors is Amos, typing controls

                         advantage. He has the best protection 
                         in the world... three layers at least 
                         at all times. Next and maybe most 
                         important... Carlos himself. The 
                         French DST came to arrest him once. 
                         He was at his apartment, drunk, 
                         playing his guitar. He actually had 
                         them convinced it was all a mistake. 
                         Then he went into his bathroom, took 
                         a shave mind you so he would look 
                         his best for the interrogation and 
                         when he came out managed to shoot 
                         each of them through the forehead. 
                         Then he got the informer who had 
                         betrayed him, put him down on his 
                         knees and killed him... Think of it. 
                         He took a shave and didn't even nick 
                         himself once.

               Amos is quiet, lets that sink in.

               It is a huge, empty room. Ramirez sits at the lone table as 
               Amos enters. Ramirez is eating a bowl of porridge. His breath

               a warm jacket, he wears light prison overalls.

               Ramirez is doing furious situps, hanging off the balcony of 
               one of the tiers, with his feet linked under one of the bars 
               so that as he does his sit-up it is over an abyss. Amos stands 
               in front of Ramirez, puffing on a cigar as he speaks, so 
               that Ramirez is gulping in breaths of cigar smoke as he

               As Jack and Ramirez walk toward the cemetery, we SEE Ramirez 
               who wears a lightweight white parka so that he shivers in 
               the cold in contrast to Jack's heavy winter gear. Ramirez 
               carries what appears to be a gun.

</b>                         You need to not only remember the 
                         names on every tombstone, but where 
                         they are so when I call out a name, 
                         you whirl and shoot.

               They walk into a scene that is completely surreal. Standing 
               behind every tombstone is one of the crew of trainers.

               Each man wears a white parka and white pants against the 
               freezing cold. In the center of their impromptu circle stands 
               Ramirez, also wearing white, but of much lighter material so 
               that he shivers in the cold. All of them including Ramirez 
               hold paint pellet guns. It is a cemetery full of living 
               targets which can shoot back. Jack stands outside the circle.

                         from someone?

                         get you killed.

               Ramirez hesitates a moment, trying to remember where the 
               tombstone with the name "Brisson" is. The trainer who stands 
               behind the "Brisson" tombstone has no such hesitation. He 
               fires at Ramirez and an ugly black splotch of paint explodes 
               on Ramirez's white suit. Ramirez shakes his head in 
               frustration.

               Ramirez whirls, misses one, is hit again with another black 
               splotch but hits the Paquet tombstone square in the chest 
               with a black splotch of his own.

               There are flats supported by sand bags which form the "set" 
               of a kitchen. The set is perfect in every way but its position 
               inside of a huge prison hall lends a quality of the macabre, 
               since no movie is being shot here and no audience will ever 
               see these performances. Jack is there with Ramirez. He opens 
               the refrigerator and Ramirez looks inside as Jack times him 
               on his watch, then closes the refrigerator. Ramirez sneezes. 
               He has caught a cold but must ignore it.

                         fighter who loves champagne and 
                         caviar... LaPierre!

               Ramirez whirls and hits the trainer in his shoulder at the 
               same time that he himself is hit. Jack's look betrays no 
               emotion.

               As he says this last, Ramirez whirls and shoots another 
               trainer, dead in the chest. Ramirez smiles. He is beginning 
               to enjoy playing terrorist.

               Ramirez and Jack walk together on the belvedere which is an 
               observation area with a railing around it, overlooking the 
               abandoned prison. In between the belvedere and the prison is 
               a field which is almost completely barren except for one 
               tree. It sits down below.

               In the distance, we SEE a snow mobile approach with its lights 
               on. Just then, Jack takes a pocket sized remote transmitter 
               and slips it into the front pocket of Ramirez's jacket, 
               turning it on as he does.

</b>                         It's a transmitter.

</b>                         For what?

<b>                                     JACK
</b>                         Target practice. You're the target.

               Jack quickly moves away from Ramirez. As Ramirez moves, he 
               notices that the snow mobile changes direction as well, and 
               continues to home in on him. And then there is a second snow 
               mobile. And then a third, all of them coming straight for 
               him. He starts to run. The snow mobiles turn and continue 
               bearing down on him, driving him closer toward the railing. 
               We SEE the snow mobiles are controlled by radio antennas, 
               evidently homing in on his transmitter.

               Jack, who has moved quite a ways off, pulls out a Beretta 
               and sets it on the rail. We SEE on the snow mobiles, a lit-
               up remote device.

</b>                         If you shoot out the receivers, 
                         they'll stop. There are ten rounds 
                         in this clip. The first two are live, 
                         the next three dummy, then three 
                         live, two dummy.

               Ramirez stands like a deer in the headlights for an instant 
               and then goes running for the gun. He cannot make it to the 
               gun before the first snow mobile barrels down upon him. He 
               is right against the rail now and goes diving into the snow. 
               The snow mobile goes directly over him and crashes through 
               the rail, falling down to the field below. Ramirez is up and 
               running, grabs the gun, fires two rounds and misses, then 
               hits three dummy rounds which click away as the second snow 
               mobile draws closer. Then he fires and hits a headlight, 
               then fires and misses, then fires and hits the remote device. 
               That snow mobile stops in its tracks. The third now barrels 
               down on Ramirez. He clicks off two dummy rounds and just 
               before the snow mobile hits him, a shot rings out. The 
               receiver shatters and we SEE Jack standing with the smoking 
               gun with which he has just saved Ramirez's life.

               It is after lunch and Jack and Amos are eating ice cream 
               sundaes while Ramirez sits eating the last bit of porridge 
               from the huge bowl.

               He motions for the waiter who crosses with a fresh pot and 
               starts to ladle it out into Ramirez's bowl. Ramirez reaches 
               up and tears at his tie and rips open the top button. Ramirez 
               explodes batting the waiter's hand away and sending the bowl 
               flying.

               Ramirez walks casually through the living room with camera 
               following. Amos and Jack walk behind him. Ramirez bends down 
               to tie his shoe near the sofa. He crosses into the kitchen 
               and camera follows. He opens the refrigerator and takes out 
               a carton of milk. He takes a drink from the carton and 
               dribbles some onto his shirt and onto the floor. He gets an 
               "I'm such a slob" look on his face. Then he replaces the 
               milk, crosses to the sink, takes the sponge off the sink and 
               a paper towel. He mops up the spill with the sponge first 
               and then with the paper towel, then tosses the paper towel 
               into the trash. As he speaks, Ramirez himself will be amazed 
               at how much he is able to deduce using the techniques he's 
               been taught.

               with Jack, Amos, and Technician #1 who sit in front of a new

               Ramirez sits as before. He is eating his caviar as he looks 
               at his Arabic textbook.

<b>               ANGLE ON - THE TEXTBOOK
</b>
               It shows a picture of a street in an Arab country, possibly 
               Libya. It is a typical street scene; a dispassionately sterile 
               photograph in which one can almost hear the BBC announcer 
               voice in your head saying, "And here is a typical scene in 
               lovely Tripoli..." There is a man in a business suit walking 
               on the sidewalk in this picture. We CUT back and forth between 
               Ramirez and then as Ramirez strains to look harder, 
               unbelievingly, we PUSH IN tighter on the picture from his 
               POV and to our amazement, the man in the picture looking 
               back up at us is Ramirez! Then suddenly the man in the picture 
               moves and his finger comes up to his lips and he looks at us 
               and says, "SHHHHH." Just then, a street vendor in the same 
               scene pulls out a gun and shoots Ramirez in the picture in 
               the head. Ramirez falls and the picture goes back to a still 
               shot of Ramirez lying face down in the black and white photo, 
               oozing black blood onto the white sidewalk of beautiful 
               downtown Tripoli.

               He looks out the window at the bluish sky as we shift focus 
               between him and his background. He looks down at the bowl of 
               porridge.

               to the observation room.

               Ramirez walks down the corridor past the surveillance room. 
               The satellite dish is still there but there are no technicians 
               to be seen. He follows the cable that snakes down the corridor 
               towards the command room.

<b>               INT. COMMAND ROOM - MORNING

               Ramirez walks along the cable until he comes to the plastic-
               enshrouded satellite tracking system. He pulls one of the 
               plastic panels to discover that the place is totally empty. 
               He bends down and picks up the cable as if it were a lifeline 
               on a strip at stormy sea. He follows it hand over hand to 
               where all the equipment was -- it's gone. He looks around 
               and through the plastic, starts to see the silhouettes of 
               people moving and talking. Abruptly, he pulls the panel aside -- 
               just some pigeons against the moonlight shafts.

               At the sound of his shout, hundreds of pigeons explode out

               instinctively crouches in terror.

               straightaway. The road is open and straight ahead. Ramirez 
               drives on with total focus. The intensity is obvious. Up 
               ahead is a hairpin turn.

                         let down even after you negotiate 
                         the turn. You never know what's going

               We have a shot of the road, POV Ramirez through the 
               windshield. Suddenly as we negotiate the hairpin turn, there 
               up ahead of us sits Jacks in the middle of the road TIED TO 
               A CHAIR, looking straight at us.

               sitting straight, tied into the chair so that he could not 
               run if he wanted to. He doesn't move, just stares forward, 
               as if trying to lock eyes with Ramirez.

               The Jeep turns slightly to the right, then sharply to the 
               left. And as its back wheels lock, it slides and completes 
               the 180-degree turn. Just short of Jack.

               Ramirez jumps out of the Jeep, coming straight at Jack.

               Just then we HEAR the roar of the snowmobiles coming out of 
               nowhere, bearing down towards them.

                         one live.

               Ramirez looks at him, pushed to the breaking point now. He 
               pulls the transmitter out of his pocket and crosses right to 
               Jack and stuffs it in Jack's pocket.

               Ramirez waits for Jack to say something... to protest... to 
               say anything. Jack says nothing. Ramirez turns in a fury and 
               starts walking away as the snowmobiles bear down from four 
               different directions, coming straight towards Jack. Jack 
               says absolutely nothing. Ramirez turns and sees Jack is making 
               absolutely no attempt to toss the transmitter. Jack simply 
               locks eyes with Ramirez. Jack is not going to budge. Ramirez 
               turns his back and is about to continue walking away but the 
               noise of the snowmobiles bearing on the unrelenting Jack 
               grows louder. Ramirez can take it no more. He turns, pulls 
               out the gun and must run right to where Jack is in order to 
               get shots off at each snowmobile. He fires through the dummy 
               rounds until he takes out all four snowmobiles, the last of 
               which comes to rest only a few feet away from them both. 
               Ramirez is exhausted. When Jack speaks it is quietly and 
               with contempt.

               Ramirez turns, looking at Jack, unable to believe his ears.

               As we watch Ramirez listening to Jack, we can see him going 
               over the edge.

               Ramirez walks straight over to Jack, pulls his hair back so 
               that Jack is staring up at him and then he puts the barrel 
               of his gun at Jack's temple. Ramirez is not bluffing now. He 
               has gone completely into the dark side for the first time.

               Ramirez turns to see him, as Amos walks down the embankment 
               towards him.

               Ramirez stays with the gun pointed at Jack. It is obvious he 
               is in a killing mood, perfectly ready and willing to squeeze 
               the trigger once again. Amos takes the gun from Ramirez, 
               points it up and pulls the trigger... KABOOM!

               corner. We become aware of the room. It is a study in 
               contrasts. Light shoots in through shell holes and cracks in 
               ruined walls. And yet, the interior is somehow soft, sensuous, 
               with thick carpet, muslin drapes and a large bed that 
               resembles at one and the same time, a boxing ring and an 
               altar. She pays no attention to Ramirez. She doesn't even 
               acknowledge that he's entered the room. She is in a kind of 
               reverie.

                         doesn't lose himself with a woman... 
                         not with a lover... maybe with a 
                         whore I don't know... I wasn't his 
                         whore. Lovers are different to him... 
                         he might have a use for them... so 
                         he has to seduce them properly. He 
                         has to make sure they're so crazy 
                         about him they'll do anything for 
                         him.

               She holds up a hand without looking at him, commanding his 
               silence.

<b>                                     CARLA
</b>                         Shhh! You're not here.

               She rocks herself back and forth, comforting herself and now 
               for the first time we see the bottle of Irish whiskey she 
               holds at her side. She raises it, takes a long gulp, some of 
               the fluid dripping down the corner or her mouth. She doesn't 
               bother to wipe it away. It is there next to tearstains on 
               her cheeks.

               Slowly, her rocking back and forth, her primal comforting, 
               the act of an abused and abandoned child will turn into 
               strokes, caresses of a secret style from a phantom lover who 
               will get her in the mood for what she must do. She must get 
               herself wet. She must get herself ready. She must recapture 
               what it is to be seduced by Carlos. Her hand is her lover 
               now.

                         exactly what I say.

               She leans her head back and conjures Carlos up in her mind.

                         conquest... you know this seduction...

                         brainwashes you with his body... 
                         so... so... you'll do anything... 
                         you see because he's the perfect

                         please you... but to excite you... 
                         to... to make it dangerous for you 
                         and then, that's very sexy too, to a 
                         woman... that danger... like he could 
                         kill you in a second... but instead 
                         he makes you come... So he's almost 
                         killed you, you see? And you have 
                         this orgasm right then and it's like 
                         he's killed you and there isn't 
                         anything left of you and he makes 
                         you be born again the way he wants 
                         you to be. So there isn't a thought 
                         in your brain that he hasn't put 
                         there. Not a feeling in your body 
                         that he hasn't put there.

               She masturbates herself stopping just short of climax. Then 
               she looks up at Ramirez, acknowledges his presence and lets 
               him exist.

                         can deal with it. Understand?

               In the far distance, we are vaguely aware of a huge truck 
               barreling along, coming straight down the highway towards 
               them.

</b>                         We had an agent... the best we ever 
                         had in training. We were going to 
                         infiltrate him into Beirut and then 
                         use him to penetrate the PFLP. No 
                         student ever scored higher than this 
                         man... We set up his cover for six 
                         months in Argentina. He was perfect. 
                         And then we sent him to Beirut. He 
                         got off the plane, went to his hotel, 
                         went up to his room and had a nervous 
                         breakdown.

               Suddenly it seems, the truck is right on top of them, heading 
               straight for them, like monster in a child's nightmare. It 
               passes within inches and Ramirez has to fight to keep from 
               jumping as the truck roars past them. It is not a monster, 
               just a truck. Then again, it could have killed them just the 
               same.

                         could drug him and get him out on a 
                         plane. Okay? Now you understand? 
                         Nothing prepares you. I want you to 
                         know that so when it hits you, you 
                         don't panic, you feel the fear and 
                         then get rid of it.

               A cold, dreary, oppressive airport. Grim-looking SOLDIERS 
               and even more menacing SECURITY MEN in dark glasses. In the 
               line of arriving PASSENGERS, at the passport control booth,

               behind sunglasses, his heart is POUNDING, POUNDING, POUNDING.

               The foreboding paranoia that everyone is staring at him. 
               Soldiers, security men, airport employees, other passengers. 
               They all seem to know his secret. They're all just waiting 
               for the axe to fall. Ramirez heads over to the Customs booth. 
               He turns back as a guard pushes him aside to let pass a rich 
               Arabic family. A young fat girl holding some toys grimaces 
               at him as she indelicately makes her way with her family 
               through the crowd. In the b.g. we notice a Mercedes waiting 
               for them through the glass doors of the airport. Ramirez 
               continues on his way towards the Customs booth. Behind a

               Pockmarked face with exaggerated features. Ugly and mean. 
               Ramirez hands him his Colombian passport. The POUNDING 
               quickens.

               He barks in Arabic, motioning Ramirez to remove his 
               sunglasses. Ramirez does, fighting to remain calm under the 
               man's granite gaze. The official looks at the passport and 
               back at Ramirez. The following dialogue is in Arabic with 
               English subtitles.

               Now and for every other scene in which Ramirez passes himself 
               off as Carlos, he has brown eyes.

               Ramirez nods, smiling apologetically, searching for the words

               POUNDING, however, intensifies.

               We have a shot of the cab, an old Mercedes coming towards 
               us, and then under the arch leading to the entrance of the 
               hotel. Ramirez steps out and he's assailed by a bunch of 
               kids begging and trying to grab his baggage. He looks around.

               Across the street at a cafe soldiers with guns laugh. From a 
               shop window, the silhouette of a man seems to look right at 
               us. Across the street, kids on a balcony throw a water balloon 
               at a horse pulling a cart and the horse bolts right in front 
               of Ramirez.

<b>               BACK TO SCENE
</b>
               As the street urchins continue to beg and grab at his luggage, 
               and the taxi driver demands impatiently to be paid, suddenly 
               out of nowhere, a bellboy appears and smacks one of the kids 
               who falls to the ground. They all disperse as the bellboy 
               takes the luggage and leads Ramirez who pays the cab driver 
               and then crosses to the hotel.

               The bellboy enters with Ramirez, sets down his bags and then 
               opens the shutters of the window. Ramirez tips him silently. 
               Once the bellboy has left, Ramirez walks to the phone and 
               checks it out. Then he crosses to the shutters. Perhaps he 
               sees a shadow looking in his direction from the dark apartment 
               across the street. He closes the shutters. Just then, there's 
               a LOUD KNOCK on the door. He jumps and automatically goes 
               for his gun. But he has no gun... and his heart begins to 
               POUND again. The LOUD KNOCK repeats itself.

</b>                         Yes, sir.

               The voice is young, and not too assertive. Ramirez consults 
               his watch and looks out the window again. Everything still 
               seems to be normal.

               Ramirez carefully opens the door. In walks a young, rather 
               innocent-looking WAITER with a jar of ice water. He wears a 
               fez on his head. As he places it on a table, Ramirez eyes 
               him with suspicion. Suddenly the waiter reaches underneath 
               his jacket and... pulls out a small handgun.

<b>               ON RAMIREZ
</b>
               He is frozen with fear.

</b>
               Putting his finger to his mouth to signal silence, he shoves 
               the gun and silencer under a napkin. Then he takes off his 
               fez and from within, pulls out a small grenade and extra 
               clip of ammunition. Without any further attempt at 
               communication, he exits the room.

               Ramirez walks back into the bathroom. He splashes water on 
               his face and takes three deep breaths and then slowly looks 
               up into the mirror... and finds Carlos.

<b>               EXT. STREET IN LIBYA - DOWNTOWN TRIPOLI - DAY

               We SEE a beautiful dark haired woman of about thirty coming 
               down the street. There are several other pedestrians as well. 
               The woman is Agnieska. She carries a large bag of groceries.

<b>               EXT. STREET - TRIPOLI, LIBYA - RESIDENTIAL AREA - DAY

               A van is parked on the street. Agnieska walks along. The van 
               starts. A man whom we will come to know as VLADIMIR adjusts 
               the mirror. His partner NIKOLAI readjusts it and in it we 
               SEE Agnieska, walking. The two KGB operatives, now both see 
               Agnieska.

               Behind Agnieska about fifty feet behind her we SEE several 
               pedestrians, one is an Arab and another a European. Agnieska 
               goes up into an apartment building.

               Around the corner comes another Arab businessman type. The 
               first Arab stops in front of the apartment house and bends 
               down to tie his shoe. The second Arab comes up alongside of 
               him and the first Arab gives an almost imperceptible nod. 
               The second Arab goes into the apartment house.

               The van makes a U-turn and pulls around the corner to give 
               them another vantage point of Agnieska's apartment.

               Agnieska enters the apartment. She opens the door and slowly 
               walks in. The apartment is dark. She is about to turn on the 
               lights when suddenly a hand grabs her from behind around her 
               mouth and another hand holding a gun snaps right down next 
               to her head. She drops the groceries and screams but the 
               hand muffles it. She struggles a bit but the person who holds 
               her hisses.

               Outside the door we hear faintly the sound of footsteps. We 
               still cannot make out who is holding her. He appears to be 
               an Arab in traditional garb completely bald with mustache 
               and glasses. He speaks in a thick Arabic accent.

               The person holding her still has his gun at her head. He 
               cocks the trigger back with a loud noise. The gun has a 
               silencer on it.

               stands over her.

               The bald Arab who was holding her slowly takes his belt out 
               of its loops and puts his gun back in his pants. He holds 
               the belt as if he is going to strangle her.

               agents arrive at the top and see Ramirez. Ramirez takes a 
               deep breath and jumps, barely making it, clinging onto a 
               pipe on the side of the building. Once again, we Intercut

               Ramirez hears something. Turning around, Ramirez shoots an 
               agent at the top of the building. The body falls and gets 
               tangled into the string of electrical wires. He reaches into

               bomb and then popping the hood and examining the engine and 
               then examining the ignition wires. Satisfied, he takes a

               nods inside the apartment building and another DST man comes 
               out with Agnieska next to him. He opens the door for her

                         Excuse me sir... I asked if you knew 
                         where I could buy a newspaper.

               Ramirez stops for a moment. He knows that the line is some 
               kind of code and he has no response to give so he starts up 
               walking again. Koj is instantly behind Ramirez, his hand 
               going into his flight bag and pushing the flight bag up 
               against Ramirez's back.

                         room, very carefully.

               Amos. He watches it all going down in the back of a chrome 
               napkin holder. He slowly gets up, looks around for Jack and 
               goes out into the corridor and sees Koj and Ramirez going 
               into the rest room. Koj sees one of those sandwich board 
               signs off to the side which says, "LAVATORY TEMPORARILY CLOSED 
               FOR CLEANING." He pulls it in front of the door.

               Koj has Ramirez's head with one hand, while he holds the gun 
               on him with the other. He forces Ramirez's head down deep 
               into the toilet bowl. He flushes. The water level sinks and 
               then rises, covering Ramirez's face. Koj holds him under 
               water long enough to almost drown him. Then, instead of 
               lifting his head out, he flushes again and the water level 
               lowers.

                         or you're dead.

               Just then Ramirez manages to kick back and overpower Koj and 
               send him flying back out through the door of the stall. 
               Ramirez is back on him in a second but Koj has his gun up 
               and pointed right at Ramirez's head. They have shifted 
               position now, so that they are not facing the stall, but the 
               door of the bathroom. Koj is about to pull the trigger when 
               we HEAR:

               Ramirez ducks and rolls out of the way and Amos fires two 
               shots into Koj's chest but not before Koj can get off a round 
               right into Amos' chest. In an instant Ramirez is on the still-
               alive Koj grabbing his head in his hands and slamming it 
               down onto the edge of the sink with a thud that cracks his 
               skull. He quickly crosses to Amos who is dying.

               Here, Amos speaks as a doomed father would to a son who still 
               has a chance to save himself from the Holocaust.

                         all be for nothing... Get out now...

               Ramirez stands as Amos literally pushes him away. Ramirez is 
               the brave and dutiful son as his father says, coaching, 
               teaching him to the last...

               Ramirez is ashen faced, knows Amos is right and forces himself 
               to stand up and walk almost robot-like out of the restroom.

               On a long shot we SEE Ramirez walk down the corridor till he

               A taxi pulls up in front of Ramirez's house. Ramirez steps 
               out of the taxi dressed in his Navy uniform and carrying his 
               sea bag. He does not have a hat on and we SEE his head while 
               not bald, is now in the shortest of buzz cuts, certainly 
               much shorter than the way his wife last saw him. He stands 
               outside the house looking at it like an adult who has come 
               back to his boyhood home and finds it suddenly so small. 
               Just then the door opens. There is Maura holding the baby 
               and next to her, Joey. Ramirez runs toward them and they to 
               him and we SEE them in tableaux, embracing. An idyllic family 
               reunited.

               Ramirez sweeps books off of a table, lifts her out of the 
               chair and lays her out on the table. The two of them climax 
               together. It is clear from Maura's look that this is the 
               best sex she's ever had. Ramirez slowly rolls off her. He is 
               smiling as well, and then becomes aware that Maura has begun

               It is Little League Day. Adorable kids are dressed up in 
               their uniforms ready to play the next level of baseball. 
               They have graduated from T-ball to coach-pitch, in which the 
               coach pitches the ball for the kids. There are hot dogs and 
               lounge chairs, family dogs and... fathers. The mothers are 
               there as well, as are brothers and sisters, but primarily it 
               is the fathers trying to fulfill their own dreams of sports 
               glory through their kids.

               Ramirez has his arm around Joey, giving him his last bit of 
               fatherly advice.

</b>                         Right! So you go out there and have 
                         fun.

               He gives Joey "five" and Joey runs out to join his team at 
               their dugout. Ramirez starts walking about toward Maura and 
               the baby. As he does, he crosses next to another father, 
               FRANK, who is with his son TYLER. Frank is about six foot 
               four and to say that he is competitive would be the 
               understatement of the year. He is haranguing his kid as if 
               this were the deciding game of the World Series. He is on 
               one knee so we don't see just how big he is.

                         dickin' around today, you understand?

               Tyler looks at his shoes. He is cowed and embarrassed.

<b>                                     TYLER

</b>                         You're gonna be focused and aggressive 
                         and you're gonna play to win. Got 
                         it?

               Tyler is still staring at his toes.

                         hear myself talk? Look at me when 
                         I'm talking to you!

               Frank suddenly smacks him in the face. Annibal stops in front 
               of the two of them.

                         say? It's just a game?

               Frank looks at Ramirez and stands to his full six foot four.

                         beer, you piece of shit. And you

                         and I'll beat the living fuck out of 
                         you. What do you say to that?

<b>               ANGLE ON - RAMIREZ
</b>
               There isn't a trace of Ramirez here at all. It is pure Carlos.

<b>                                     FRANK

                         A dead man...

               But before Ramirez can move, we HEAR:

<b>                                     MAURA (O.S.)
</b>                         Annibal... please!

               Ramirez turns. Maura is there beside him.

<b>                                     MAURA
</b>                         Annibal please. Let's go sit down.

<b>                                     FRANK
</b>                         Good idea, Annabelle. Your ol' lady 
                         just saved your ass.

</b>                         Annibal... please... Please...

               Maura tugs at Ramirez's arm and Frank smirks. Ramirez cages 
               the monster inside and turns with Maura. As he turns, Frank 
               turns to Tyler as if he cannot believe the boy is still there.

<b>                                     FRANK
</b>                         What are you doin' standing here?! 
                         You're supposed to be over there 
                         with your team! Now move!

               The boy hesitates. Frank rears back his arm to hit him.

<b>                                     FRANK
</b>                         I said...

               But before Frank can complete the sentence and strike his 
               child, Ramirez comes flying through the air with a kick 
               planted straight to Frank's head. It is sudden and violent 
               and brutal. He comes down and with one side-kick, "knee-caps" 
               Frank, which is to say he hits the top of Frank's kneecap 
               and breaks it so that it is down around his shin. Frank starts 
               to drop but before he can, Ramirez grabs his ears and brings 
               his head down into his own swiftly rising knee. The result 
               is devastating and Frank's nose is now all across his face. 
               Blood is everywhere and Ramirez does it again. Now the object 
               is Frank's teeth, so that when his head comes off of Ramirez's 
               knee, his mouth is a mass of blood as well.

               In slow motion, Ramirez turns and sees his son who stares in 
               horror at what his father has just done. At the same time, 
               maura is up and grabbing onto Ramirez. Ramirez however is 
               not done. Frank is completely defenseless now and Ramirez 
               leans him back across his knee, pulls him by the hair exposing 
               his throat like that of a sacrificial lamb about to be 
               slaughtered. This time instead of a knife, it will be a karate 
               chop from Ramirez which will crush Frank's windpipe and kill 
               him. But before he can deliver the blow, Maura grabs his 
               arm. He turns to her, almost about to hit her or throw her 
               off and the two of them are face to face as Ramirez looks 
               from her to his son and realizes how deep into the abyss he 
               has plunged.

               slaps her and sends her back into the wall. She holds her 
               cheek. He is an inch away from her face and now he is about 
               to show her Carlos, to become him in front of her.

               A man's figure emerges stealthily from the shadows of the 
               mansion's back wall.

               The blonde, bearded Ramirez.

               CLICK, CLICK, CLICK... The quick sound of the camera shutters.

               Faintly we HEAR the sound of a motorbike start up. Then we 
               SEE Ramirez on the motorbike heading off. Ivan and Andrei 
               follow him at a distance.

<b>               EXT. ROAD LEADING INTO EAST BERLIN - MAGIC HOUR
</b>
               The KGB car falls in behind another car separating it from 
               the motorbike and follows Ramirez into town. He passes by 
               giant steam pipes in the foreground as the KGB car follows.

<b>               EXT. ROAD - EAST BERLIN - MAGIC HOUR
</b>
               A tram wipes the screen to reveal Ramirez, on his motorbike, 
               followed by the KGB car. The landscape is desolate, with 
               drab row-houses. Ramirez gets to a red light. As it turns 
               green he sees the KGB car in his mirror. He jams across the 
               street, just barely fitting in between two criss-crossing 
               streetcars. Ivan and Andre lose sight of Ramirez.

<b>               EXT. STREET - EAST BERLIN - DUSK
</b>
               Ivan and Andre shoot forward and then slow, as they spot 
               Ramirez buying a newspaper at a newstand.

<b>               ANGLE ON - RAMIREZ
</b>
               He holds his motorcycle helmet in his hand, and using it as 
               a mirror, he sees the KGB car in its reflection. Satisfied 
               that they have caught up with him again, he walks across the 
               street to the beer hall.

<b>               INT. BEER HALL - DUSK
</b>
               The large bierstube is crowded, noisy and enveloped in a 
               thick cloud of cigarette smoke. Its lively, at times rowdy 
               clientele is in various stages of intoxication. As the loud, 
               oom-pah-pah-pah band plays popular German music, those who 
               are not too busy eating, talking, or emptying liter-sized 
               beer steins, sing along.

<b>               ON RAMIREZ
</b>
               Fighting the crowd, he heads for the back of the beer hall, 
               looking for his contact.

<b>               ON IVAN AND ANDREI
</b>
               Entering the place, they pretend to be camera-carrying Russian 
               tourists. A common sight in East Berlin.

<b>               ON RAMIREZ
</b>
               He stops and stares.

</b>
               Through the jam pack, the profile of a man, with a Tyrol hat 
               who sits along the back wall. Busy eating, he seems totally 
               oblivious to the hoopla around him. We can't really see his 
               face.

<b>               ON RAMIREZ
</b>
               As he cautiously approaches what he thinks is Jack. It isn't 
               him. There is a sudden look of panic on his face and then he 
               spots Jack also in the same kind of hat. Lifting his head, 
               and turning to face Ramirez, we too recognize him. Under the 
               hat, and the new heavy eyebrows and mustache, is... Jack. He 
               smiles, takes off his hat, and motions his quest to sit down.

<b>               ON ANDREI (THROUGH IVAN'S CAMERA)
</b>
               He's posing with a giant stein. A slight shift of focus and 
               we can see Ramirez. Jack, however, is hidden by the waiter's 
               back. Then, the Waiter moves on.

               only when the view of the two is blocked again by other 
               people.

               Ramirez emerges from the beer hall. He heads back to his 
               motorbike.

</b>
               Seconds later, the two KGB come out. This time, only Andrei 
               takes after Ramirez. Ivan gets into a taxi which heads in an 
               opposite direction.

               Reaching the mansion, Ramirez discreetly steals his way toward 
               its back wall. Then, just as slyly as he earlier had 
               materialized, he disappears.

               Watching Ramirez vanish into the mansion wall.

</b>
               He lies in the thick bushes, completely obscured from anyone's 
               view and now he removes the blond wig and the rest of his 
               disguise. Underneath his "disguise" clothes, he is wearing a 
               pair of black jeans and black T-shirt. He looks exactly like 
               Carlos now.

               Jack takes off his disguise as he drives the Volga to the

               reads: 9:15 as he slows the car to a crawl.

               A head shot of Ramirez in his latest blond, bearded disguise. 
               Grainy and blurred at first, it's gradually being brought 
               into sharp focus.

               PULL BACK to reveal a GROUP OF MEN closely watching the screen 
               of an impressive, state-of-the-art computer. We recognize 
               only one of them. Andrei. At the computer's sophisticated 
               keyboard -- manipulating the images on the screen -- are TWO 
               TECHNICIANS in white overalls. Right behind them stands the 
               Head KGB Officer from Moscow and his Aide.

               It bisects, to allow a picture of the real Jackal (the 
               splitting image of Ramirez) to appear on the right half of 
               the screen.

<b>               BACK TO SCENE

               The Head KGB Officer puts on his glasses and takes a closer 
               look at the monitor.

               One of the two technicians toys with the keyboard.

               The beard and moustache on Ramirez' disguised image slowly 
               disappear. The two faces look very similar.

<b>               CLOSE - SCREEN

               A huge nose covers the entire left half of the screen.

<b>               ZOOM

               The upper part of the nose only. And... the incriminating 
               hairline where the bogus schnoz had been superimposed on the 
               real one.

                         wig...]

               As the aquiline nose assumes the shape of the Jackal's -- 
               the hair changes both color and form to match his -- the two 
               faces on the screen become identical.

               The Head KGB Officer turns to his Aide.

               It opens slowly. One by one, a half dozen MFS -- including 
               the two we've seen earlier -- sneak out. Just as furtively, 
               armed KGB -- led by the Head KGB Officer and his Aide move 
               in through the still-open door.

               He watches the KGB men enter the compound.

               Meeting no resistance on the ground floor -- whose security 
               apparently has been the task of the MFS -- the intruders 
               climb the open, spiral staircase. They move cautiously, 
               silencer-equipped weapons in hand.

<b>               ANGLE
</b>
               Reaching the upper floor, they hear the muffled sound of 
               RHYTHMIC MUSIC coming from the far end of the hallway to 
               their right. The Head KGB Officer motions his Aide to move 
               into the corridor to their left. He does, taking three KGB 
               with him. Four others -- including Andrei and Ivan -- follow 
               the Head KGB Officer into the hallway to their right.

<b>               INT. HALLWAY
</b>
               It's long, with several rooms on each side. As Vladimir moves 
               gingerly into the first one, Ivan covers him from the door.

<b>               INT. ROOM
</b>
               Illuminated only by the light which filters through the open 
               door, the room is quite dark. A faint sound of SNORING reaches 
               Andrei from the bed closest to the door. Quickly there, his 
               arm goes up. Then, for a split second, the flash of metal as 
               the knife comes down hard. The victim's last MURMUR. Followed 
               by the SOUND OF MOVEMENT at the other bed.

               In the beam of Ivan's flashlight, a waking JAPANESE is 
               reaching for his gun. Pffft. Pfffft. And he too falls back 
               to sleep. Eternally.

               TWO more JAPANESE in the midst of a Go game meet the same 
               fate. A burst from Head KGB Officer's automatic finishes 
               them off.

               Doing away with several more of Carlos' multinational gang, 
               the five KGB finally reach the room with the large, heavy 
               French doors at the end of hallway.

<b>               INT. OUTSIDE CARLOS' BEDROOM

               Quietly approaching the carved-wood doors, a KGB tries the 
               knobs. The doors are locked. Suddenly, the pulsating LATIN 
               BEAT which emanated continuously from behind the doors, stops.

<b>               ON HEAD KGB OFFICER

               He's startled by the sudden silence.

               Not wasting any time, Andrei and Ivan kick the doors open. 
               Diving to the side, they cover the other two KGB who storm 
               in with their Kalashnikovs very much at the ready.

               The voluptuous blonde -- her body glazed with post-coitus 
               sweat -- is paralyzed with fear; covering her prized assets 
               seems the last thing on her mind. She gapes at the KGB 
               marauders with wide, blue eyes. Not so, Ramirez's look-alike. 
               Caught reaching from under the sheets to replace the tape in 
               the stereo by the bed, he instinctively tries for his gun.

                         all night.

               She's putting stockings on a pair of legs that could distract 
               even the most committed KGB.

               With Kalashnikovs still trained on Carlos, they seem unable 
               to resist stealing glances at the blonde.

                         I'll prove it to you. You'll be 
                         pleading for my forgiveness. Let's

                         I demand to be interrogated.

               He seems truly eager to leave with them now, as if confident 
               he can prove his case. Dressed, with the exception of a 
               jacket, he casually grabs one which lies on a nearby chair.

               Too late. The Scorpion machine-pistol is already out, spouting 
               deadly accurate fire. He kills the Head KGB Officer first, 
               then...

               Hysterical, she screams her healthy lungs out.

<b>               INT. HALLWAY - MANSION
</b>
               Suddenly there's the sound of APPROACHING STEPS. The KGB are 
               down the corridor, rushing to the bedroom, led by the Aide.

<b>               ON CARLOS
</b>
               He doesn't hesitate. Firing a few rounds at them, he sprints 
               toward the window and literally flies through its shattering 
               glass.

<b>               EXT. MANSION - TREES - NIGHT
</b>
               Ramirez lies in some bushes about fifty yards from the house, 
               dressed in the black jeans and T-shirt. He hears the gunfire 
               from the mansion.

<b>               EXT. MANSION COURTYARD
</b>
               It's a dark night, and only a few dim lights illuminate the 
               rather large back yard.

<b>               ON CARLOS
</b>
               Landing in a bed of flowers, he rolls, and is quickly on his 
               feet with the machine-pistol in hand.

<b>               ON TWO ARMED KGB
</b>
               Securing the courtyard, they rush to the spot where, 
               apparently, they'd seen him land. Carlos, however, is no 
               longer there.

<b>               ANGLE
</b>
               Glued to the back of a tree, the Jackal cuts them down with 
               one short burst and goes for the KGBs who appear at the broken 
               window. As they take cover, he quickly confiscates a 
               Kalashnikov from the dead KGB closest to him and makes it to 
               the high wall which encircles the place.

               Carlos climbs over the wall with the Kalashnikov and drops 
               outside the compound to the grass below.

<b>               ANGLE ON RAMIREZ IN THE GRASS
</b>
               He sees to his horror that Carlos is getting away. He is 
               ready to scream, going crazy. He has no gun, he wouldn't 
               stand a chance against Carlos, but there is no way he is 
               going to let him get away, no way. He looks around for a 
               rock... anything.

               There is nothing. Carlos turns his back. Ramirez sees his 
               chance, he gets up on one knee ready to make his move when 
               suddenly he sees two more KGB guys come running around the 
               wall of the compound.

<b>               ANGLE ON RAMIREZ
</b>
               He mouths the words:

<b>                                     RAMIREZ
</b>                         Kill him... Kill him...

<b>               ANGLE ON CARLOS
</b>
               He whirls and fires at the two KGBs who fall.

<b>               ANGLE ON RAMIREZ
</b>
               He can't believe it. Carlos is getting away?

<b>               ANGLE ON CARLOS
</b>
               He suddenly gets a look as if he feels someone's presence. 
               His eyes open wide and he starts to turn when Ramirez comes 
               flying out of the darkness and leaps on Carlos. The two are 
               dressed exactly alike. Carlos is hit from behind and is 
               stunned and drops the assault rifle.

               Ramirez has Carlos down and is choking him. Carlos looks up 
               at him more shocked than anything else. Finally Carlos manages 
               to break the grasp and kicks Ramirez off. Now it is a dazzling 
               display of martial arts. Then Ramirez charges Carlos and 
               tackles him and the two go rolling off into the bushes and 
               darkness. When they roll out of the bushes we have no idea 
               which one is which or who we should be rooting for. Just 
               then Jack's Volga drives up at the side.

<b>               ANGLE ON THE TWO CARLOSES
</b>
               They roll over onto the bodies of two dead KGB. There is a 
               Kalashnikov on the ground pointed into the Carlos on the 
               bottom's side. The Carlos who is on top manages to get his 
               finger over to the trigger and pulls it sending a burst into 
               the Carlos on the bottom's body. Just then the Carlos on top 
               looks up and sees Jack standing over him with a gun pointed 
               at him ready to shoot. In b.g. we HEAR cars with sirens 
               approaching. The Carlos on top looks over to Jack who is 
               ready to shoot him.

<b>                                     CARLOS ON TOP
</b>                         Don't shoot. It's me you asshole!

               Jack just stares at him and then lowers his gun.

<b>                                     JACK
</b>                         Let's get the fuck out of here.

               He turns around and starts to get into the Volga. The Carlos 
               on top, whom we just thought was Ramirez bends down and 
               reaches for the dead KGB's pistol.

<b>               ANGLE ON JACK
</b>
               He gets that sixth sense feeling and turns around, his gun 
               raised and pointed at the man whose hand is now on the pistol. 
               Is it Carlos or Ramirez, who is standing there with pistol 
               in hand almost turned to Jack but still at a disadvantage in 
               this Mexican stand off.

<b>                                     JACK
</b>                         Have you come looking for me now, 
                         Annibal?

<b>                                     THE MAN WITH THE PISTOL
</b>                         What the fuck are you talking about...

<b>                                     JACK
</b>                         Awfully warm for this time of year 
                         isn't it?

               The man with the pistol knows this is a password of some 
               kind and the look on his face betrays the fact that he doesn't 
               have an answer. Jack is just about to shoot him when a burst 
               of machine gun fire is heard from the approaching cars and 
               it rips into the tree next to Jack who dives for cover.

               That act of self-preservation gives the man we now realize 
               is the real Carlos the chance he needs. With catlike grace 
               he dives, rolls and vanishes into the shadows. He has gotten 
               away and Jack has to decide whether to go after his quarry 
               or rescue his friend. He opts for the latter, scoops up 
               Annibal and throws him into the Volga and speeds off as cars 
               approach from the other side.

               Ramirez is in bed, hooked up to all the monitors and tubes 
               and IVs but he is going to make it. Jack is there with him, 
               having just entered.

               Jack nods his head. Ramirez almost breaks down in tears. 
               Jack crosses to him to comfort him.

</b>                         Then it was all for nothing... the 
                         whole thing.

<b>                                     JACK
</b>                         No it wasn't. He's finished. The KGB 
                         bought it. As far as they're 
                         concerned, he's the enemy now. He'll 
                         bounce around from one country to 
                         the next. But his paymasters have 
                         disowned him. None of their client 
                         states will risk using him. No one'll 
                         trust him again. He'll spend the 
                         rest of his life looking over his 
                         shoulder waiting to be betrayed. And 
                         it'll happen... sooner or later... 
                         when it's to some country's 
                         advantage... they'll give him up or 
                         they'll trade him. He's finished. It 
                         worked and he's finished.

               We hear the phone hang up. We hear the sound of a door opening 
               and closing that leads into the garage from the house. We 
               hear the sound of a car door opening. And then the key turning 
               in an ignition. And then the door is blown off the garage as 
               we see the Ramirez family car burst into an inferno and blaze 
               away inside the garage in a fiery blast which would kill one 
               and all instantly.

               The cemetery is set up for a funeral. There are various Navy 
               officers and their families in the chairs. At the back of it 
               all stands Jack wearing sunglasses, his face a mask into 
               which it is impossible to read any emotion of any kind. There 
               are four graves and four coffins, two adult-sized and two 
               small ones. Admiral Crawford addresses the mourners.

                         a tragedy like this. A highly 
                         respected Naval officer returns from 
                         six months of hazardous duty. He has 
                         escaped the danger we all come to 
                         know in the service of our country. 
                         He is about to go to church with his 
                         beloved family and in an instant... 
                         they are no more. They are with God. 
                         Our minds cannot comprehend such 
                         tragedy... only an undying faith in 
                         the Almighty a faith that says even 
                         though we cannot see it, there is a 
                         plan. That and the knowledge that as 
                         in life, so for eternity are they 
                         together...

               It is a beautiful island community with clusters of villas 
               overlooking a magnificent coastline. A postal truck winds 
               its way towards one of the houses.

               The POSTMAN gets out of his truck and crosses to the door of 
               the house. He knocks on the door. The door opens... it is 
               Ramirez... or Carlos... we don't know which. He wears shorts 
               and a shirt.

               The Postman hands the man an envelope. He signs for it and 
               opens the envelope. It is a newspaper clipping...

               The headline is: NAVAL OFFICER AND FAMILY KILLED IN FIERY

               Mendoza crosses into the house holding the newspaper clipping. 
               He takes a cigarette lighter and burns it and across his

               An old man who walks with a cane and whose face is horribly 
               disfigured by burns hobbles in to the medical building. He 
               passes a plaque on the wall that says in English and Arabic:

               The old man locks the door and stands in front of the mirror. 
               He pulls off the burn makeup and scalp wig and we see that 
               he is Carlos. Several years older, but unmistakable. He takes 
               off the old man's clothes and stuffs them in a trash can and 
               underneath he wears the black jeans and T-shirt. Then he

               Carlos walks down the corridor and enters the medical suite 
               of Doctor Wasfi Muhammed. There is a plaque on the door which 
               says, DR. WASFI MUHAMMED, M.D., PhD, Cosmetic and Plastic

               This is a surgery suite complete with gas anesthetic, a kind

               The scene is as before. The two bodyguards stand watch. 
               Suddenly a car pulls up. Another bodyguard gets out and out 
               of this car steps Carlos. The bodyguards acknowledge him as 
               he enters the building.

               Carlos leans back in the surgery chair. There is an IV

               He pulls down his surgical mask and Carlos looks up at his 
               own face. It is Ramirez. He holds Carlos, who struggles 
               against the anaesthetic. Suddenly, a second pair of hands 
               grab Carlos as well. It is Jack.
