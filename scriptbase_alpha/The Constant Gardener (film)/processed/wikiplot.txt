Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), a shy low-rung British diplomat and horticultural hobbyist posted in Kenya, is one to avoid making a fuss until he learns that his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) was found dead on the veld.
Tessa has been murdered at a crossroads along with her Kenyan driver.
Her colleague doctor Arnold Bluhm (Hubert Koundé) is initially suspected of her murder but is later found to have been murdered on the same day as Tessa.
Various rumours abound that the two were having an affair; however, it is later revealed that Bluhm was in fact gay.

In flashbacks, we see how in London, Justin met his future wife Tessa, an outspoken humanitarian and Amnesty activist, falls in love with her and how she persuades him to take her back with him to Kenya.

As the mystery surrounding his wife's death unfolds, Justin is radicalised in his determination to get to the bottom of her murder.
He soon runs up against a drug corporation that is using Kenya's population for fraudulent testing of a tuberculosis drug ("dypraxa") with known harmful side effects and disregards the well-being of its poor African test subjects.

Danny Huston plays Sandy Woodrow, the British High Commissioner on the scene.
Bill Nighy is Sir Bernard Pellegrin, head of the Africa Desk at the Foreign Office and thus Justin's and Sandy's boss.
After finding out the truth about what happened to Tessa, Justin is killed at the place where she died.

Justin's gentle but diligent attention to his plants is a recurring background theme, from which image the film's title is derived.
