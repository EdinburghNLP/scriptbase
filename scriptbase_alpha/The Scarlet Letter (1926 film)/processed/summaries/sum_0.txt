In Puritan Boston, seamstress Hester Prynne is punished for playing on the Sabbath day; but kindly minister Arthur Dimmesdale takes pity on her.
The two fall in love, but their relationship cannot be: Hester is already married to Roger Prynne, a physician who has been missing seven years.
Dimmesdale has to go away to England; when he returns, he finds Hester pregnant with their child, and the focus of the town's censure.
In a humiliating public ceremony, she is forced to don the scarlet letter A - for adultery - and wear it the rest of her life.
Dimmesdale is encouraged by the church fathers to demand of Hester the person with whom she sinned.
