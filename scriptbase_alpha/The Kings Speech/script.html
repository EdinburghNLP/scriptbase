<b>                           THE KING'S SPEECH
</b>

                               Written by

                             David Seidler



<b>      OPEN ON:
</b>

<b>1   INT. BATHROOM, YORK HOUSE, LONDON - DAY (MID-1930'S)              1
</b>
    A shimmering surface of cold water - held in an immense, free
    standing, white enamelled bathtub with gilded lion's legs -
    bulges in SLOW MOTION to the chords of Handel's "Trumpet
    Volunteer".

    A head emerges.

    White gloved hands, in livery, rush to envelope the surfacing
    naked wet body in white towels.


<b>2   INT.    DRESSING CHAMBER, YORK HOUSE - DAY                        2
</b>
    The ritual continues with crisp military precision.

    CLOSE ON the Royal Coat Of Arms stamped in gold: lion and
    unicorn embrace a shield divided into four quarters with harp,
    thistle, and more lions denoting England, Ireland, Scotland and
    Wales. The shield is surmounted by a crown.

    This emblem is on a cuff-link fastened on a starched white
    shirt.

    Trousers, pressed to a knife-edge, are held for stockinged feet
    and gartered legs to be inserted.

    Mirror-polished boots are laced tight.

    Jacket, held ready. Arms, shoulders, chest received.

    Glistening medals attached to front of jacket create a dazzling
    field of ribbons and medallions.

    Epaulets, edged with gold braid tassels, are adjusted.

    Polished buttons are fastened.

    Multi-coloured collar clasped shut.

    White ostrich feathers, topping a tri-corner hat, are fluffed
    and placed upon brilliantined hair.

    PAN DOWN to the handsome features of Albert, Duke of York, known
    to his family as BERTIE. He's in his late thirties, the second
    son of King George V, the reigning King of England. He conveys a
    sensitivity which appears in conflict with the manner in which
    he's been bedecked.

    Reflected in a full length mirror, Bertie tells himself:
           TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    3.


<b>                             BERTIE
</b>                   You look like a Christmas tree.

    He smiles wanly.


<b>3   EXT.    INNER COURTYARD, YORK HOUSE, 145 PICADILLY - DAY            3
</b>
    THE ROYAL STANDARD flaps atop a gleaming chrome grill.

    Liveried footmen open the doors of a stately Austin Princess.

    Bertie exits York House with his young wife - ELIZABETH -
    considered by all to be one of the loveliest women in the land,
    truly an English rose. Golden Labradors and Corgis appear from
    all directions, weaving between them, barking boisterously,
    creating a happy chaos.

    Elizabeth and Bertie glance upwards and wave.

    Two little girls, LILIBET and MARGARET ROSE, aged eight and
    four, wave back from their nursery window.


<b>4   INT/EXT.    AUSTIN PRINCESS, HYDE PARK CORNER - DAY                 4
</b>
    Bertie nervously lights a cigarette.    Elizabeth pats his hand.

<b>                             ELIZABETH
</b>                   Buck up, Bertie. The BBC said it wouldn't
                   rain.

    BERTIE'S POV - Speaker's Corner with its assortment of orators,
    prophets, protestors, and onlookers gathered around soapboxs,
    agreeing, disagreeing, shouting comments. Others carry
    placards, sing protest songs. A miners' strike is the focus of
    the day.

    A large, rather untidy workingman with a florid rosacea nose
    spots the passing Austin and stares at the occupants.

    REVERSE ANGLE - Bertie's face stares back.

    The first drops splatter against the glass.      Elizabeth sighs.

<b>                             ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>                   Never trust the wireless.

    Bertie's face is obliterated by the increasingly heavy downpour,
    which segues into a GARGLING sound.
           TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     4.


<b>5   INT.    BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY                                5
</b>
    A gentleman in a tuxedo, carnation in boutonniere, is gargling
    while a TECHNICIAN holds a porcelain bowl and a towel at the
    ready. The man in the tuxedo is a BBC NEWS READER. He
    expectorates discreetly into the bowl, wipes his mouth
    fastidiously, and signals to ANOTHER TECHNICIAN who produces an
    atomizer. The Reader opens his mouth, squeezes the rubber bulb,
    and sprays his inner throat. Now, he's ready. He looks to the
    control room.

    The FLOOR MANAGER begins a count-down: five... four... three...
    two...

<b>                             BBC NEWS READER
</b>                   Ladies and Gentlemen: good afternoon. This
                   is the BBC National and World Programmes
                   taking you to Wembley Stadium.

    He speaks in flawless pear-shaped tones.    There's no higher
    creature in the vocal world.


<b>6   EXT.    WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY                                        6
</b>
    ELEVATED SHOT looking down on a sea of dripping black umbrellas
    hiding the spectators from view.

    Bertie and Elizabeth takes their places in a row of gilded
    chairs with the other dignitaries. They are:

    KING GEORGE V - a barrel-chested man with Naval beard and
    uniform, accompanied by his wife.

    QUEEN MARY - an elegant but icy grande dame.

    DR COSMO LANG - a tall, unctuous, churchman with a high, domed,
    balding head, and a perpetual expression of moral superiority.

    WINSTON CHURCHILL - a politician of sixty, as portly as Lang is
    lean. They are bantering rivals in ambition.

    STANLEY BALDWIN - the Prime Minister of the day. Heavy-browed.
    His hair, as always, parted down the middle.

    NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN - Chancellor of the Exchequer. Tall, thin,
    lugubrious, with the expression of a quizzical chicken hawk.

    A BBC technician places a huge imposing microphone suspended on
    springs next to the stadium equipment. It looks frightening,
    even to us. Bertie's shoulders brace as though expecting a
    blow. Elizabeth sees his terror.
           TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                  5.


<b>                             ELIZABETH
</b>                   Why wasn't he told?

<b>                             COSMO LANG
</b>                   Ten million people listening around the
                   world, Mam. Possibly more.
                       (as though Bertie didn't
                        exist)
                   His brother, and father, have been
                   broadcasting since last year.

    The King, growing impatient, hisses:

<b>                             KING GEORGE V
</b>                   Get on with it. Show what you're made of!

    Bertie moves forward diffidently, without an ounce of
    confidence, knowing deep within he's doomed. His stomach knots,
    chest muscles contract, constricting his breath.

<b>                             BERTIE
</b>                   Luh-luh-lords, la-la-ladies, gen-tell-men.

    It is a shock to realize this is a man with a profound stutter.
    A man who cannot speak in public.

    Lang whispers to Churchill.    When Lang whispers, everyone can
    hear.

<b>                             COSMO LANG
</b>                   I wouldn't miss His Highness' maiden voyage
                   for all the world. And on such an important
                   occasion.

    Lang really is a piece of work.

    For ease of reading, Bertie's stutter is not indicated from this
    point on in the script.

<b>                             BERTIE
</b>                   No doubt you wish the Prince Of Wales was
                   standing before you today.

    POV - a sea of dripping umbrellas. No response. This is going
    to be a torment for him, and his audience.


<b>7   INT.    BBC BROADCASTING STUDIO - DAY                             7
</b>
    A glowing dial on the face of a studio radio.    Everyone
    listening intently.
            TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                  6.


<b>                              BERTIE (ON RADIO)
</b>                        (stuttering profoundly)
                    Be that as it may...my brother David is
                    attending to other duties in the furthest
                    parts of this vast Empire...

     The radio falls silent.       Eyes widen in concern.


<b>8    EXT.    WEMBLEY STADIUM - DAY                                     8
</b>
     Bertie stands frozen, his mouth agape, jaw muscles locked. He
     knows he's considered by all, especially himself, unfit for
     public life.

     Elizabeth is devastated.

<b>                              KING GEORGE V
</b>                    Just needs more practice.


<b>9    EXT. HARLEY STREET - NEW DAY                                      9
</b>
     TRACKING SHOT - rain splatters on brass plaques denoting Dr This
     or Dr That, specialists in various maladies. Halt at a plaque
     that reads: LIONEL LOGUE, SPEECH SPECIALIST.


<b>10   INT. RECEPTION ROOM, LOGUE'S CHAMBERS, HARLEY STREET - DAY     10
</b>
     Umbrella stand, coat rack, wooden waiting bench: that's all.

     The door is flung open and Elizabeth enters, drenched, her hat
     decorated with white silk roses, now limp. A veil covers her
     features.

     She waits. Coughs.    No response.    Calls imperiously:

<b>                              ELIZABETH
</b>                    Are you there?

     From behind a door:

<b>                              LIONEL (O.S.)
</b>                    In the lav.

     Princess Elizabeth is not used to this sort of thing. She's
     further appalled by the loud gurgling of a toilet being flushed,
     and startled by the entrance of - LIONEL LOGUE. He's in his
     forties, tall, with piercing eyes and charismatic features. His
     demeanor is friendly, but professional. The accent, although
     Australian, is not heavy, he is after all a speech therapist.
    TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                        7.


<b>                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>            "How poor are they that have not patience!
            What wound did ever heal but by degrees?"

<b>                          ELIZABETH
</b>            Pardon?

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Iago...world's greatest villain. Just wants
            to be bad. Sorry, no receptionist.

He offers to shake hands.    She doesn't take it, even though
she's gloved.

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>                (with sang froid)

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            That's not a promising start.

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            My husband's seen everyone. They were all
            useless. He's given up hope.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            A bit premature.

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            Because he hasn't seen you?

Lionel doesn't disgree.

<b>                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>            You're very sure of yourself.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured.

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            Of course my husband wants to be cured! His
            position requires public speaking upon
            occasion. A torment. I fear the requirement
            may grow more frequent.

</b>            Indentured servitude?

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            Something of that nature.

<b>                       LIONEL
</b>            Well, have your `hubby' pop by and give his
            personal history. I'll make a frank
            appraisal.

<b>                        ELIZABETH
</b>            Doctor...

Logue tries to object but she over-rides.

<b>                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>            ...I do not have a "hubby". We never talk
            about our private lives. Nor do we `pop'.
            You must come to us.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Sorry, this is my game, played on my turf,
            by my rules.

The lady lifts her veil.

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            Perhaps you'll make an exception?

He recognizes her instantly, and is clearly impressed, yet
refuses to be intimidated.

<b>                       LIONEL
</b>            I thought the appointment was for
            "Johnson"?

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            A name used during the Great War, when the

            Royal Highness was aboard.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I'm considered the enemy?

<b>                      ELIZABETH

            obliging.

<b>                              LIONEL

                    equality. That process takes place in my
                    consultation room. No exceptions.

<b>                              ELIZABETH
</b>                    In which case...
                        (re-lowering her veil)
                    I should have kept my pledge. I promised my
                    husband I'd stop seeking "The Great Cure."
                    I've wasted your time. And mine.

     She exits, closing the door firmly behind her.

     A foot kicks a ball. Lionel is returning home from work. He's a

     of them passes the ball to Lionel who, despite briefcase and
     rolled brolly, dribbles skillfully before passing the ball and
     entering a modest brownstone.

</b>            Can I be a penguin instead?

He drops to his knees and waddles. In his tux he looks like a
penguin. The girls giggle, but are undeterred.

</b>            The horsie story, please.

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>            Ah well.

Called upon to perform, the stutter returns slightly. But the
two girls listen raptly, ignoring their father's minor
impediment, and it fades.

<b>                      BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>            Once upon a time there were two horsies. A
            white horse that went clip clop clip clop
            through Hyde Park. And a black horse that
            went clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park.
            They met in the middle of Hyde Park. The
            white horse said "neigh". The black horse
            said, "neigh". The white horse continued
            on, clip clop clip clop through Hyde Park.
            The black horse continued on, clip clop
            clip clop through Hyde Park. And that's the
            end of the story. Now off to bed.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            What did David say?

<b>                      KING GEORGE V
</b>            She made him sublimely happy. I said: that
            was probably because she was sleeping with
            him. "I give you my word we've never had
            immoral relations." "As my son, as Prince
            of Wales, as my heir, do you solemnly swear
            your friendship with this woman is an
            absolutely clean one?" "I do", he said.
            "Look me in the eye," I said. "On my
            honour" he said. Stared straight at his
            father... and lied.

             this family, and this nation, within twelve
             months. Who'll pick up the pieces? David's

             British Union of Fascists are marching

A red light attached to the mike begins a series of warning
blinks.

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>             What're you going to say?

<b>                       KING GEORGE V
</b>             The usual guff. The Archbishop writes it.
             My people love to hear me say it. Spoken
             fluently, of course.

They're interrupted by the entrance of the BBC News Reader and
Technicians.

<b>                       KING GEORGE V (CONT'D)
</b>             That's the chap who taught me how to use
             this contraption. You touch your chin with
             your thumb and the `thing' with the end of
             your little finger. Splendid fellow.

SQUISH.   Assisted by the Technicians, the News Reader sprays his
throat.

<b>                       BBC NEWS READER
</b>             Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is
             the BBC, broadcasting direct from
             Buckingham Palace upon the occasion of the
             Royal Silver Jubilee. His Majesty: King
             George the Fifth.

<b>                       KING GEORGE V
</b>                 (to the mike)
             "I can only say to you, my very very dear
             people, that the Queen and I thank you from
             the depths of our hearts for all the
             loyalty and - may I say so? - the love with
             which this day and always you have
             surrounded us. I dedicate myself anew to
             your service for all the years that may
             still be given to me."

The News Reader, terribly moved, whispers to his Technicians:

                       modesty)
                  I showed HM how to do it.

</b>
     The edge of the crowd is visible. One can sense a vast sea of
     humanity. When the glass doors of the upper balcony open the
     murmur becomes a ROAR. When the King steps out, it becomes
     tumultuous.


<b>19   EXT.   BALCONY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CONTINUOUS                  19
</b>
     The King is joined by Queen Mary and the Archbishop of
     Canterbury, other Royals, and dignitaries. The noise is
     deafening. The King beckons impatiently for someone still
     inside to join them. It's Bertie, with Elizabeth.

<b>                            BERTIE
</b>                  They didn't come to see us, Father.

<b>                             KING GEORGE V
</b>                  Pretend.

<b>                            BERTIE
</b>                  Where's David?

<b>                             KING GEORGE V
</b>                  Bedding his American whore. Come, join the
                  fun!
                       (aside to Elizabeth)
                  You'll have to do a lot more of this. I'm
                  sending him to the Midlands. With all the
                  factory noise they won't hear a word he
                  says.

     The King goes back to waving.   Elizabeth is stunned at the
     prospect.

     The ROAR of the crowd segues into the ROAR of machinery.


<b>20   INT.   MIDLAND FACTORY - NEW DAY                                20
</b>
     Huge industrial wheels whir in neutral. WORKERS are lined up
     dutifully to hear the visiting Royal. Bertie's lips move, but
     with the noise he cannot be heard. Elizabeth watches in relief.

     Then a FOREMAN, trying to be helpful, signals.     The machinery
     halts, the factory falls silent.
        TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     18.


     At first the momentum of speaking without being heard carries
     Bertie forward.

<b>                            BERTIE
</b>                  What's needed is cooperation...

     Hearing his own voice reverberate through the cavernous factory
     brings Bertie's stutter back in full form.

<b>                            BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>                  ...buh-buh-between the cuh-cuh-classses...

     One of the workers sullenly pulls a chain, releasing a blast
     from a steam whistle that drowns Bertie out.

<b>                            BERTIE
</b>                  Is this necessary?

<b>                            ELIZABETH
</b>                  You know perfectly well.

     As they pass a corner news stand, the headline chalkboard reads:
<b>     PRINCE OF WALES TELLS MINERS "SOMETHING MUST BE DONE!"
</b>
<b>                            ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>                  Neglects to tell them what must be done,
                  how its to be done, and who's to do it.

<b>                            BERTIE
</b>                  David has `the touch'. They adore him.

     As the Austin halts for lights, people stare to see who's
     inside. Some point.

<b>                            BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>                  I'll wager they're saying: There's the
                  useless one who can't speak.


<b>23   INT. LOGUE'S WAITING ROOM - DAY                                23

     Bertie and Elizabeth enter. She explains in a whisper:
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   19.


<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            There's no receptionist.

Elizabeth glances nervously at the lavatory door.

<b>                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>                (loudly)
            The Johnsons.

From the inner office.

<b>                      LIONEL (O.S.)
</b>            Not finished yet.

Elizabeth is relieved its not coming from the lav.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            How'd you find this physician?

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>                (poker-faced)
            Classifieds; next to "Saucy model,
            Shepherd's Market".

Bertie smiles despite his mood.

<b>                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>            Comes highly recommended. Charges
            substantial fees in order to help the poor.
                (realizes)
            Oh dear, perhaps he's a Bolshevik?!

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I'm not sure I want to see this fellow.

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            I'm not sure he wants to see you.

The consultation room door opens and a working class young woman
- ANNA - comes out; then realizes with a gasp who they are. She
retreats rapidly back into the consulting room.

<b>                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>            Perhaps this was a mistake.

After an uncomfortable moment, Anna returns, attempting to be
properly formal, and stutters:

<b>                      ANNA
</b>            You can go in now, "Mr. Johnson".

<b>                      BERTIE

<b>                           ANNA
</b>                     (whispers, terrified)
                 I know.
                     (then to Elizabeth)
                 Dr Logue says...

<b>                            LIONEL (O.S.)

<b>                           ANNA
</b>                 Lionel says...wait here if you wish. Or, it
                 being a pleasant day, take a stroll.
                     (to the consultation room)
                 Was that alright?

<b>                           LIONEL (O.S.)

<b>                           ANNA
</b>                     (choking up)
                 Thank you...Lionel.

     Anna flees quickly.

<b>                           LIONEL (O.S.)
</b>                 Mr. Johnson, do come in.

     The Yorks look at each other.

     A totally different universe from the Spartan waiting area. A
     world of books - piles of them spilling everywhere. Two
     slightly shabby, but comfortable armchairs. Well-worn Turkish
     rug. Hotplate and two chipped mugs. Model airplanes hanging
     from the ceiling. Recording apparatus. The walls are pearl grey
     and smoky blue.

<b>                           LIONEL
</b>                 Glad we have something in common.

     Bertie's head bangs into one of the models.

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>             You're too close. Five paces is the rule of
             thumb.

<b>                       LIONEL
</b>             That might be difficult in this office.

Bertie perches uneasily on the edge of an armchair.

<b>                       LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>             Nice girl, Anna. Worried she wouldn't find
             a husband if she couldn't speak. Tried to
             convince her men will find her even more
             attractive as a silent partner. The perfect
             woman. Sorry, bad Australian joke. Why'd
             your wife change her mind and ask for an
             appointment?

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>             I can't discuss that.

<b>                       LIONEL
</b>             What can we talk about?

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>             That's better. When speaking with a Royal
             one waits for the Royal to start the
             conversation and chose the topic.

<b>                       LIONEL
</b>             Your joking. That won't work here.

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>             I admit if one waits for me to start a
             conversation one can wait a rather long
             time.

Silence.   They stare at each other.

<b>                       BERTIE (CONT'D)

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            That's what I'll call you then. We must be
            true equals.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            If we were equal I wouldn't be here, I'd be
            at home with my family and no-one would

Bertie starts to light a cigarette from a silver case.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Don't do that.

Bertie gives him an astonished look.

<b>                      BERTIE

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Don't be ridiculous.

<b>                      LIONEL

            talk to yourself?

<b>                      BERTIE

Silence. The jug has boiled.    Lionel makes himself a cup of tea.

<b>                      BERTIE (CONT'D)

<b>                      BERTIE

</b>            Royals don't carry money.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            How convenient.

Logue fishes a coin from his pocket and puts it on the table.

<b>                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>            I'll stake you. Pay me back next time.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Correct, I haven't agreed to take you on.

During this, Logue has uncovered a piece of apparatus, a
recording device with earphones. He sets a blank disc onto the
turntable and positions a microphone, then hands Bertie an open
book. Bertie glares at it defiantly.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I certainly can't read The Bard.

<b>                      LIONEL

Bertie reads, stuttering badly and getting worse.

Reaches for the coin.

</b>            Not so fast.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I proved I can't read.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            You proved you can't listen.

Hands Bertie a pair of heavily padded earphones.    Bertie doesn't
want to take them.

<b>                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>            A princely bob is at stake.

Bertie reluctantly puts on the earphones. Logue turns a dial.
LOUD MUSIC is heard. Bertie takes off the earphones. The music
stops.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            You're playing music.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>            I'm aware.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            How can I hear what I'm saying?!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Bertie, you're Royal. Surely a prince's
            brain knows what its mouth is doing?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            You're not well acquainted with Royal
            princes, are you?

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I want to demonstrate that when you can't
            hear your voice, you don't stutter, thus
            proving your impediment is not innate.

<b>                         BERTIE
</b>            Rubbish.

Bertie replaces the earphones. Again, the LOUD MUSIC. His lips
move as he reads, but all that can be heard is the music.
Finished reading the passage he takes off the earphones and the
music ceases. He reaches for the coin, but Logue snatches it.

<b>                           BERTIE
</b>                 I've no idea what an Australian might do
                 for that sort of money.

     Logue puts the record in a brown paper dust jacket and hands it
     to Bertie.

     A grass strip cut into the moors. Bertie waits beside a shooting
     break, the stiff breeze whipping his coat, as a small plane
     lands and taxis. The cockpit canopy slides back and the pilot
     leaps out, removing his leather helmet and goggles, revealing
     hair gleaming like gold, perfect teeth flashing a dentist's
     smile. This is - DAVID - the Prince of Wales, Prince Charming,
     the media's darling, a sun god descended from the skies
     accustomed to being worshipped by all.

     The King is propped up in bed, wrapped in his favorite faded
     Tibetan dressing gown, hooked to an oxygen tank. He's
     surrounded by his wife, Queen Mary, his two eldest sons, his
     Secretary - CLIVE WIGRAM - his personal physician - DR DAWSON,
     and a NURSE.

     Wigram presents a tray with papers and pen.

     Bertie, in despair and grief, has been describing to Elizabeth
     what happened.

</b>                 The look in mother's eyes, it
                 was...ghastly.

     He notices something on his desk, the record Logue made.

     POV: the label - His Master's Voice - stares up at him.

     He releases his emotions in an outburst of anger.

<b>                           BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>                 What's this bloody thing doing here?!

<b>                           BERTIE
</b>                 The man was a total fraud!

     He picks up the record and is about to smash it against the edge
     of his desk, then realizes the mess that would make and tosses
     it into a waste paper basket. Then changes his mind.

<b>                           BERTIE (CONT'D)

                 this   babble!

     Bertie takes the record from the trash and walks to a Victrola
     stand, lifts the arm, places the steel needle, expecting to hear
     his stuttering voice. Instead, what he hears is flawless and
     flowing:

<b>                           BERTIE'S RECORDED VOICE

     Bertie lifts the needle. He and his wife stare at each other;
     there are tears in her eyes.

     The ROAR OF A HUGE delirious crowd is heard, growing in volume.
     The roar becomes chillingly recognizable: "Zeig Heil! Zeig Heil!
     Zeig Heil!"

     Lionel lumbers out of the closet, a pillow stuffed into his
     jacket to create a monstrous hunchback. His acting, performed
     just for his children, is quite magical.

Lionel fires up the hot plate.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            You were about to sing an aria concerning
            your brother.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I'm not crooning to the tune of "Swanee

<b>                      LIONEL

            "The Arch of C, he said to me, doo-dah doo-

<b>                      BERTIE

</b>            My future King? He's your future King too.
            Did that cause friction? Knowing he'd grow
            up to be King, but you wouldn't.

<b>                      BERTIE

Lionel makes the pot.

<b>                      LIONEL

Bertie, a bit abashed, holds up three fingers.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            ...it was a relief. Knowing I wouldn't be
            King.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Why's that?

Lionel hands him a mug of tea.   Bertie realizes it's chipped and
possibly none too clean.

Reaches into his jacket for his cigarette case.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            No smoking. What's the age difference?

While Logue isn't looking, Bertie surreptitiously wipes the rim
of the mug with his handkerchief.

<b>                      BERTIE

<b>                      LIONEL

            Doo-dah doo-dah.
                (then)
            David and I were very close.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            As you said: eighteen months.

<b>                      BERTIE

</b>            Young bucks... You know.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I don't, or I wouldn't ask. Did you go
            after the same girls?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Upon occasion.

<b>                      LIONEL

            What an extraordinarily rude thing to say!
                (quickly under control)
            David did try to be her beau at one point.

            when they were young, kept a girl in St
            John's Wood and shared her on alternate
            nights.

An uncomfortable silence.   Too much has been said.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Now dope the other wing. Did David tease
            you?

<b>                      BERTIE

            it would make me stop. Is this necessary?!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Otherwise the paint will eat through the
            tissue.

<b>                      LIONEL

            memory?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            You asked that before.

<b>                      LIONEL

<b>                      LIONEL

<b>                      LIONEL

<b>                       BERTIE

to Logue.

                   Cuts both ways.

     As Bertie is about to leave, Lionel requests casually:

<b>                             LIONEL
</b>                   And if you decide to come, bring the
                   Duchess. She might be helpful.

<b>                              BERTIE
</b>                   She might. If I asked. Very nicely.
                       (at back door)
                   And how will Myrtle take to our coming into
                   your home?

<b>                             LIONEL
</b>                   Not sure. She isn't speaking to me.

                   Wants to go home.
                       (pause)
                   After the funeral then?

     Bertie doesn't answer. Exits. Logue is left holding the plane.
     He goes to the waiting room door.

     A drum roll is heard.      Thrum.   Another...   Thrum! Thrum!


<b>45   EXT.   ST. GEORGE'S CHAPEL, WINDSOR CASTLE - NEW DAY               45
</b>
     Funereal bagpipes wail, joining the measured drum-rolls.
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     50.


On the balcony of the Castle, decorated with black bunting, is a
huge BBC microphone, and arrayed in front of it a row of
uniformed dignitaries wearing Naval hats of the Napoleonic Wars,
replete with ostrich feathers.

One of the dignitaries reads a declaration:

<b>                      DIGNITARY
</b>            Whereas it has pleased Almighty God to call
            to His mercy our late Sovereign, King
            George the Fifth of blessed and glorious
            memory...

During this, INTERCUT to the REVERSE ANGLE, showing a massive
military parade, mainly Navy personnel, wending its way through
the main street of Windsor towards the Castle, accompanying a
gun carriage on which rides the King's coffin, draped with the
Royal standard, on which rests the Royal Crown topped by a
Maltese Cross.

David is seen - very serious.

<b>                      DIGNITARY (CONT'D)
</b>            ...that the High and Mighty Prince Edward
            Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick
            David is now become our only lawful King.

Canons are fired.

Startled by the salute, a large flock of blackbirds rise up and
streak across the wintery sky.

A MURMUR, then a shocked GASP, as the gun carriage transverses a
tram track and tilts precipitously. Suddenly the Royal Crown
tumbles and falls, knocking off the Maltese Cross.

<b>                      COSMO LANG (O.C.)

<b>                      WINSTON CHURCHILL (O.C.)

The Archbishop and Churchill are watching the events from the
shadows at one end of the balcony.

Below - a scramble to restore the Cross to the Crown, and
replace both atop the coffin.

<b>                      COSMO LANG

pale.

     Bertie waits at a table with a group of immaculately attired
     courtiers and dignitaries. This is the Coronation Committee.
     The chair at the head of the table is empty, everyone waiting
     for its occupant.

     He finally arrives. David. He gestures for Bertie to come into
     the corridor, but deliberately leaves the door open so the

     into the conference room.

<b>49   INT/EXT. AUSTIN PRINCESS ON SOUTH KENSINGTON STREET - NEW DAY49

     The lion rampant flutters on the bonnet of the Austin. Inside,
     Bertie, wearing a black armband, gestures for the driver to
     stop. Pulling his homburg over his brow, Bertie wraps his scarf
     around the lower portion of his face. Then catches his
     reflection in the rearview mirror. Tells his driver:

     Not wanting to draw attention to his destination, Bertie has
     disembarked several buildings away from Logue's address. He
     makes his way hurriedly.

     WACK. A soccer football hits him on the back.    He wheels
     around.

     The group of local lads look at him unabashed.

instilled in him are going off.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            The lurking shadows. Courtiers and
            peers...the whole panoply of a class which
            once ruled the nation which once ruled the
            world, afraid of losing their last vestige
            of privilege if the monarchy is further
            debased.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Your wife was the one who sought me out.

<b>                      BERTIE

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I'm beginning to ask myself that very same

            throne.

<b>                      LIONEL

     square jaw - MRS WALLIS SIMPSON. Her most attractive physical

            You're well aware, of course, George IV's
            wife, Mrs. Fitzherbert, was very common
            indeed...and previously married. She signed
            an agreement that she could never become
            Queen, and their children could not be
            Royal. A rather sensible morganatic
            arrangement.

         Your brother held conversations with the

         Scotland Yard intercept: "Who is King here?
         Baldwin or I? I myself wish to talk with
         Hitler, and will do so here or in Germany."

         Americans. The British may not want me as
         their King, but I'll soon be back as their

</b>                  At long last I am able to say a few words
                  of my own. Until now it has not been
                  constitutionally possible for me to speak.
                  A few hours ago I discharged my last duty
                  as King and Emperor.

</b>                  Now that I have been succeeded by my
                  brother, the Duke of York, my first words
                  must be to declare my allegiance to him.

                  This has been made less difficult to me by
                  the sure knowledge that my brother has one
                  matchless blessing, enjoyed by so many of
                  you, and not bestowed on me -- a happy home
                  with his wife and children.

<b>                            DAVID (V.O. RADIO FILTER)
</b>                  I have found it impossible to carry the
                  heavy burden of responsibility and to
                  discharge my duties as King as I would wish
                  to do without the help and support of the
                  woman I love.

     Lionel gets up to turn it off as David's voice concludes:

     the Accession Council. He holds his arm out, expecting them to
     run to him for a hug and kiss, his solace after the ordeal.
     They remain where they are.

Anna nods earnestly.

recognizing him, she bobs her head.

</b>            What has my brother given up on his

They look at each other, unsure.

<b>                      BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>            Wouldn't it be a good idea to find out
            before coming to me? He cannot be Mister,
            as he was born the son of a Duke. Which
            makes him a Lord at the very least.

<b>                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
</b>            Very well, Lord E.W. it is.

</b>            Unacceptable!

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            So you prefer he takes a seat in the House

<b>                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
</b>            Certainly not.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            But if he's made a Royal Duke, and called
            His Royal Highness, he cannot stand for
            Parliament. Nor may he speak or vote in the
            House of Lords.

     Myrtle is in the shop window, arranging handbags, luggage, and
     briefcases.

     In the store Myrtle can be seen dressing the window, while in
     his glass office the OWNER, a portly bald gentleman with a
     Dickensian air, is deep in concerned conversation with a man in
     trench-coat. The Owner keeps glancing worriedly in Myrtle's
     direction.

     The two men nod, shake hands. The fellow in the trench-coat
     leaves. The owner beckons another shop-girl over and whispers
     something to her. She heads towards Myrtle.

     A wall divides the study from the living area, allowing the
     action in both spaces to be viewed.

     IN THE PARLOUR: Elizabeth waits, ill at ease.

<b>     IN THE STUDY:
</b>
<b>                            LIONEL
</b>                  Splendid. Here's another. "She sifted seven

<b>                            BERTIE
</b>                  Those are my hardest sounds.

     Lionel gives him a look.

Logue goes to the door and starts to open it. He shuts it
quickly.

<b>                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>            I wasn't expecting Myrtle for several
            hours!

IN THE PARLOUR: Myrtle has entered, definitely unhappy. Seeing
Elizabeth, she's even less happy, and flabbergasted.

<b>                       MYRTLE
</b>            Milady?

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            "Your Majesty", the first time. After that,
            "Ma'am". Not Malm as in Palm, Mam as in
            ham. I'm informed your husband calls my
            husband Bertie and my husband calls your
            husband Lionel. I trust, however, you won't
            attempt to call me Liz.

IN THE STUDY: Lionel stands listening, ear to the door.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            How're they getting on?

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            As to be expected.

IN THE PARLOUR: Myrtle announces:

<b>                      MYRTLE
</b>            You may call me "Madam Logue".

Myrtle's at a loss knowing what to do with a Duchess.

<b>                      MYRTLE (CONT'D)
</b>            May I offer you a cup of tea, Ma'am?

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            Thank you, Madame Logue, but I'm waiting to

Silence.

<b>                      MYRTLE
</b>            You don't like my husband. That's what I
            was told.

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            I was told the same.

<b>IN THE PARLOUR:

<b>                      MYRTLE
</b>            I don't want my Lionel getting hurt.

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            There's only one thing can save him now:
            success.

IN THE STUDY: the men are growing increasingly nervous.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            We're being cowards.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Of course. We're sensible men.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            You should go in.

<b>                       LIONEL
</b>            Me? You.

<b>                       BERTIE
</b>            Why me?!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            You're the Royal.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Being a monarchist, I recognize these are
            your digs. Therefore: here you rule.
            Therefore: you go in.

Urged by Bertie, Logue opens the door.

IN THE PARLOUR: Logue enters, pretending total innocence and
surprise, followed by Bertie, also trying to keep the pretense.
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    85.


<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Oh! Hello, Lady Elizabeth! Oh! Hello,
            Myrtle darling! What a pleasant surprise.

Myrtle stares at him and takes her revenge.

<b>                      MYRTLE
</b>            Will the Yorks be staying for dinner?

Logue and Bertie look panic-stricken.   Elizabeth comes to the
rescue.

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            A previous engagement.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Some other time, love.

Logue ushers Elizabeth into the study, giving Myrtle a nervous
little wave. She glares and exits.

<b>IN THE STUDY:
</b>
<b>                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>            Glad you had a chance to meet Myrtle.

<b>                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>                (to Elizabeth)
            Good of you to come.

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            Harley Street is far too public. What is my
            function here?

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            For me to show you how to pitch in.

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            Oh dear, I may not be a `pitch in' type.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Piece of cake.
                (to Bertie)
            Please assume a supine position on the
            floor.

<b>                       ELIZABETH

Bertie dutifully lies on the floor.

<b>                         LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>               Breathe deeply...expand your chest... now

               Splendid. How do you feel?

<b>                         BERTIE
</b>               Full of hot air.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               Well on your way to becoming a qualified
               political speaker. Again...

Bertie inhales deeply.

<b>                         LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>               ... and hold. Now, Princess Elizabeth, be
               so kind as to sit on your husband's
               stomach.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>               Good grief.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               Gently of course.

Elizabeth sits gingerly on Bertie's stomach, asking
solicitously:

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>               Are you alright, Bertie?

Bertie nods.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               Now exhale slowly...down goes Princess
               Elizabeth...inhale slowly...nothing rushed,
               expanding your chest fully, extending the
               column of air til it hits the
               diaphragm...and...up comes Princess
               Elizabeth. Exhale...down goes Princess
               Elizabeth...inhale...up comes Princess
               Elizabeth. You get the idea. Doesn't have
               to be Princess Elizabeth of course, but I
               thought you'd prefer your wife to one of
               the staff. Now comes the fun part.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>               There's actually more?

Bertie springs to his feet while Logue opens a window.

<b>                             LIONEL

                   five of them, as loudly as possible, each
                   to last no less than 15 seconds. There's
                   poor coordination between your larynx and
                   diaphragm. Princess Elizabeth, you can be
                   the official timer.

<b>                             ELIZABETH
</b>                   Vowel sounds? Shouted at an open window? On

                   vibrating loudly in full view of the world
                   can learn to give a public speech.

<b>                             ELIZABETH
</b>                   They can also be considered quite dotty.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>               When that poor chap first walked into my

               eyes and all the outward symptoms of the
               person upon whom a habitual speech defect
               has set the sign. You saw him today; once

<b>                         MYRTLE

</b>               You say that, but you don't listen when I
               say, in so many ways, how desperately I
               want to go home, how I never, ever,
               intended to stay here. This was to be a
               holiday trip to see `Mother England', and
               you turned it into quite something else.
               What happened, Lionel? We went to Wembley
               Stadium, next thing...you'd cashed in our

<b>81   INT.   WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY                              81
</b>
     A massive cavern of stone statuary and stained glass. The
     center piece of this particular section is the throne of Edward
     the Confessor. Scaffolding is in the process of being erected
     to supply lighting for the Coronation. Archbishop Lang and
     Churchill inspect it with satisfaction.

</b>                  Only the vulgar ones.

     Churchill pours two nips of whiskey into metal cups nested in a
     hip flask.

</b>         Demonstrably untrue.

</b>         They say he has epilepsy.

<b>                   WINSTON CHURCHILL
</b>         Patently erroneous.

<b>                   COSMO LANG
</b>         Fragile, prone to illness...

<b>                   WINSTON CHURCHILL
</b>         Some correctness in that.

<b>                     COSMO LANG
</b>         ...and will die prematurely. They predict
         he'll be unable to complete the Coronation.

<b>                   WINSTON CHURCHILL
</b>         What do you propose? Shorten the ceremony?
         Or no ceremony at all?

<b>                   COSMO LANG
</b>         My idea exactly!

<b>                    WINSTON CHURCHILL
</b>         I believed so. But what we need is a
         pageant of pomp and pomposity to impress
         the world.

<b>                   COSMO LANG
</b>         What we need, and what we'll get, may be
         two rather different things. Did you hear

         public.

<b>                   WINSTON CHURCHILL

         of the Empire, rallying all to our defense?

<b>                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
</b>            Best ask our new King.

Bertie has entered with Logue. Lang spins around.

<b>                      COSMO LANG
</b>            Your Majesty.

<b>                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
</b>            Excuse me, sir, duty calls.

He exits quickly. Cosmo continues nervously as they walk
through the Abbey, the Archbishop pointing out the preparations
in progress, particularly a booth for broadcasters.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Is this the scene of the crime?

<b>                      COSMO LANG
</b>            What a peculiar thing to say.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Referring to my assault upon the ears of
            the listeners.

<b>                      COSMO LANG
</b>            Ah, yes, wireless is indeed a Pandora's
            Box. I have, however, categorically said no
            to the BBC's new "radio-with-pictures"
            gadget. Imagine, the unwashed viewing us as
            we blow our noses or scratch our bottoms.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Radio with pictures?!

<b>                      COSMO LANG
</b>            It is called..."television". Happily, with
            a transmission range of only fifteen miles
            this "TV" thing has no future. We shall,
            however, be forced to permit cinema; the
            product of which I shall personally edit.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            That'll keep you busy, removing all my
            stops and starts.

<b>                      COSMO LANG
</b>            Unless of course you'd prefer a quiet
            ceremony?
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   93.


<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            What exactly do you mean?

<b>                      COSMO LANG
</b>            Something...discreet...private. We could
            pre-record an edited version to be
            broadcast to the world. Or even find an
            actor with a similar voice.

Logue has arrived and comes out of the shadows.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            A King based upon deception?

Cosmo takes Bertie aside.

<b>                      COSMO LANG
</b>            If your gentleman from Security would give
            us space, we could discuss this in private.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            You mean my bodyguard,"Crusher?"

Giving Lionel a scathing look, Lang continues speaking to Bertie
confidentially.

<b>                      COSMO LANG
</b>            Fret not. As I assured our nation in my
            recent broadcast: "When his people listen
            to their new Monarch they will note an
            occasional momentary hesitation in his
            speech. But to those who hear it, it need
            cause no sort of embarrassment, for it
            causes none to him who speaks." You see,
            I've paved the way. But should you wish to
            avoid further stress...

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Why not paint him pink and cover him with
            sequins?

<b>                       COSMO LANG
</b>            Pardon?!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            If you wish to call attention to his
            anxiety.

<b>                      COSMO LANG
</b>            Does your bodyguard know to whom he's
            speaking? He certainly doesn't know his
            place!

<b>                   BERTIE
</b>         Doctor Lionel Logue, my speech therapist.

<b>                   COSMO LANG
</b>         Therapist?! I'd no idea! Had I known Your
         Majesty was seeking assistance I would've
         made my own recommendation.

<b>                   BERTIE
</b>         Dr. Logue is to be present at the
         Coronation.

<b>                   COSMO LANG
</b>         Impossibly to find room. Even for a Doctor.

<b>                   LIONEL
</b>         Just Lionel.

<b>                   BERTIE
</b>         Behind the chair of Edward the Confessor.

<b>                   COSMO LANG
</b>         The Royal Box!? Your Family will be seated
         there.

<b>                   BERTIE
</b>         Which makes it most suitable.

<b>                   COSMO LANG
</b>         Perhaps I might be able to add a very small
         stool.

<b>                   BERTIE
</b>         Two comfortable chairs. One for Madam
         Logue. She's a close friend of my wife. The
         Queen.

<b>                   COSMO LANG
</b>         I'll have someone attend to it.

<b>                   LIONEL
</b>         And now, if you don't mind, we need the
         premises.

<b>                   COSMO LANG
</b>         My dear fellow, this is Westminster Abbey!
         The Church must make preparations.

<b>                   LIONEL
</b>         So must Bertie.

<b>                   COSMO LANG
</b>         Bertie?! We do not call the King: "Bertie"!
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                        95.


<b>                       LIONEL
</b>            I do. During waking hours we'll need the
            facilities. It'll be a closed set. No
            observers.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Those are my wishes, Your Grace.

Lang nods curtly and exits.

<b>                      BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>            You've made a dangerous enemy.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Wouldn't want him as a friend.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            And don't ever call me Bertie in public.

A moment of confrontation.    Lionel knows he's overstepped.

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>            Tell me...

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I sense one of your dreadful questions on
            the horizon.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Do you really want to be King?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Knew it! I haven't any choice.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            You can be a wounded King who stumbles
            through his Coronation. Or, as the Arch of
            C so archly suggests, no Coronation at all.
            Always a choice.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            What's this, you wait til Westminster
            Abbey, then ambush me?

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I'm simply asking questions... which you
            seem unable to answer.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I'm a sacrificial lamb being led to
            slaughter! Damn you!
   TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     96.


<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Quite possibly. But at least I know what I
            want. You haven't the foggiest.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>                (explodes)
<b>            I WANT TO BE HEARD!
</b>
His words reverberate through the empty abbey.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            That's quite different. Let's get down to
            work then, shall we?

Bertie glares at him.

<b>                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>            As soon as you and Elizabeth enter the West
            door, you'll be greeted with the hymn "I
            Was Glad When They Said Unto Me." You won't
            actually be that glad, because they sing it
            for a great long time.

Bertie follows Logue deep into the bowels of the `Abbey'.

<b>                      LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>            You'll then show yourself to the various
            sides of the Abbey as the Archbishop
            announces four times in a loud voice,
            "Sirs, I here present unto you..." Have you
            decided your name for when you become King?
            For when you become a different person?

<b>                        BERTIE
</b>            George.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Like your father?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Like my father.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Not Albert?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Given the current situation...too Germanic.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>             "Sirs, I here present unto you, GEORGE,
            your undoubted King!"
        TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   97.


     "George, your undoubted King!" echoes through the Abby.

     Lang is on the phone. The door is open. While talking he
     watches the work preparations. On the phone he tells someone:

<b>                           COSMO LANG
</b>                 I've made inquiries.

     Logue enters and sits at the table. Myrtle serves him.

<b>                           MYRTLE
</b>                 A bit dry. Tried to keep it warm.

</b>                 You look done in.

</b>                 I've news for you. You're coming to the

<b>                           MYRTLE
</b>                 I've news for you. I'm not!

<b>                              LIONEL

<b>                           LIONEL
</b>                 Royal Box. You and I.

     Stunned silence, then.

<b>                           MYRTLE
</b>                 Lionel...I'd need a new dress.

<b>                           LIONEL

     Valentine calls from the next room:

     a glass-fronted cabinet. Even does a curtsey.

</b>
     The last of the preparation crew are being scurried out by Lang.
     He gives a final, satisfied, look at the cavernous space, like a
     director preparing the stage for a final scene. He quotes
     Shakespeare, extremely pleased with himself:

<b>                            COSMO LANG
</b>                  "The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch
                  the conscience of a King."

     He exits.

     THE CAMERA explores various elements:

     The Throne of Edward the Confessor.

     Beneath it, a large rough-hewn stone: The Stone Of Scone.

     Leaning against the Throne, a huge sword, set there for the next
     Coronation rehearsal.

     Majestic stained glass windows of saints, kings, and martyrs.

     Rows of pews, worn with centuries of use.

     Graves of the mighty: kings, poets, and statesmen.

     This Abbey holds the history of a nation.

     Footsteps resonate.

     Lionel enters.   Trips over one of the gravestones.

<b>                             LIONEL

                  Bertie...?

     Lights snap on skewering Lionel. Bertie steps into view wearing
     a coat against the night chill of the stone cathedral.

<b>                            BERTIE

<b>                   LIONEL
</b>         Ah, the Star Chamber inquisition. I
         wondered when that would happen. And I'd
         promised Myrtle a new frock.

<b>                   BERTIE

         "Just call me Lionel"! Never did you call

         a great deal of nerve.

<b>                   BERTIE

<b>                    LIONEL

</b>          An actor?!

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>          When the war came, by the time I was ready
          to be shipped out, the first casualties
          were limping home. Poor buggers, broken in
          bone and spirit. `Lionel, you're good with
          your mouth, see if you can help these poor
          sods.' The shell-shocked were the saddest.
          Most stuttered profoundly. Far worse than
          you. Muscle therapy helped somewhat, but I
          found I had to go deeper, as you might well
          imagine.

<b>                    BERTIE
</b>          I know nothing of those poor men!

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>          I think you do. They had cried out, and the
          universe had not listened. So they'd lost
          faith in their voice. My job was to make
          them shout in righteous anger: "I have the
          right to be heard!"

<b>                    BERTIE
</b>          I suppose that helped them, did it?

</b>            Not in Western Australia, not at that time.
            I simply knew what to do. When the war was
            over I kept being a therapist to earn a
            living. When the lads were old enough, I
            thought, "Alright Lionel, you've always
            wanted to be an actor, one last go." I
            pretended it was our trip home to Mother
            England, the Great Australian Pilgrimage.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            So you set yourself up on Harley Street as

            the diggers I'd helped had come to England.
            They made referrals. My practice
            flourished. My acting, however, did not.

                 the altar divested of your robes. Trumpets
                 echo through the Abbey. The incessant rain

                 streams through the stained-glass window
                 catching your golden tunic and bathing you
                 in light like a mediaeval knight. And you
                 are King!

     The faint CLICKING WHIR of a film projector is heard.

     David and Wallis visiting the Fuhrer in Germany: Hitler
     gallantly kissing Mrs Simpson's hand while Goring and the Duke
     of Windsor beam; David giving the Nazi salute. FREEZE FRAME.

                  miraculously survived the Coronation he
                  continues to stumble very badly indeed.
                  Soon he must broadcast to the world. Hitler

            one-two-three- four "... we are at war."
            Three, four.

Dancing at arm's length with Logue, Bertie repeats:

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            "For the second time... in the lives of
            most of us... we are at war." One-two-
            three. (continues on)
             "Over and over again... we have tried to
            find a peaceful way... out of the
            differences... between ourselves... and
            those who are now our enemies." Bugger,
            bugger, bugger! Fuck, fuck, fuck!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            You'll be ready.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>                (pause)
            The shilling you won... still have it?

<b>                         LIONEL
</b>            Of course.
       TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   108.


     Bertie holds out his hand, demandingly. Somewhat hurt, Lionel
     hands it over.

<b>                            BERTIE
</b>                  I'll return it.

     Bertie leaves with the shilling, exiting the back way.

     Logue opens the waiting room door.

<b>                            LIONEL
</b>                  Willie! Where's your mum?

<b>                            WILLIE
</b>                      (stuttering painfully)
                  She had to work.

<b>                            LIONEL
</b>                  You've been waiting here, alone, all this
                  time?

     Willie nods again. Then, haltingly:

<b>                            WILLIE
</b>                  I heard the King.

<b>                              LIONEL
</b>                  Did you?

<b>                            WILLIE
</b>                  He sang. And shouted rude words.

<b>                              LIONEL
</b>                  He did.

     Willie beams.

<b>                            LIONEL (CONT'D)
</b>                  Would you like to sing, dance, and shout
                  rude words?

<b>                              WILLIE (NO STUTTER)
</b>                  I would!

<b>                            LIONEL
</b>                  Why am I not surprised?


<b>87   INT.   KING'S STUDY, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - NEW NIGHT          87
</b>
     The dreaded BBC microphone.

     The room has been transformed into an ad hoc broadcasting studio
     for this all-important occasion.
  TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    109.


The BBC News Reader and Floor Manager are there, along with a
small cluster of technicians putting finishing touches to their
equipment.

<b>                      FLOOR MANAGER
</b>            Think he'll manage?

<b>                      BBC NEWS READER
</b>            I've heard he may not even show.

The Floor Manager tries to warn him with his eyes.

Bertie has entered with Elizabeth and Logue. The Reader wishes
he could sink into the floor. Bertie says nothing, but
approaches the looming microphone, while Logue and Elizabeth
watch nervously.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            `Walk up to the bloody thing boldly, stare
            it square in the eye, man to man.'

<b>                      BBC NEWS READER
</b>                (placating)
            If you'll be so kind, to let me show you...

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            I already know. My father taught me.

He spreads the fingers of one hand, touches the apparatus with
the little finger, thumb to chin.

The Reader scurries off and tells the others.

<b>                      BBC NEWS READER
</b>            His father taught him. I taught his father.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>                (testing the microphone)
            Bugger bugger bugger...bloody bloody
            bloody...

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            Bertie, do make sure that's not switched
            on!

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            You're going to be splendid. And
            if you're not?

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            They'll bloody well have to listen to me
            anyway. Right?
  TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    110.


<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Bloody right.

Lang and Churchill have entered. Elizabeth forces herself to
greet them graciously.

<b>                      ELIZABETH
</b>            Mr. Prime Minister, Your Grace, how kind of
            you to join us.

<b>                      COSMO LANG
</b>            Wouldn't miss this for the world.
                (to Churchill)
            Congratulations. Neville didn't last long,
            did he? Talking to Hitler.

<b>                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
</b>            My tenure will be shorter, if the King
            fails tonight.

Bertie and Logue speak privately.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            No matter how this turns out, I wish to
            thank you. For asking such dreadful
            questions. What can I do in recompense?

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>                (lighty...yet seriously)
            I've always wanted to be knighted.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Sorry. That would raise too many questions.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>                (pause, then)
            Understood.

Bertie takes something from his pocket.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            Your shilling. Told you I'd give it back.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Keep it for good luck.

<b>                      BERTIE
</b>            No, you won this, fair and square.

The object is a silver medal. Bertie pins it to Logue's jacket.
  TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    111.


<b>                      BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>            Made from the melted coin. Designed it
            myself, hope you like it, Lionel old
            friend. May I call you that?

<b>                       LIONEL
</b>            My greatest honour, Bertie.
                (then)
            One final question.

<b>                         BERTIE
</b>            Oh dear.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            Do you believe you're King?

A very long pause.

<b>                         BERTIE
</b>            Almost.

The red light on the microphone starts to blink.   Logue joins
the others.

The Reader is at a smaller microphone near the ad hoc `broadcast
booth. Five, four, three, two...

<b>                      BBC NEWS READER
</b>            Good evening, this is the BBC National and
            World programme, broadcasting from
            Buckingham Palace. His Majesty, the King.

During this, Bertie's hands begin to shake, the pages of his
speech rattle like dry leaves, his throat muscles constrict, the
Adam's apple bulges, his lips tighten...all the old symptoms
reappear.

Several seconds have elapsed since the Reader finished.   It
seems an eternity.

Elizabeth grasps the sides of her chair with white knuckles.

Lang's eyes roll heavenward.

Churchill studies the situation, ready to leap into the breach.

Bertie and Logue stare at each other.

Logue smiles, perfectly calm, totally confident in the man he's
worked with. His confidence is contagious.

Bertie takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. His hands
grow steady, his throat muscles relax...all the things he's
practiced.

<b>88   INT.   LOGUE'S PARLOUR - NIGHT                                 88
</b>
     The luminous dial of a wireless.   Unbearable silence. Then:

<b>                            BERTIE (V.O. RADIO FILTER)
</b>                  In this grave hour, perhaps the most
                  fateful in our history, I send to every
                  household of my peoples, both at home and
                  overseas...

     This is being listened to by Myrtle and the boys. The boys look
     at their mum. Suddenly they explode with cheers as the radio
     address continues:


<b>89   INT./EXT. MONTAGE OF VARIOUS LOCATIONS IN ENGLAND AND AROUND 89
</b><b>                                                                  THE
</b><b>     WORLD - NIGHT OR DAY, DEPENDING ON LOCATION
</b>
     In homes, pubs (where we see the man with the rosacea nose),
     clubs, hotels, boarding houses, factories, mines, prisons, a
     shearing shed in New Zealand, cattle station in Australia, sites
     in India, South Africa, loci around the Commonwealth and Empire.
     China. Japan. The Kremlin. The White House. Hitler's mountain
     top wolf den. The South of France (where David and Wallis listen
     dolefully.)

     During this, the address continues, with dramatic pauses to be
     sure, but no real hesitations.

<b>                            BERTIE (V.O. ON RADIO)
</b>                  ...this message spoken with the same depth
                  of feeling for each one of you as if I were
                  able to cross your threshold and speak to
                  you myself. For the second time in the
                  lives of most of us we are at war. For we
                  are called, with our allies, to meet the
                  challenge of a principle which, if it were
                  to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized
                  order in the world. It is the principle
                  which permits a State, in the selfish
                  pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties
                  and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the
                  use of force, or threat of force, against
                  the sovereignty and independence of other
                  States. Such a principle, stripped of all
                  disguise, is surely the mere primitive
                  doctrine that might is right, and if this
                  principle were established throughout the
                  world, the freedom of our own country and
                  of the whole British Commonwealth of
                  Nations would be in danger.

<b>                            BERTIE (V.O. ON RADIO) (CONT'D)
</b>                  But far more than this - the peoples of the
                  world would be kept in the bondage of fear,
                  and all hopes of settled peace and of the
                  security of justice and liberty among
                  nations would be ended. This is the
                  ultimate issue which confronts us.

     End the montage with a return to the exterior of Buckingham
     Palace. Outside, stand solemn crowds, listening to the speech
     on loudspeakers. PAN THEIR FACES, the faces of England,
     stalwart and resolved.

<b>                            BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>                  For the sake of all that we ourselves hold
                  dear, and of the world's order and peace,
                  it is unthinkable that we should refuse to
                  meet the challenge. It is to this high
                  purpose that I now call my people at home
                  and my peoples across the seas, who will
                  make our cause their own. I ask them to
                  stand calm, firm, and united in this time
                  of trial. The task will be hard. There may
                  be dark days ahead, and war can no longer
                  be confined to the battlefield. But we can
                  only do the right as we see the right, and
                  reverently commit our cause to God.

     The two girls listen to their father on the radio.

<b>                            BERTIE (V.O. ON RADIO)
</b>                  If one and all we keep resolutely faithful
                  to it, ready for whatever service or
                  sacrifice it may demand, then, with God's
                  help, we shall prevail.

     Lilibet's expression tells it all - she can hear it, her father
     is truly King.



<b>91   INT. KING'S STUDY/BROADCAST ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE -         91
</b><b>     CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Bertie, in his quiet way is totally in command, and utterly
     magnificent. Everyone in the room is awed as he concludes:
  TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   114.


<b>                      BERTIE (CONT'D)
</b>            We may all find a message of encouragement
            in the lines which, in my closing words, I
            would like to say to you: `I said to the
            man who stood at the Gate of the Year,
            "Give me a light that I may tread safely
            into the unknown." And he replied, "Go out
            into the darkness, and put your hand into
            the Hand of God. That shall be to you
            better than light, and safer than a known
            way.'" May the Almighty Hand guide and
            uphold us all.

IN THE AD HOC `CONTROL BOOTH' AREA - the Manager makes a `cut'
gesture to Bertie, he's off the air, the red light on the
microphone goes out. The Manager points, and the red light on
the Reader's microphone goes on.

<b>                      BBC NEWS READER
</b>            This concludes the BBC broadcast of the
            King's Speech.

Another `cut' gesture from the Floor Manager, the red light goes
out and the transmission is concluded. The Floor Manager looks
to the Reader.

<b>                      BBC NEWS READER (CONT'D)
</b>                (softly)
            He wasn't perfect.
                (barely controlling his
                 tears)
            Not perfect... But by God... He moved me.

AT THE MAIN BBC MICROPHONE - Bertie waits for the verdict of his
peers. Churchill first:

<b>                      WINSTON CHURCHILL
</b>            Couldn't have said it better myself.

The ultimate compliment.   Lang next.

<b>                      COSMO LANG
</b>            I'm speechless.

<b>                       ELIZABETH
</b>                (softly)
            Thank God.

She goes to Bertie and kisses him tenderly on the cheek, takes
his hand, then Logue's.
  TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   115.


<b>                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>            Well done, Bertie. Well done...
                (for the first time)
            ...Lionel. Well done.

She leaves the two men together.

<b>                      LIONEL
</b>            I always called you Bertie. Today, I call
            you King.

He offers his hand. But instead of taking it, Bertie takes him
by the shoulders and gives him a hug. This is a long way from
the five pace rule. The last barrier has fallen.
