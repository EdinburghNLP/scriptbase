Maya is a CIA operative whose first experience is in the interrogation of prisoners following the Al Qaeda attacks against the U.S. on the 11th September 2001.
She is a reluctant participant in extreme duress applied to the detainees, but believes that the truth may only be obtained through such tactics.
For several years, she is single-minded in her pursuit of leads to uncover the whereabouts of Al Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden.
Finally, in 2011, it appears that her work will pay off, and a U.S. Navy SEAL team is sent to kill or capture Bin Laden.
But only Maya is confident Bin Laden is where she says he is.
