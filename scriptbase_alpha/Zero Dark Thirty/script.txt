          FROM BLACK, VOICES EMERGE--
          We hear the actual recorded emergency calls made by World
          Trade Center office workers to police and fire departments
          after the planes struck on 9/11, just before the buildings
          collapsed.

          TITLE OVER: SEPTEMBER 11, 2001
          We listen to fragments from a number of these calls...starting
          with pleas for help, building to a panic, ending with the
          caller's grim acceptance that help will not arrive, that the
          situation is hopeless, that they are about to die.

                         DANIEL
          I own you, Ammar. You belong to me.
          Look at me.
          This is DANIEL STANTON, the CIA's man in Islamabad - a big
          American, late 30's, with a long, anarchical beard snaking
          down to his tattooed neck. He looks like a paramilitary
          hipster, a punk rocker with a Glock.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          (explaining the rules)
          If you don't look at me when I talk
          to you, I hurt you. If you step off
          this mat, I hurt you. If you lie to
          me, I'm gonna hurt you. Now, Look
          at me.
          His prisoner, AMMAR, stands on a decaying gym mat, surrounded
          by four GUARDS whose faces are covered in ski masks.
          Ammar looks down. Instantly: the guards rush Ammar, punching
          and kicking.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Look at me, Ammar.
          Notably, one of the GUARDS wearing a ski mask does not take
          part in the beating.

          EXT. BLACK SITE - LATER

          Daniel and the masked figures emerge from the interrogation
          room into the light of day. They remove their masks and we
          see that one is a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties.
          She has a pale, milky innocence and bright blue eyes, thin
          and somewhat frail looking, yet possessing a steely core
          that we will come to realize is off-the-charts. This is
          MAYA, a CIA targeter and subject-matter expert on her first
          overseas assignment.

                         DANIEL
          (to the guard)
          Are we gonna board up these windows
          or what?

                         (TO MAYA)
          Just off the plane from Washington,
          you're rocking your best suit for
          your first interrogation, and then
          you get this guy. It's not always
          this intense.

                         MAYA
          I'm fine.
          She's not.

                         DANIEL
          Just so you know, it's going to take
          awhile. He has to learn how helpless
          he is. Let's get a coffee.

                         MAYA
          No, we should go back in.
          Something about the strange intensity of her expression makes
          Daniel reconsider and he turns back to the interrogation
          room.

                         DANIEL
          You know, there's no shame if you
          wanna watch from the monitor.
          She shakes her head.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Alright.
          At the door, Daniel hands the ski mask back to Maya.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          You might want to put this on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         MAYA
          You're not wearing one. Is he ever
          getting out?

                         DANIEL
          Never.

          INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER


          SUPERIMPOSE: CIA BLACK SITE - UNDISCLOSED LOCATION
          Ammar, bruised from the beating, is restrained with ropes.
          Maya stands a few feet behind Daniel, attentive, wary of
          what is to come. This is her first interrogation and she is
          on the verge of vomiting from the stench in the room. She
          looks around at the sound-proofed walls, the puddles of water
          on the floor.

                         DANIEL
          Right now, this is about you coming
          to terms with your situation. It's
          you and me, bro. I want you to
          understand that I know you, that
          I've been studying you for a very
          long time. I could have had you
          killed Karachi. But I let you live
          so you and I could talk.

                         AMMAR

                         (RESISTANT)
          You beat me when my hands are tied.
          I won't talk to you.

                         DANIEL
          Life isn't always fair, my friend.
          Did you really think that when we
          got you, I'd be a nice fucking guy?

                         AMMAR
          You're a mid-level guy. You're a
          garbage man in a corporation. Why
          should I respect you?

                         DANIEL
          And you're a money man. A paperboy!
          Daniel paces around Ammar, anger rising.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          A disgrace to humanity!

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          You and your uncle murdered three
          thousand innocent people. I have
          your name on a five-thousand dollar
          transfer via Western Union to a 9/11
          hijacker.
          He leans into Ammar's ear. Uncomfortably close.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          And you got popped with 150 kilograms
          of high explosives in your house!

          AND THEN YOU DARE QUESTION ME?!
          And then Daniel smiles, laughs. Mercurial.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          I'm just fucking with you.
          Beat. He laughs again.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          I don't want to talk about 9/11.
          What I want to focus on is the Saudi
          group.
          Daniel shows him a photo.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          That there is Hazem al-Kashmiri.
          And I know this dude is up to some
          serious shit, and what I want from
          you is his Saudi email.

                         (PAUSE)
          Feel free to jump in.

                         (PAUSE)
          Ammar, bro, I know that you know
          this dude, just give me his
          email...and I will give you a blanket.
          I will give you a blanket and some
          solid food.
          No response from Ammar. Daniel starts putting on his gloves.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          I know that you know him.

                         AMMAR
          I told you before, I won't talk to
          you.

                         DANIEL
          Have it your way.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          (to the masks)
          Let's go.
          It all happens in a flash: in one swift motion, Daniel pushes
          Ammar to the floor, the guards pin his limbs, and Daniel
          smothers Ammar's face with a towel.
          Ammar thrashes. Daniel considers his next move.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)

                         (TO MAYA)
          Grab the bucket.
          Maya follows Daniel's gesture to the corner of the room,
          where there's an ICE CHEST filled with WATER and a PLASTIC

          PITCHER.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Put some water in it.
          She dips the pitcher in the water, hands shaking.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          C'mon, let's go.
          The stress and strain on her face is enormous as she brings
          the bucket back to Daniel.
          Daniel starts pouring the water on Ammar's face, which is
          now covered by a towel. Ammar thrashes with rising panic.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Hazem was a friend of Ramzi Yousef,
          you guys met in Tunisia back in the
          70s.

                         AMMAR
          (gasping for breath)
          I don't know, you asshole.
          Maya shakes her head "no."

                         MAYA
          That's not credible.

                         AMMAR

                         (SCREAMING)
          Why are you doing this to me?

                         DANIEL
          You're a terrorist, that's why I'm
          doing it to you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         AMMAR
          Fuck you.
          Daniel pours water over the towel so it hits Ammar's nose.

                         DANIEL
          I want emails of the rest of the
          Saudi group. Give me emails of the
          rest of the Saudi group! Give me
          one email, and I will stop this!
          Ammar doesn't speak. He can't.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Who's in the Saudi group, and what's
          the target? Where was the last time
          you saw bin Laden? WHERE WAS THE

          LAST TIME YOU SAW BIN LADEN?
          Daniel throws the pitcher, rips the rag off Ammar's mouth:
          and water spurts out - Ammar nearly drowned. He gasps for
          air.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          This is what defeat looks like, bro.
          Your jihad is over.
          Daniel stands.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Get him up.
          The guards bring Ammar to his feet.
          Daniel, shifting his persona yet again, touches Ammar's face
          and speaks to him with the comforting tenor of a therapist.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Try to understand the concept here.
          I have time, you don't. I have other
          things to do, you don't.

                         (BEAT)
          It's cool that you're strong. I
          respect it, I do. But in the end,
          everybody breaks, bro. It's biology.
          Dan and Maya exit.
          They've learned nothing.

          former case officer who hasn't quite buffed all the blood
          out of his fingernails.

                         BRADLEY
          How did it go the other night?

                         DANIEL
          It was good. The local cops need
          tactical help. But he's Tier fucking

          They reach the lobby, where they can see Maya sitting in the

          Permission granted, Daniel reassures his boss.

          Daniel knocks on the glass for Maya to come in.

          Maya, this is Joseph Bradley, our

          (as they shake hands)
          Joe and I did Iraq together.

          And we continue our Christian mission

          How was your flight?
          They walk down the lobby towards the Secure Wing.

          No.
          Bradley smiles. He knew she didn't volunteer.
          They reach a secure area and Bradley checks Maya through an
          electronic door.

          She goes through and Daniel and Bradley watch her walk away.

                         DANIEL
          Don't you think she's a little young
          for the hard stuff?

                         BRADLEY
          Washington says she's a killer.

                         DANIEL
          The children's crusade.

                         BRADLEY
          They want the next generation on the
          field. Listen, I have a meeting
          with ISI in twenty minutes.

                         DANIEL
          They're slow rolling us in Lahore -
          you might want to bitch about that.

                         BRADLEY
          Did you see the cable from London?

                         DANIEL
          Dude, I've been in a dark room with
          another man for the last two days.

          INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - MAYA'S CUBICLE

          Maya finds her desk. It's covered with grime. She tries to
          clean it as best she can, then sits and looks at the blank
          log-in screen of her computer.

          INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - CONFERENCE ROOM

          A group of thirty-somethings filing in for a meeting,
          chatting, comradery, taking seats around a conference table.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.
          We will get to know:
          JACK, mid-40s, a scruffy teddy bear, the liaison from the
          National Security Agency (NSA).
          JESSICA, 30s, an experienced targeter, and the only woman in
          the station who wears a skirt.

                         JACK
          Some dude tells the Malaysian station
          that his nephew works with a guy who
          knows a guy--

                         JESSICA
          Here we go.

                         JACK
          Hold on - He goes to a big feast in
          Bangkok about a year ago. The guest
          of honor? Usama bin Laden.
          Laughter in the room.

                         JACK (CONT'D)
          So I say, was Tupac there too?

                         JESSICA
          Right, but you forgot - you forgot
          Mullah Omar.
          J.J. and JEREMY, two case officers, continue the banter:

                         JEREMY

                         (SARCASTICALLY)
          This is worth 5 million bucks.

          J.J.
          You know we're going to have to chase
          it down.

                         JEREMY
          That's me, man. No job too small.

                         JACK
          That's why I have a gift for you, my
          friend.
          Jack hands Jeremy a piece of paper. Daniel and Maya enter,
          a little late.

                         DANIEL
          Everyone, this is Maya. Maya,
          everyone.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Please don't ask how it's going with
          Ammar because she's not going to
          fucking tell you.

                         JESSICA
          Ammar is withholding?
          Daniel nods.

                         JESSICA (CONT'D)
          (reading from her

                         FILE)
          Washington assesses that Abu Faraj
          is officially our new number three -
          JESSICA moves to a wall chart of AQ leadership and repositions
          Abu Faraj's mugshot to number three in the line, two down
          from Usama bin Laden. Meanwhile, in the background, the
          riffs continue -

                         DANIEL
          - Best man for it.

          JACK (O.S.)
          London station is already asking if
          we think he's in contact with anyone
          in the U.K.

                         JEREMY
          Like we're just keeping it from them.
          Jessica sits back down and gets down to business.

                         JESSICA
          The Jordanians are being really
          helpful with Ammar's transit papers.
          Jessica passes Daniel a file.

                         DANIEL
          Any imminent threats in here?

                         JESSICA
          They want the Consulate, the Marriott,
          it's low security. And they've got
          Majid Kahn talking about gas stations
          in the US.

                         DANIEL
          And that's a conversation?
          Jessica shrugs. At this point, she believes that it is merely
          a conversation - not a fully realized plot.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         JESSICA
          Honestly? There are six hundred
          questions in there. I'd concentrate
          on Heathrow. The Saudis. Does it
          matter what Faraj thinks about
          Heathrow? How much latitude does he
          get to pick targets?

                         DANIEL
          I think he'll give up the Saudis.
          But Heathrow is gonna be tough.
          Anyway. Anything from last night?

          J.J.
          Quetta base thinks they have a bead
          on the Arabs that escaped, and they're
          going to meet with the ISI this
          afternoon, hopefully to set up a
          raid down there.

                         DANIEL
          Great.

                         JEREMY
          And Lahore reporting ISI down there
          was painfully slow last night. Again.
          I'm beginning to think it's not
          incompetence.

                         DANIEL
          I agree, I spoke to the Chief about
          that. Anything on bin Laden?

                         JESSICA
          (reading from a cable)
          A farmer on the Afghan border near
          Tora Bora reports: a diamond shaped
          pattern in the hills, tall male in
          the center of the diamond, flanked
          by four guards. It's consistent
          with UBL's movements.

                         JEREMY
          That's supposed to be his royal guard?

                         MAYA
          That's pre-9/11 behavior.
          Jessica doesn't appreciate the challenge.

                         JESSICA

                         (CHILLY)
          We don't have reason to believe he's
          changed security tactics.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         MAYA
          We invaded Afghanistan. That's a
          reason.
          And so the rivalry begins.

          J.J.
          Hey, boss, I got a guy for five
          thousand bucks, he can set up a taxi
          stand and snoop around a bit.

                         DANIEL
          No, don't need him, the diamond
          sighting is bullshit. See if the
          Paks will send someone to talk to
          the farmer. Anything else? We need
          to be putting runs on the board
          against Faraj. Speak to the case
          officers who didn't see fit to make
          it today. And thank them.

          INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - ISLAMABAD

          The loud WAILING of the early morning call to prayer from
          the loudspeakers of a nearby mosque wakes Maya on the couch.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BLACK SITE - AFTERNOON

          Daniel and the guards enter Ammar's cell with Maya. Daniel
          switches on a floodlight, awakening Ammar.

                         DANIEL
          Let's take it easy today, huh?
          Daniel hands Ammar a bottle of orange juice and a bag of
          falafel.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Hungry? The food in here sucks so I
          got you some of this.
          Ammar grabs the lunch sack and scarfs down the falafels.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Richard Reid, wow. I was thinking
          about him. The guy gets a bomb in
          his shoe on a plane. Unbelievable.
          You know him, don't you?
          Slowly, Ammar nods.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         AMMAR
          Yes.

                         DANIEL
          I'm glad you said that. I have an
          email from you to him. I've had all
          your coms for years, bro. Who else
          is in your Saudi group?

                         AMMAR
          I just handed out some cash for them.
          I didn't know who the guys were.

                         DANIEL
          When you lie to me, I hurt you.

                         AMMAR
          Please.

                         DANIEL
          I believe you. I do, I believe you.
          Beat.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Do you want the water again, or do
          you want something else?

                         AMMAR
          Please.

                         DANIEL
          Just give me a name.

                         AMMAR

                         I DON'T--
          Daniel jumps up.

                         AMMAR (CONT'D)
          I don't know.
          Daniel kicks out the chair from under Ammar. The masked
          guards walk to the rope pulleys.

                         DANIEL
          You see how this works? You don't
          mind if my female colleague sees
          your junk, do you?
          Daniel pulls down Ammar's pants. Maya flinches at the bare
          nakedness.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Dude, you shit your pants.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.
          Daniel turns to Maya -

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          You stay here, I'll be back.
          Daniel goes out, leaving Maya standing alone in front of the
          naked, chained man.
          Ammar looks at her imploringly and she struggles to meet his
          eyes.

                         AMMAR
          Your friend is an animal. Please,
          help me. Please.
          A long beat.

                         MAYA
          You can help yourself by being
          truthful.
          The door handle turns. It occurs to Maya that perhaps Daniel
          was testing her resilience, too, as Daniel re-enters with a
          DOG COLLAR in his hand.

                         DANIEL
          This is a dog collar.
          Daniel unhooks Ammar, snaps the collar and leash around his
          neck, as Ammar cries out against the humiliation.
          Maya flinches. Daniel is relentless:

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          You determine how I treat you.
          Now Daniel drags Ammar on all fours, pulling him by the leash.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          I'm going to walk you.
          Maya watches in horror as Daniel walks Ammar to a far corner
          of the room, then leans down to address his victim:

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          What the fuck do you think is going
          on, Ammar? Wahleed has already told
          me that you know.
          At last, Daniel reaches an area of the room where there is a
          large wooden box resting on a platform.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          This box sucks. I'm going to put
          you in it.
          Ammar tries to speak but can't get a word out.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          When is the attack?

                         AMMAR

                         (VERY SOFTLY)
          Sunday.

                         DANIEL
          Sunday? Sunday where? This Sunday
          or next Sunday?
          Ammar mumbles, almost inaudibly.

                         AMMAR
          Monday.

                         DANIEL
          Is it Sunday or Monday?
          Ammar doesn't answer. The masked men approach.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Which day is it? Partial information
          is treated as a lie.

                         AMMAR
          Saturday.
          Beat. The masked men open the box.

                         AMMAR (CONT'D)
          Sunday!
          The guards grab Ammar and carry him to his wooden tomb. He
          shouts with his last reserve of energy:

                         AMMAR (CONT'D)
          Monday!

                         DANIEL
          Ammar, which day?

                         AMMAR

                         (MUMBLING)
          Monday, Tuesday,
          Beat.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         AMMAR (CONT'D)
          Thursday.
          Beat.

                         AMMAR (CONT'D)
          Friday.
          Daniel slams the box shut. Once again, he's learned nothing.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. KHOBAR TOWERS - SAUDI ARABIA - DAY

          ECU: a magazine CLICKS into the receiver of a black assault
          rifle.
          The weapon, carried by a BEARDED ARAB MAN dressed in street
          clothes, rises to shoulder height.

          INT. KHOBAR TOWERS - DAY

          - The man enters the hallway of the KHOBAR RESIDENTIAL TOWERS
          - And immediately opens fire on TWO WESTERN MEN he happens
          to find inside, killing them both.

          TITLE OVER: MAY 29, 2004
          - The CRACK of the shots sends the rest of the residents
          into a panicky, screaming dash for cover
          - As he strides quickly down the hall, he finds three other
          RESIDENTS scrambling for safety, and shoots and kills them
          all.

          Yeah, now.

                         JESSICA
          You warned them - they didn't take
          you seriously - this is what happens.
          It's not on you.

                         DANIEL
          Who said that? Zied? Fuck him.
          This is on me. Ammar is on me!!
          And it's on her!!
          (pointing to Maya)
          We can't let this be a win-win for

          AQ.

                         JESSICA
          No, no, no. You had - what - days -
          brief custody - and an unresponsive
          ally. The way you do this is you
          look ahead. London. Heathrow. Mass
          casualties. That plan is still
          active.

                         MAYA
          Ammar doesn't have a clue about what
          happened.

                         JESSICA
          He knows.

                         MAYA
          How?

                         JESSICA
          You have to be really careful with
          people in KSM's circle - they're
          devious.

                         MAYA
          He's not going to talk about attacks
          on the homeland. He's going to
          withhold operational details on the
          KSM network and probably on bin Laden.
          (flipping her argument)
          But he's been in complete isolation,
          he doesn't know we failed. We can
          tell him anything.

                         DANIEL
          Bluff him?

                         MAYA
          He hasn't slept, Dan. He's clueless.

          EXT. BLACK SITE - AFTERNOON


                         DANIEL (PRE-LAP)
          You don't remember, do you? You -
          me: same same. Bad memory.
          While GUARDS move in the deep b.g., Daniel and Maya are seated
          at a picnic table with an appetizing spread of Arabic food.

          DANIEL (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
          Short term memory loss is a side
          effect of sleep deprivation. It
          should come back to you.
          The Guards bring a prisoner to the table and remove his hood:
          Ammar. He stares weakly at the table.

                         AMMAR

                         (CAREFULLY)
          I don't know. How can I remember?

                         MAYA
          After we kept you awake for 96 hours,
          you gave us names of some of your
          brothers and saved the lives of a
          lot of innocent people.

                         DANIEL
          Which is the smart thing to do, you're
          starting to think for yourself.
          Ammar is lost. But the food is tempting.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Eat up! You earned it.
          Ammar eats.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          So you flew via Amman to Kabul to
          hang out with your uncle? Mukhtar.

                         AMMAR
          How did you know that?

                         DANIEL
          I told you man, I know you. Alright,
          you got me - flight manifests. It
          must've been pretty fucked up for
          you guys after 9/11. What did you
          do after the invasion and before you
          went back to Pesh?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         AMMAR
          After 9/11 I had to choose: fight,
          to protect our turf - or run.

                         DANIEL

                         (SYMPATHETIC)
          You chose to fight.
          Ammar looks Daniel right in the eyes.

                         AMMAR
          I wanted to kill Americans. We tried
          to get into Tora Bora but the bombing
          was too high. We couldn't cross.

                         MAYA
          Sorry, who is the "we" in that
          sentence?

                         AMMAR
          Me and some guys who were hanging
          around at that time.

                         DANIEL

                         (CASUALLY)
          I can eat with some other dude and
          hook you back up to the ceiling?

                         AMMAR
          Hamza Rabia, Khabab al-Masri, and
          Abu Ahmed.
          Maya makes notes on her pad.

                         MAYA
          Who's Abu Ahmed? I've heard of the
          other guys.

                         AMMAR
          He was a computer guy with us at the
          time. After Tora Bora, I went back
          to Pesh - as you know - and he went
          North, I think, to Kunar.

                         MAYA
          What's his family name?

                         AMMAR
          Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti.

                         MAYA
          Abu Ahmed means "father of Ahmed",
          it's a kunya.

          21.

                         MAYA (CONT'D)
          Ammar, I know the difference between
          a war name and an Arabic name.

                         DANIEL
          She got you there, dude.

                         AMMAR
          I swear to you both: I don't know
          his family name. I would have never
          asked him something like that. It's
          not how my uncle worked. My uncle
          told me he worked for bin Laden. I
          did see him, once, about a year ago,
          in Karachi. He read us all a letter
          from the Sheikh.

                         MAYA
          A letter?

                         DANIEL
          What did it say?
          Daniel offers Ammar a smoke.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Cigarette?
          Ammar accepts. Daniel's lights it.

                         AMMAR
          It said "Continue the jihad. The
          work will go on for a hundred years."

          We fade into a dimly lit research room, where Maya is alone
          watching interrogation video recordings on an array of
          monitors. Some of the videos are rough; but most simply
          depict two people talking. The video she's watching now shows
          a hooded prisoner sitting in a filthy room, the walls smeared
          with red stains.

          You and I are gonna talk about some
          of the guys in the training camps,
          yeah?
          The prisoner sits in a chair. He's hooded, but relaxed.

          Ok.

                         SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
          Some of these brothers have done
          some bad things, and what I want to
          do is I want to separate them from
          the people like you.

                         PRISONER
          Definitely, yeah.

                         SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
          There was a guy called Abu Ahmed
          from Kuwait.

                         PRISONER
          Yes, I remember him. A nice guy.

                         SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
          How close was he? What was his
          relationship to the leadership?

                         PRISONER
          I don't know.

                         SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
          Did he eat with you guys - did he
          eat with the good guys - or did he
          eat with the leadership?

                         PRISONER
          I don't know, sir. I have no idea
          about things like that.

                         SOLDIER INTERROGATOR
          Yes you do, you don't need an idea

                         ABOUT THINGS-
          Maya hits pause and we see that her desk is filled with open
          windows of interrogations: she is analyzing ten videos
          simultaneously, comparing them to each other.

          Correct. You're assuming that greed

          aged Afghan man, thick shouldered with years of hard
          experience in his kind, somewhat sad eyes.
          This fatherly man is HAKIM, a former political prisoner in
          Afghanistan and one of the CIA's most important assets.
          In the galley, a PRISONER is chained to a table. Hakim slides
          him The Photograph. The prisoner speaks in Arabic.

                         HAKIM

                         (TRANSLATING)
          He says he looks like Abu Ahmed.

                         MAYA
          Who did he work for?
          Hakim translates. Then the prisoner speaks.

                         HAKIM

                         (TRANSLATING)
          It was mostly with Abu Faraj - they
          were always together.

                         MAYA
          What did he do for Faraj?

                         HAKIM

                         (TRANSLATING)
          He carried messages from Faraj to
          bin Laden and from bin Laden back to
          Faraj.
          Maya leans into Hakim -

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         MAYA
          We need to ask him something to see
          if he's telling the truth. We don't
          know if he really knew Faraj.
          Hakim speaks to the prisoner.

                         HAKIM
          He just told me the names of all of
          Faraj's children. I think he's
          telling the truth.

          Maya is pitching Bradley in his office. Bradley sits with
          his feet up on his desk, holding The Photograph.
          Daniel is slouched on the couch in back.
          Jessica is perched on the arm of the couch, bare legs crossed.

          Maya stands.

                         MAYA
          Twenty detainees recognize that photo
          of Abu Ahmed. They say he's part of
          the inner circle of guys who were
          hanging out in Afghanistan pre-9/11.

                         (BEAT)
          A lot of them say that after 9/11,
          he went to work for KSM.

                         (BEAT)
          When KSM got captured, he went to
          work for Abu Faraj, primarily as a
          courier from Faraj to bin Laden.

                         BRADLEY
          Well, that's good. You still-

                         MAYA
          Yeah, we don't know if Abu is on the
          outside of the network - part of a
          series of cutouts and dead drops -
          or if he has a direct connection to
          bin Laden. Does bin Laden invite
          him into the living room and hand
          him a letter directly? Or is Abu
          just the last guy in a long line of
          couriers, so that's why everybody
          knows him?

                         BRADLEY
          That's not all you don't know. You
          don't have his true name, and you
          don't have a clue of where he is.

                         MAYA
          We know that he's important. The
          fact that everybody's heard of Abu
          Ahmed but nobody will tell me where
          he is suggests that.

                         BRADLEY
          Maybe. Detainees could withhold his
          location for any number of reasons.
          Perhaps they don't know; perhaps
          this Abu is just a cover story and
          he's really a fucking unicorn. The
          withholding doesn't reveal what you
          want it to - does it?

                         MAYA
          No.

                         BRADLEY
          And if you did find him, you don't
          know that he'd be with bin Laden.

                         DANIEL
          We don't know what we don't know.

          mean?

                         DANIEL
          It's a tautology.

          Listen, not one single detainee has
          said that he's located with the big
          guy, just that he delivers messages.
          Am I wrong?

          No.

          You're thinking of Abu Khalid.

          Who?

                         FARAJ
          Al Buluchi. My courier for the
          Sheikh.

                         MAYA
          Okay, so you're telling me that all
          the other brothers are wrong, and
          there's some famous Buluchi guy that
          is working for you and bin Laden
          that I've never even heard of?

                         FARAJ
          Why should you have heard of him?

                         MAYA
          What does this Buluchi guy look like?

                         FARAJ
          Tall, long white beard, thin. He
          uses a cane.

                         MAYA
          Kind of like Gandolf?

                         FARAJ
          Who?

                         MAYA
          When was the last time you saw him?

                         FARAJ
          A month ago, in Karachi, but I don't
          know where he is now. Sometimes I
          wouldn't even see him, he would just
          tell me where to leave the messages.

                         MAYA
          I don't believe you.
          The GUARD in the room with them leans forward and SLAPS Faraj
          across the face.
          Faraj's expression doesn't change and Maya herself remains
          flat and steady, unmoved by the violence.
          She's not quite the same young lady she was a few years ago.

          You're not being fulsome in your
          replies.

                         FARAJ
          You can't force me to tell you
          something I don't know.

                         MAYA
          You do realize this is not a normal
          prison. You determine how you are
          treated, and your life will be very
          uncomfortable until you give me
          information I need.
          The guard slaps Faraj again. Faraj is impassive.

          Maya walks around the facility, quiet at this hour, and finds
          another insomniac, Daniel, by the monkey cage. The cage is
          empty.

                         MAYA
          Faraj is completely denying knowing
          Abu Ahmed, and that's using every
          measure we have.

                         DANIEL
          He's either going to withhold or die
          from the pressure you're putting on
          him.

                         MAYA
          Do you want to take a run at him?

                         DANIEL
          No.

          No? Since when?

          You know, I've been meaning to tell
          you: I'm getting outta here.

                         MAYA
          What? You okay?

                         DANIEL
          I'm fine. I've just seen too many
          guys naked. It's gotta be over a
          hundred at this point. I need to go
          do something normal for awhile.

                         MAYA
          Like what?

                         DANIEL
          Go to Washington, do the dance, see
          how that environment works.

                         (BEAT)
          You should come with me. Be my number

          Maya looks at Dan. No longer the man he once was. She
          doesn't hide her disappointment.

                         MAYA
          I'm not going to find Abu Ahmed from

          D.C.
          They both look at the empty cage, clocking the irony.

                         DANIEL
          They killed my monkeys.
          Something about an escape. Can you
          fucking believe that?

                         MAYA
          Sorry, Dan.

                         DANIEL
          Look, Maya, you gotta be really
          careful with detainees now. The
          politics are changing and you don't
          want to be the last one holding a
          dog collar when the oversight
          committee comes.

          The car pulls up to a checkpoint manned by PAKISTANI POLICE.
          The Policeman look at the car - look at the plate - the plate
          is diplomatic - they walk around the car and stop at the
          window - shine their bright light right into Maya's eyes.
          A POLICEMAN motions for her to roll down her window.

          Where are you going?

          seat.

          It's a gym bag.
          Maya does not get out of the car. She stares at him
          defiantly. He advances forward a bit. She rolls up her
          window, flicks the door lock, and starts dialing her cell
          phone.
          The policeman walks away to rejoin his group. The police
          confer. The original policeman returns, this time with
          several other cops. They knock on the glass. Hard.
          Maya stares straight ahead.

          Look, I know Abu Ahmed is your baby,

          No, it's not.

                         JESSICA
          So Faraj went south on you - it
          happens. There are still cells in
          London and Spain planning the next
          round of attacks.

                         MAYA
          I can work on it at the same time -
          plus I think it's a good thing that
          he lied.

                         JESSICA
          No, not at the expense of protecting
          the homeland, you can't. Wait a
          minute, why is it a good thing?

                         MAYA
          You sound just like Bradley. He
          doesn't believe in my lead either.

                         (BEAT)
          It's a good thing because the fact
          that Faraj withheld on Abu Ahmed is
          revealing. The only other thing he
          lied about was the location of bin
          Laden himself. That means Faraj
          thinks Abu Ahmed in as important to
          protect as bin Laden. That confirms
          my lead.

                         JESSICA
          Or it's confirmation bias.

                         (BEAT)

          okay? Is that okay to say?

          Possibly. But Al Qaeda needs doctors
          and they are short staffed and that
          could explain his rise. In six months
          to a year, if he doesn't fuck up, he
          could be called in to treat bin Laden.
          And at that moment, with 25 mil on
          the table, I think he gives up the
          Big Man. And if he doesn't, we kill

          The office has grown bigger and busier and the cubicle maze
          is filled with many new faces of young agents excited to be
          in Pakistan.
          Sitting alone at her desk we find Maya just as she's finishing
          a report. She gets up, crosses the room and goes to the
          desk of a young woman who reminds us in her idealistic
          enthusiasm of the way Maya was six years ago. This is DEBBIE.

                         DEBBIE
          Hi. I painstakingly combed through
          everything in the system and found
          this.

          She hands Maya a file.

                         DEBBIE (CONT'D)
          It's him. He was one of ten names
          on a watch list sent to us by the
          Moroccans after 9/11: Ibrahim Sayeed.
          They told us to watch out for him,
          apparently they think his whole family
          and extended family is bad and has
          ties to KSM.

                         (BEAT)
          He was picked up for fake papers and
          a doctored exit visa leaving
          Afghanistan, traveling through Morocco
          en route to Kuwait. Abu Ahmed al-
          Kuwaiti. This must be Abu Ahmed.

                         MAYA
          Doesn't matter, but I wish I had
          that five years ago. How come I
          never saw it before?

                         DEBBIE
          Nobody saw it, most likely. There
          was a lot of white noise after 9/11,
          countries wanting to help out, we
          got millions of tips and...

          Human error.
          Maya turns her attention back to the WHITE BOARD and as Debbie
          keeps talking we follow Maya's gaze across the row of MUG
          SHOTS of Al Qaeda personnel. While a few of the men are
          African or are distinctive looking for other reasons, most
          of them look fairly similar in that they're all wearing the
          same type of clothes and have the same trademark long gnarly
          beards.

                         DEBBIE (CONT'D)

                         (PRESSING ON)
          Anyway I thought you should know
          about it.

                         (PLUS)
          I just want to say I've heard a lot
          about you. You inspired me to come
          to Pakistan.
          Maya's eyes narrow. She keeps looking at the WHITE BOARD

                         DEBBIE (CONT'D)
          Maybe you'll let me buy you a kabob
          sometime?

          He was in the files this whole time.
          The family name is Sayeed.

                         DANIEL
          Ok, but he's dead. So doesn't that
          make him a little less interesting
          to you?

          MAYA O.S.
          He may not be. We now know that Abu
          Ahmed is one of eight brothers. All
          the brothers in the family look alike.
          Three of them went to Afghanistan.
          Isn't it possible that when the three
          eldest brothers grew beards in
          Afghanistan, they started to look
          alike? I think the one calling
          himself Abu Ahmed is still alive.
          The picture we've been using is wrong.
          It's of his older brother, Habeeb.
          He's the one that's is dead.

                         MAYA (CONT'D)
          We just have a detainee who buried
          somebody who looked like Abu Ahmed.
          But if somebody as important as Abu
          Ahmed had died, they'd be talking
          about it online in chat rooms all
          over the place. Plus, the detainee
          said that Habeeb died in 2001. We
          know that Abu Ahmed was alive then,
          trying to get into Tora Bora with
          Ammar. That means it's probably one
          of the other brothers that's dead.

          DANIEL O.S.
          In other words, you want it to be
          true.

          him like a shark from the other end of the hallway: Maya.
          Bradley looks determined not to deal with her right now, and
          lowers his head, but she spreads her arms slightly and
          basically blocks his passage through the hallway

          This guy never met bin Laden.
          This guy is a free lancer working
          off the fucking internet. No one
          has even talked to bin Laden in four

          you're doing? You're chasing a ghost
          while the whole fucking network grows
          all around you!
          For a moment she is silenced by Bradley's reprimand but then

          she recklessly goes at him:

          you got a real terrorist. But the
          truth is you don't understand
          Pakistan, and you don't know Al Qaeda.
          Either give me the team I need to
          follow this lead, or the other thing
          you're gonna have on your resume is
          being the first Station Chief to be
          called before a congressional
          committee for subverting the efforts
          to capture or kill bin Laden.

          You're fucking out of your mind.

          I need four techs in a safe house in

          How do you know the gender?

          (points on screen, to
          a thin line)
          This is a clothes-line here, for
          laundry. Men don't mess with the
          wash.
          We watch that shape move away from the clothes-line and back
          to the house.

                         STEVE (CONT'D)
          It takes her about four seconds to
          move from there to the front door.
          So she's on the older side.

                         MAYA
          What's that up there?

                         STEVE
          Those are kids. They're shuffling
          around, sword-fighting or something
          with sticks.

                         (POINTING AGAIN)
          You can see their height relative to
          this - these are cows - so they're
          probably between seven and nine.
          Boys.
          Another FIGURE comes out of the house and moves to the clothes-
          line and grabs some laundry.

          Your female is moving fast.

                         STEVE
          That's what I wanted to show you.
          (to the Imagery

                         TECHNICIAN)
          Can we pause this please?

                         (TO MAYA)
          That's not the same lady. That's
          female #3.

                         MAYA
          So you found two males, three females?

                         STEVE
          That's correct.
          Maya suddenly gets it.

                         MAYA
          You're missing a male.

                         STEVE
          Yes we are.

          INT. WHITE HOUSE - NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL S.C.I.F. -


                         CONTINUOUS
          George is on one side of a conference table, on the other
          side is the DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, THE SPECIAL
          ASSISTANT TO THE DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR, and the

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR.

                         GEORGE
          If there are three females, there
          ought to be three males. Observant
          Muslim women either live with parents
          or with their husbands. We think
          there's a third family living in the
          house.

          SUPERIMPOSE: SITUATION ROOM - THE WHITE HOUSE

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          So this third male that you've
          identified as possibly being bin
          Laden, do I just give up all hope of
          ever seeing a photograph of him?

                         GEORGE
          Hope? Hope is not a targeting layer.
          You give up your hope right now. We
          scanned for heat signatures, but we
          can't validate if it's a man or a
          woman up there. We found a safe
          house, but we can't get a vantage
          point to fire a telescope over the
          balcony wall.

          EXT. COMPOUND - ABBOTTABAD - MORNING

          A DOCTOR comes to the compound offering immunizations. One
          of the women let's him in, and he offers polio vaccines to
          the children.

                         GEORGE
          We talked about burrowing a pin hole
          camera but there's a high risk of
          discovery.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
          We have explored the possibility of
          digging tunnels, of sending hot air
          balloons, of re-routing supply C-
          130's to take a peek, but that might
          be too alerting. We've looked for
          ways of collecting available DNA
          from his trash - you know, looking
          for his toothbrush, but they burn
          the trash. We started a vaccination
          program, we sent a doctor to the
          house, to see if he could pull blood.
          A lady in a black burkha rushes out and angrily shoos the
          doctor away.

                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
          That didn't work out. We thought
          about sending a guy with a bucket to
          pull a sample from the sewer to
          analyze his fecal matter.

          SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR
          What was wrong with that, exactly?
          He looks up.

                         GEORGE
          What was wrong with that? The sample
          would be too diluted.

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          And it's asking too much to get a
          voice confirmation with him on the
          phone?

                         GEORGE
          They don't make telephone calls from
          the compound. We pulled the cell
          tower nearby.

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          And I'm also going to give up hope
          that he might ever get in that white
          SUV and drive around a bit and we
          could see him? Don't they get
          groceries.

                         GEORGE
          The unidentified third male does not
          get groceries. He does not leave
          the compound. He does not present
          himself for photographs.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
          When he needs fresh air, he paces
          around beneath a grape arbor, but
          the leaves are so thick they obscure
          our satellite views. This is a
          professional attempt to avoid
          detection - real tradecraft. The
          only people we've seen behave this
          way are other top level Al Qaeda
          operatives.
          The National Security Advisor nods to his Special Assistant
          who slides a big folder across his desk to George.

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          We did a Red Team on your analysis.
          According to them, this behavior
          could belong to someone other than
          Al Qaeda.

          DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          They did give a forty percent chance
          that the unidentified third man is a
          senior Al Qaeda operative. But they
          also said there's a thirty-five
          percent chance he's a Saudi drug

                         DEALER
          (reading from the

                         BINDER)
          A fifteen percent chance that he's a
          Kuwaiti arms smuggler, a ten percent
          chance that he's one of the relatives
          of the brothers.

          SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR
          Basically, we agree with you, the
          house screams security, it screams
          someone who wants privacy, it even
          screams 'bad guy', but it does not
          scream bin Laden.

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          You get the point.

                         (BEAT)
          If you can't prove it's bin Laden,
          at least prove it's not somebody
          else, like a drug dealer.
          Beat.
          The meeting is adjourned.
          As they walk out --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         GEORGE
          You know we lost our ability to prove
          that when we lost the detainee
          program.

                         (BEAT)
          Who the hell am I supposed to ask?
          Some guy in Gitmo who is all lawyered
          up? He'll just tell his lawyer to
          warn bin Laden.

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          You'll think of something.

          He'd be the first successful drug
          dealer never to have dealt drugs.
          He has no internet access to the
          house. He makes no phone calls either
          in or out. Who's he selling to,
          who's he buying from, how's he making
          his money? And if you're going to
          say he's retired, I'd say where's
          his swimming pool, where's the gold
          cage with the falcons? And why does
          he send his courier to the two cities
          in Pakistan we most associate with
          Al Qaeda, that have nothing
          particularly to do with heroin
          production?

                         GEORGE
          I have to admit, I just don't get
          the rhythms of politics.

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          You think this is political? If
          this was political we'd be having
          this conversation in October when
          there's an election bump. This is
          pure risk. Based on deductive
          reasoning, inference, supposition
          and the only human reporting you
          have is six years old, from detainees
          who are questioned under duress.
          The political move here is to tell
          you to go fuck yourself, and remind
          you that I was in the room when your
          old boss pitched WMD Iraq...at least
          there you guys brought photographs.

                         GEORGE
          You know, you're right, I agree with
          everything you just said. What I
          meant was, a man in your position,
          how do you evaluate the risk of not
          doing something, the risk of
          potentially letting bin Laden slip
          through your fingers?
          George shakes his head with an "aww shucks" kind of shake.

                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
          That is a fascinating question.
          George walks away. After a beat, the National Security
          advisor calls after him.

          NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
          Hey.
          George turns around. The National Security Advisor approaches

          (lowering his voice)
          I'm not saying we're gonna do it.
          But the President wants to know: if
          we were going to act, how would we
          do it? Give us options.

          I actually tried to kill this program
          a couple of times. They've gone
          through an initial round of testing,
          and they have excellent radar defeat -
          we just haven't tested them with

          There are two narratives about the

          This registers on the SEALs.

                         MAYA (CONT'D)
          The one that you're most familiar
          with is that UBL is hiding in a cave
          in the Tribal Areas, that he's
          surrounded by a large contingent of

          But that narrative is pre- 9/11
          understanding of UBL.
          The second narrative is that he's
          living in a city - living in a city
          with multiple points of egress and
          entries and with access to
          communications so that he can keep
          in touch with the organization. You

          We've located an individual we believe
          based on detainee reporting is bin
          Laden's courier. He's living in a

          Bin Laden uses a courier to interact
          with the outside world. By locating
          the courier, we've located bin Laden.

          Quite frankly, I didn't even want to
          use you guys, with your dip and your
          velcro and all your gear bullshit.
          I wanted to drop a bomb but people
          didn't believe in this lead enough
          to drop a bomb, so they're using you
          guys as canaries on the theory that
          if bin Laden isn't there, you can
          sneak away and no one will be the
          wiser.

                         (BEAT)

          She angrily wipes the number 128 off the window and changes
          it to 129.

          people we don't know. At the far end of the table are back
          benchers, including Maya.

                         CIA DIRECTOR
          I'm about to go look the President
          in the eye and what I'd like to know,
          no fucking bullshit, is where everyone
          stands on this thing. Now, very
          simply. Is he there or is he not
          fucking there?
          He looks to the Deputy Director.

                         DEPUTY DIRECTOR
          We all come at this through the filter
          of our own past experiences. I
          remember Iraq WMD very clearly, I
          fronted that and I can tell you the
          case for that was much stronger than
          this case.

          Yes or no.

                         DEPUTY DIRECTOR
          We don't deal in certainty, we deal
          in probability. I'd say there's a
          sixty percent probability he's there.
          The CIA Director points to Wolf.

                         WOLF
          I concur. Sixty percent.

                         GEORGE
          I'm at eighty percent. Their OPSEC
          is what convinces me.

                         CIA DIRECTOR
          You guys ever agree on anything?

                         DANIEL
          Well, I agree with sixty, we're basing
          this mostly on detainee reporting
          and I spent a bunch of time in those
          rooms - who knows?
          Maya shoots Daniel a look. What a traitor.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          I'd say it's a soft sixty, sir. I'm
          virtually certain there's some high
          value target there, I'm just not
          sure it's bin Laden.
          The CIA Director leans back in his chair.

                         CIA DIRECTOR
          This is a cluster-fuck, isn't it?

                         JEREMY
          I'd like to know what Maya thinks.

                         DEPUTY DIRECTOR
          We're all incorporating her assessment
          into ours.
          Maya can't take it anymore:

                         MAYA
          One hundred percent, he's there -
          okay, fine, ninety-five percent

          Inside the dim interior, illuminated by only blinking
          instrumentation, the men are tense, quiet.
          We pass slowly from face to face, noting each SEAL's
          contemplation of the mission that lies ahead.
          Some of them are anonymous soldiers. Many we've come to
          know: Justin, joyfully bobbing his head, grooving to his
          iPod... Saber's eyes fixed on a thousand-yard stare... Hakim
          struggles to get comfortable and control his anxiety, wipes
          away sweat... Patrick checks his gear for the hundredth time.

          Small cottages mixed in with larger suburban homes. Among
          them, swimming pools. The water shimmering. Surreal. Then:
          rows of green fields. A stand of trees.
          It appears: AC 1. It is massive - six or seven times larger
          than any other nearby structure - with sixteen foot high
          walls and a gated interior. A fortress.

          PRINCE 51 has crash landed into a precarious position, with
          the back half of the helicopter wedged into the top of the

          Patrick, Justin and SIX other SEALs cluster near the First
          Gate in the animal pen. One of the SEALs places a charge on
          the gate, while others check the Prayer Room.
          Boom! The charge partially blows open the metal swing doors
          of the gate, leaving a very narrow gap. Not ideal. The
          SEALs muscle and squeeze their way through the narrow opening
          in the jagged metal as the SNIPER climbs up on the roof of
          the prayer room.

          EXT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT

          Patrick and Jared arrive at the guest house but can't see
          inside - the windows and doors are covered with sheets.
          Patrick kneels down to place a charge at the front door handle
          when the door erupts with gunfire
          - Bullets fly out of the wooden door. One skims Patrick's
          shoulder as he kneels lower. Patrick fires back at the house,
          putting a dozen rounds inside.
          A moment passes. They wait for a response. The door handle
          unlocks. ABU AHMED'S WIFE appears at the doorway and walks
          out.

          The Commanding Officer opens the gate and the other SEALs
          walk inside. As a group, they move towards the main house,
          arriving at the South side front door. The door is open and
          they enter -

          INT. MAIN HOUSE FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

          Piercing the first floor darkness with their infra red lights,
          the SEALs advance slowly into the first floor hallway.
          Piles of household clutter, stacked high in bizarre shapes,
          greet them like the innards of a haunted house. One of the
          SEAL's catches movement: A figure with an AK-47 scrambling
          through clutter, then disappearing around a corner.

                         JUSTIN
          Abrar!
          The figure, Abu Ahmed's brother, ABRAR, re-appears at the
          end of the hallway. He pokes his head out -

          her body.
          - Justin shoots her. She falls...Abrar is underneath her -
          he is still breathing, gasping and
          - Justin shoots him again, silencing him
          - Then looks to his wife and assesses her condition
          - Badly wounded, faint breathing, life fading from her eyes...
          - Justin turns away

          Justin and a BREACHER proceed down the hall to the heavy
          gate that blocks access to the stairway while another SEAL
          stays behind. Somewhere, children are screaming.

                         JUSTIN
          Shut those fucking kids up.
          O.S. the kids quiet down.

          In the regrouping that occurs on the side of the main house,

          Saber waits with his carbine raised. Anxiety crosses his

          Khaled hears his name being called from below. A few feet
          away from him in the dimly lit hall is a loaded AK-47. He
          goes to the gun and picks it up.
          He hears his name again, "Khaled!" And the voice sounds
          friendly, urgent.
          Perhaps thinking that he can surrender peacefully, Khaled
          puts the gun down, resting it against a wall, and turns and
          heads back to the sound of his name.
          Saber sees Khaled poke his head around the corner of the
          stairway and fires - killing him instantly.
          Saber pushes past the body, Patrick following, and they climb
