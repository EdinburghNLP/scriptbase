Sissy Hankshaw is born with enormous thumbs that help her hitchhiking through the US from a young age.
She becomes a model in advertising and her NY agent 'the Countess' sends her to his ranch in CA to shoot a commercial, set against the background of mating whooping cranes.
There, she befriends Bonanza Jellybean, one of the cowgirls at the beauty- ranch.
The cowgirls take command of the ranch from the Countess and 'drug' the cranes with 'peyote'.
The police besiege the ranch.
