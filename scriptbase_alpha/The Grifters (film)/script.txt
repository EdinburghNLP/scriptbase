                         GRIFTERS
                    by Donald E. Westlake

                  Based on the novel by Jim Thompson. 

                                   Second Draft.      
                                   March 1989
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

     FADE IN:
     
     EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
     
     AN ANGLE establishing the race track, Ruidoso Downs
     (pronounced Ree-oh-do-so), set among the beautiful mountains
     of New Mexico's Lincoln National Forest, as a white Chrysler
     turns in with a stream of cars moving toward the parking
     area.
     
     AN ANGLE through the open driver-side window of the Chrysler
     at LILLY DILLON, 39 but looking younger, beautiful but cold
     and watchful.
     
     WIDE SHOT, track in b.g. as Lilly parks the Chrysler, gets
     out, locks the car. As she walks toward the track, WIPE
     RIGHT, as SCENE TWO WIPES IN from the left. SCENE ONE CAMERA
     FOLLOWS Lilly as she walks across the large parking area.
     SPLIT SCREEN.
     
     SCENE TWO:
     
     EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY
     
     Downtown Los Angeles, near the courts and the business
     section. ROY DILLON, 25, handsome and charming but self
     indulgent, parks his orange Honda convertible, gets out,
     picks up a large ledger book from the back seat, goes around
     to open the trunk.
     
     AN ANGLE on the trunk, establishing the tools of the
     salesman's trade: catalogs, samples, ledgers full of manuals
     and product sheets. Roy adds the ledger from the back seat,
     shuts the trunk, walks away.
     
     EXT. 6TH STREET - DAY
     
     Roy walks around the corner near a bar/restaurant. As he
     approaches it, WIPE LEFT, the two half-width scenes
     contracting to one-third each as SCENE THREE WIPES IN from
     the right.
     
     SCENE ONE: Lilly approaches the track's entrance doors.
     
     SCENE TWO: Roy approaches the bar.
     
     SCENE THREE:
     
     EXT. SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD - DAY
     
     A baby blue Cadillac parks in front of a jeweler.
     
     AN ANGLE on the driver's door as MYRA LANGTRY, 36, beautiful
     in an impersonal calculating way, gets out, carrying a small
     jewelry care, and locks the car. At first glance, Myra looks
     rather like Lilly. (Myra always wears large dangly earrings,
     and usually wears big-lensed dark sunglasses.)
     
     SIMULTANEOUSLY:
     
     SCENE ONE: Lilly enters the track.
     
     SCENE TWO: Roy enters the bar.
     
     SCENE THREE: Myra enters the jeweler's.
     
     WIPE RIGHT AND LEFT, as SCENE TWO takes FULL SCREEN.
     
     INT. BAR - DAY
     
     AN ANGLE on a hurried bartender in a full bar, crowded with a
     NOISY lunchtime crowd. In b.g., Roy slithers his way to the
     bar, waving a bill in the air to attract the bartender's
     attention.
     
     AN ANGLE on Roy as the bartender comes to him. Roy puts the
     bill on the bar, holding it down with one finger, as he
     SHOUTS his order. The bartender looks down.
     
     BARTENDER'S POV: Roy's finger holds down a twenty dollar
     bill.
     
     AN ANGLE steep over Roy's shoulder, the twenty visible, as
     the bartender hurries away to get the drink. Roy's hand makes
     a fist, swallowing the twenty, opens, pushing a ten out onto
     the bar, holding it there with one finger.
     
     AN ANGLE on the bartender returning with a draft beer,
     nodding to other ORDERS shouted to him along the way, putting
     the beer down, grabbing the bill without looking at it,
     hurrying away.
     
     AN ANGLE on Roy, content, smiling, sipping his beer.
     
     AN ANGLE on the bartender, hurrying by, slapping Roy's change
     down, moving on, Roy nodding acknowledgement, reaching out.
     
     CU, the change, a ten dollar bill on top. Roy's hand closes
     over it.
     
     EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
     
     WIDE SHOT, the tote board at the track, showing the shifting
     odds on the horses for the next race, the amounts bet.
     
     CLOSE SHOT, number 3. Not much bet, odds 70-1.
     
     EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
     
     AN ANGLE on Lilly, frowning at the tote board. She carries a
     large heavy shoulder-bag, which she opens, looking in it as
     though it were a file drawer.
     
     AN ANGLE on Lilly studying the contents of her bag, the track
     beyond her, the mountains visible out beyond the track wall.
     Lilly moves.
     
     AN ANGLE on a high-dollar betting window, as Lilly
     approaches, taking bank-banded wads of bills from her bag.
     
     EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
     
     A change of numbers sweeps across the board.
     
     EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
     
     Lilly moves away from the betting window, tucking betting
     tickets into her bag.
     
     ECU, Lilly's bag, compartmented, with stacks of money, small
     envelopes and notes on notepaper in each compartment. Lilly
     carefully files the betting slips.
     
     AN ANGLE on Lilly looking out at the tote board.
     
     EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
     
     CU, number 3. Odds 32-1.
     
     EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
     
     AN ANGLE on Lilly, not satisfied. She turns and goes back.
     
     AN ANGLE at the betting window as Lilly arrives and makes
     more bets.
     
     EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
     
     CU, number 3. Odds 32-1. CROWD NOISE INCREASES. The numbers
     shift: odds 26-1.
     
                         CALLER (O.S.)
               And they're off!
     
     INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
     
     Very quiet, stately; abrupt contrast with the track. A slow
     ticking clock.
     Myra sits in the client's chair, while at the desk sits the
     JEWELER, a pleasant but overweight man of 40, who studies a
     jeweled bracelet through a loupe. He sighs, drops the loupe,
     shakes his head regretfully.
     
                         JEWELER
               Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
     
                         MYRA
               Why? What's wrong?
     
                         JEWELER
                   (personal emotion mixed
                    in)
               You are a valued customer, as you
               know.
     
                         MYRA
               But what's wrong?
     
                         JEWELER
               I can't understand a thing like
               this. It's something you almost
               never see.
     
                         MYRA
               What is?
     
                         JEWELER
                   (holding up bracelet)
               This is some of the finest
               filigreed platinum I've ever seen.
               But the stones, no. They're not
               diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
     
                         MYRA
               But they must be! They cut glass!
     
                         JEWELER
                   (wry)
               Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry.
               Do you know where it was purchased?
     
     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
     
     An expensive hotel room, with a sunstruck day beyond the
     windows. Myra, naked, a few years younger, sits cross-legged
     on the bed and laughs at COLE "FARMER" LANGLEY, 55, stringy
     bodied, who stands naked, his back to us, hands on hips,
     presenting himself to Myra. She reaches forward, hand hidden
     by his body as she lifts something that was hanging on
     something at the front of him. She brings back the bracelet,
     looks at it, is delighted, puts it on, and then leans forward
     again toward the unmoving Cole, her head hidden by his body.
     
     INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
     
                         MYRA
               It was a gift. It isn't worth
               anything at all?
     
                         JEWELER
                   (warm, encouraging)
               Why, of course it is. I can offer
               you -- well, five hundred dollars.
     
     Myra expected -- and needed -- a lot more. She's worried,
     tense, but stuck. She nods.
     
                         MYRA
               All right.
     
                         JEWELER
                   (rising)
               I'll get you a check.
     
     He leaves the room. Myra grimaces, in almost physical pain.
     
     INT. SECOND BAR - DAY
     
     Another crowded lunchtime bar. A big beefy BARTENDER moves
     quickly, carrying a draft beer.
     
     AN ANGLE on Roy, in position, finger holding bill down, as
     the bartender arrives, puts down the beer, reaches for the
     bill, stops, stares at the bill.
     
     TWO SHOT, the bartender and Roy, as the bartender gives Roy a
     very cold look. He knows, and Roy knows he knows. Roy tries
     an innocent smile, which doesn't work. Roy moves.
     
     CU, the ten dollar bill, as Roy grabs it, but the bartender
     simultaneously grabs Roy's wrist.
     
     AN ANGLE on Roy and the bartender as Roy tries to pull away
     and the bartender holds him with his left hand while reaching
     under the bar with his right. He comes up with a sawed-off
     baseball bat. Roy, seeing it, throws his free arm up to
     protect his head, but the bartender pushes the blunt end of
     the bat straight across the bar at a downward angle and hard
     into Roy's solar plexus, driving the air out of him and
     propelling him back away from the bar, leaving the ten. The
     nearest CUSTOMERS on both sides become aware that something
     happened, but nothing follows and they're already involved in
     conversations. The bartender scoops up the ten as he puts the
     bat away under the bar.
     
     AN ANGLE on Roy, arms folded across his torso, staring in
     shock toward the bar, where the space he filled has already
     been closed in by other bodies. Nearly retching, he stumbles
     toward the door.
     
     EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
     
     AN ANGLE on four PEOPLE at a table, CHEERING a race,
     switching to disgust and despair when they lose, moving away
     from the table, leaving their betting tickets behind. Lilly
     passes by, smoothly and casually scoops up the tickets, moves
     on along a row of tables, and there finding more tickets.
     
     INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
     
     Myra sits as before. The jeweler enters with a check, which
     he hands her. She looks up at him, making no move to leave.
     
                         JEWELER
               I hope you're not too badly
               disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
     
                         MYRA
               It's not your fault.
     
                         JEWELER
               You'll give us an opportunity to
               serve you again, I hope. If there's
               anything you think we might be
               interested in...
     
                         MYRA
               I have only one thing now. Are you
               interested?
     
                         JEWELER
               Well, I'd have to see it, of
               course.
     
                         MYRA
               You are seeing it. You're looking
               right at it.
     
     The jeweler is puzzled, then startled.
     
                         JEWELER
               I see.
     
     He turns away, goes behind his desk, sits down, looks at
     Myra.
     
                         JEWELER
               You know something, Mrs. Langtry? A
               bracelet like that very rarely
               happens. A fine setting and
               workmanship usually mean precious
               stones. It always hurts me when I
               find they're not. I always hope -- 
                   (faint sad friendly smile)
               -- I'm mistaken.
     
     Myra likes him better now, even though he hasn't solved her
     problem. She rises.
     
                         MYRA
               Thank you. For everything you felt
               you could do.
     
     EXT. STREET - DAY
     
     Roy has been throwing up but is finished now. He's sprawled
     like a shot deer across the hood of his Honda, still
     clutching his stomach. A police car stops, the passenger COP
     gets out. He's suspicious at first.
     
                         COP
               Sir? Everything all right?
     
     The sight of the uniform forces Roy into gear. He
     straightens, smiling through his pain.
     
                         ROY
               Getting better. A bad shrimp, I
               think.
     
     The con's suspicion changes to concern.
     
                         COP
               Want us to take you to a doctor?
     
                         ROY
               No no, I'm fine now, thanks,
               anyway. Still got a lot of clients
               to see.
     
                         COP
               Take it easy, now.
     
                         ROY
               Oh, I will.
     
     EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
     
     Late afternoon. AN ANGLE on the parking area, where almost
     all the cars are gone and the few remaining are widely
     separated. The white Chrysler is one of these. Lilly walks to
     it from the track entrance.
     
     AN ANGLE on the Chrysler as Lilly opens the trunk, puts her
     bag inside.
     
     CLOSE UP, Lilly and the trunk. She takes betting tickets from
     her bag, sorts them, files them in envelopes in different
     compartments, puts some to one side, then sorts through these
     separated tickets, throwing some away, keeping some. She
     takes money from the bag, puts tickets in, closes the bag
     with the money on the trunk floor. Reaching farther in, she
     lifts the pad deep inside the trunk, lifts the metal floor
     panel, and reveals a cache mostly filled with money. She adds
     today's skim, puts everything away, puts the bag back on her
     shoulder, closes the trunk.
     
     EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - DAY
     
     A shabby apartment hotel on Wilshire. An exterior hall
     balcony on each floor has the entrance doors to the front
     apartments. Roy's Honda makes the turn and enters the
     basement garage.
     
     INT. MADERO LOBBY - DAY
     
     Modest but clean. The owner, SIMMS, a sloppy garrulous old
     bore, talks with a potential RENTER.
     
                         SIMMS
               Put it this way, now. Say I rent to
               a woman, well, she has to have a
               room with a bath. I insist on it,
               because otherwise she's got the
               hall bath tied up all the time,
               washing her goddamn hair and her
               clothes and everything she can
               think of.
     
     In b.g., Roy, still in pain, comes out of the elevator, waves
     to Simms, who waves back without pausing in his monologue,
     and crosses to the mailboxes.
     
                         SIMMS
               Now, your minimum for a room with
               bath is three hundred a month, just
               for a place to sleep and no cooking
               allowed.
               And just how many of these tootsies
               make that kind of money and have to
               eat in restaurants and buy clothes
               and --
     
     Roy, carrying his junk mail and pretending not to be in pain,
     crosses to Simms.
     
                         ROY
               Mr. Simms.
     
                         SIMMS
                   (fawning)
               Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a
               potential new neighbor, looking at--
     
                         ROY
                   (uninterested)
               Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
     
     Simms doesn't like Mrs. Langtry, but can't say so.
     
                         SIMMS
               I'll send her right up.
     
     Roy goes back to the elevator. Simms continues his monologue.
     
                         SIMMS
               I had my first hotel thirty-seven
               years ago in Wichita Falls, Texas,
               and that's where I began to learn
               about women. They just don't make
               the money, you see, not regular
               they don't, and there's only one
               way they can get it.
     
     Roy enters the elevator.
     
                         SIMMS
               Now, that Mr. Dillon there, that's
               the fine type of person I have in
               mind for here. Like yourself, I
               have no doubt. He's a salesman,
               regular as clockwork, has a suite
               here. Fine man. Now, about these
               women. At first, you know, they
               just go out and do it now and then,
               just enough to make ends meet. But
               pretty soon they got that bank open
               twenty-four hours a day, and then
               you've got trouble. Hookers and
               hotellin' just don't mix.
               You'd think the cops'd be too busy
               catching real criminals, not
               snooping around after working
               girls, but that's the way the gravy
               stains, as the saying is, and I
               don't fight it. An ounce of
               prevention is my motto.
     
     Myra enters from the front, looks across at Simms, points
     upward. Simms calls to her.
     
                         SIMMS
               Oh, yes, Mrs. Langtry, he's up
               there, he's expecting you.
     
     Myra crosses to the elevator. Simms speaks more softly.
     
                         SIMMS
               If you keep out the women in the
               first place, see, you keep out the
               hookers, and then you keep out the
               cops, and that's how you have a
               clean place.
     
     EXT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY
     
     AN ANGLE along the balcony, with Roy's apartment door in f.g.
     and Los Angeles in b.g. Myra crosses to the door, opens it
     with her key, enters.
     
     INT. BATHROOM - DAY
     
     A small crowded old-fashioned bathroom. Roy, shirt open and
     trousers pushed down almost to his crotch, looks in the
     mirror at purplish greenish bruises on his stomach. He
     touches his stomach, winces.
     
                         MYRA (O.S.)
               Roy?
     
     He looks at the door, then grins at his reflection.
     
                         ROY
               Your medicine is here.
     
     He leaves the bathroom.
     
     INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
     
     Hotel furniture, shabby and anonymous. On the walls,
     contrasting with everything else, are two crying-clown
     pictures on black velvet, mounted in big boxy frames. Myra
     stands in the middle of the room, and Roy enters, shirt and
     trousers still disarranged.
     
                         MYRA
                   (amused by clothing)
               Well, well. In a real hurry, are
               we?
     
                         ROY
               Always, for you, baby.
     
     He reaches for her, but she playfully holds him off.
     
                         MYRA
               You aren't taking me for granted,
               are you?
     
                         ROY
               Taking you for granite?
     
     He grins, as his fingertip prods her breast.
     
                         ROY
               That isn't granite. If that fell on
               me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
     
                         MYRA
                   (playing along)
               Are you sure?
     
                         ROY
                   (pulling her close)
               Let's find out.
     
     EXT. HIGHWAY PHONE BOOTH - DAY
     
     Lilly's white Chrysler is parked next to an open-air phone.
     Traffic whizzes by. Lilly talks on the phone, with pen and
     notebook at the ready. The racetrack is visible in the b.g.
     
                         LILLY
               I'm done here. Do I come back to
               Baltimore?
     
     INT. OFFICE - DAY
     
     It could be an expensive, if gaudy, lawyer's office.
     Baltimore harbor is visible past the windows. IRV, the
     accountant, sits at a desk covered -- but neatly covered --
     with ledgers, computer printouts, etc. He speaks on the
     phone.
     
                         IRV
               Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
     
     INTERCUT PHONE BOOTH AND OFFICE
     
                         LILLY
               Delmar? I never go out to
               California. That's a thousand miles
               from here.
     
                         IRV
               Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody
               to handle playback this time. Come
               on, Lilly, you don't argue with
               Bobo.
     
                         LILLY
                   (fatalistic)
               I know.
     
                         IRV
               Take two, three days. Call when you
               get there.
     
                         LILLY
               Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang
               gleez on the way.
     
     This is Lilly making the best of the situation. She listens a
     bit more, GRUNTS a farewell, hangs up, moves to her car.
     
     INT. BEDROOM - DAY
     
     Again, anonymous hotel furniture. Roy and Myra naked in bed,
     he on his back, she straddling him, both moving gently. He's
     half feeling pleasure, half unconscious.
     
                         MYRA
               Roy?
     
                         ROY
               Mm?
     
                         MYRA
               Look at me.
     
                         ROY
               Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
     
                         MYRA
               Roy? It this all we have?
     
                         ROY
               All? It ain't bad.
     
                         MYRA
               No more than this? 
     
     He tries to concentrate on her.
     
                         ROY
               What are you talking abut, Myra?
               Marriage?
     
                         MYRA
               I didn't say that. You aren't
               marriage material.
     
     He keeps watching her, ironic, hips moving. Looking for a
     distraction, she notices the bruise on his stomach.
     
                         MYRA
               What's that?
     
     She touches it; he flinches back, in real pain.
     
                         ROY
               Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do,
               throw me off my game?
     
                         MYRA
                   (laughing)
               No, baby. Come to Mama.
     
     She folds forward onto him. He puts his arms around her. They
     rock together slowly.
     
     EXT. MOTEL - DAY
     
     The same mountains in b.g. as at the track. Lilly carries two
     small bags from her motel room, puts them on the back seat of
     the Cadillac, gets behind the wheel, drives away.
     
     INT. BATHROOM - DAY
     
     Myra, dressed, primps at the mirror, surveys herself
     critically, is reasonably satisfied, leaves.
     
     INT. BEDROOM - DAY
     
     Roy lies supine on the bed, semi-conscious, half-covered by a
     sheet. Myra, casual, not noticing his condition, leans her
     head in through the doorway.
     
                         MYRA
               Wore you out, did I? It's a good
               woman you can't keep down, baby.
     
     He moves fitfully, CROAKS an attempt at speech.
     
                         MYRA
               Have a good sleep, baby. Call you
               tomorrow. 
     
     He sits up, trying to grin and be easy.
     
                         ROY
               Wait'll next year.
     
     AN ANGLE across Roy's profile, with open bedroom door beyond
     him. Through it, the living room and outer door can be seen.
     Myra crosses the living room, opens the door. Bright sunlight
     pours in, emphasizing the sweat on his face. She closes the
     door, and he gives up trying to smile. Gingerly, he touches
     his bruised stomach, winces.
     
                         ROY
               Damn that guy.
     
     He's going to get out of bed, but movement creates pain. He
     sits back against the headboard, looks around, reaches
     painfully to the bedside table drawer, takes a quarter from
     it, studies the quarter, feels it with fingertips, places it
     on the back of his left hand, slowly moves the soft pads of
     his right palm over it, then turns the quarter over and
     repeats. Then he takes the quarter in his right hand, flips
     it, slaps it down onto the back of his left hand, SPEAKS
     simultaneously with the hands coming together.
     
                         ROY
               Smack.
     
     He looks away, right hand moving minimally on left hand.
     
                         ROY
               Heads.
     
     He lifts the right hand, nods, then flips the coin again,
     looks away, moves the right hand slightly.
     
                         ROY
               Heads.
     
     Again he's right. Again he repeats.
     
                         ROY
               Tails.
     
     He's about to repeat when a wave of weakness comes over him.
     He sits back, gasping, but won't acknowledge the problem.
     He forces himself to flip the coin, misses catching it, finds
     it on the blanket, flips it again, slaps it onto the back of
     the other hand, looks away.
     
                         ROY
               Tails.
     
     Right again. He prepares to flip the coin, but then his hand
     sags onto the covers, his chin drops, his eyes glaze.
     
                         ROY
                   (whispered)
               How much can I bet?
     
     INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY
     
     The train runs through a forest, tree shadows making a light
     and-dark pattern. Roy, four or five years younger, sits with
     a three-core-monte gang, consisting of a DEALER, a spectacled
     SHILL beside him, Roy facing the dealer, a ROPER next to Roy.
     On a briefcase on the dealer's lap are three cards, face up:
     An ace and two deuces. Across the aisle, alone in the seats,
     sits MINTZ, a conman in his fifties, pretending not to watch,
     but watching with amusement.
     
                         DEALER
               That's between you two. I got
               nothing at stake here, I'm just
               dealing.
     
                         SHILL
               What if we both guess wrong? You
               aren't gonna take...
     
     The dealer turns aside, allowing himself to be distracted. He
     and the shill ARGUE nonsensically. The roper nudges Roy, then
     reaches out and crimps the ace. Roy's doing a wide-eyed
     bumpkin kid; he stares at the roper in delight and amazement.
     
     AN ANGLE on the shill, arguing with the dealer but looking
     toward Roy and the roper, then increasing the force of his
     argument.
     
     AN ANGLE across the amused Mintz at the roper whispering to
     Roy.
     
     TWO SHOT, Roy and the roper.
     
                         ROPER
               We got him now! Put down that big
               bill you got.
     
                         ROY
                   (whispered)
               The fifty or the hundred?
     
                         ROPER
               The hundred! Hurry!
     
                         ROY
                   (doubtful)
               The ace is what I want?
     
     The roper's having trouble keeping his patience.
     
                         ROPER
               Sure it is!
     
     TWO SHOT, the dealer and the shill, fake-squabbling, Roy and
     the roper seen in b.g. between their faces, Roy finally
     bringing out his wallet, withdrawing a bill. Relieved, the
     dealer and the shill cut the crap.
     
     AN ANGLE on the group as Roy puts his hundred dollar bill on
     the briefcase.
     
                         ROY
               Is that okay?
     
     The shill pulls a messy wad of bills from his inner pocket,
     uses most of it to cover the bet.
     
                         SHILL
               You're damn right that's okay.
     
                         DEALER
                   (picks up the cards)
               Whoever finds the ace, wins.
     
     ECU, the dealer's hands, shuffling the cards at lightning
     speed. He deals the cards out face down.
     
     INT. BEDROOM - DAY
     
     CU, Roy's sweat-covered face, eyelids fluttering.
     
                         ROY
                   (whispered)
               Dark in here.
     
     INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY
     
     AN ANGLE on the group. Roy squints at the cards, light and
     dark playing on his face.
     
                         ROY
               Too dark. I just can't see.
     
     Casually, but too quickly to be stopped, he reaches across
     and plucks the shill's glasses off.
     
                         ROY
               Let me borrow these, will you?
     
     AN ANGLE across Mintz, surprised and amused, at the group in
     b.g., in consternation as Roy puts on the glasses and looks
     down at the cards.
     
                         ROY
               Now, that's better.
     
     ROY'S POV: The glasses are 'readers.' Through them, a large
     gray 'A' can be seen on the back of one of the non-crimped
     cards. Roy's hand reaches out and flips it over. It's the ace
     of spades.
     
     INT. BEDROOM - DAY
     
     AN ANGLE across Roy toward the doorway. Roy, eyes closed,
     smiles in triumph, then winces in pain. Mintz partially
     appears, hovering beside the bed, grinning at Roy.
     
                         MINTZ
               I didn't teach you that.
     
                         ROY
                   (whispered)
               You taught me a lot. Then I
               invented.
     
     INT. AIRPORT DEPARTURE LOUNGE - DAY
     
     Weary bored people sit around waiting. Roy, 17, lugging a big
     suitcase, walks through, takes a seat near Mintz, who's doing
     card tricks for his own pleasure. Roy watches, then moves
     closer.
     
                         ROY
               Let me see how you did that one.
     
                         MINTZ
               Scram. Go home.
     
                         ROY
               I can't. I just left home.
     
                         MINTZ
               You're too young. You should be in
               school.
     
                         ROY
               I am in school.
     
     Mintz peers at him, taking an interest. Then he holds up the
     five of spades, shows it to Roy, puts it back in the deck,
     shuffles, shows Roy the deck.
     
                         MINTZ
               Where's the five?
     
                         ROY
               In your other hand.
     
     Mintz grins slowly, turns his hand over with the palmed card
     showing.
     
     INT. BEDROOM NIGHT
     
     Roy slumps, eyes closed, half-smiling, with the fever Mintz
     hovering. Roy's smile fades, his fluttering eyelids grow
     still, his face slack. The fever Mintz fades and disappears.
     
     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
     
     AN ANGLE on a large sign indicating "Los Angeles" straight
     ahead. CAMERA PANS DOWN and around 180 degrees to face the
     several lanes of heavy Los Angeles-bound traffic. LONG BEAT.
     Hundreds of cars rush by. CAMERA PANS with Lilly's white
     Chrysler as it comes along in the stream.
     
     AN ANGLE through the Chrysler's left side window at Lilly,
     driving, concentrating, biting her left thumbnail. She
     becomes aware that's what she's doing, shakes her head in
     irritation: She's trying to break herself of this habit.
     Ostentatiously she tucks the thumb into her fist, rests the
     fist on top of the steering wheel, where she can keep an eye
     on it.
     
     HIGH ANGLE on the westbound lanes. The Chrysler passes. Soon
     it's out of sight among all the other cars. LONG BEAT.
     
     INT. BEDROOM - DAY
     
     AN ANGLE across the unmoving unconscious Roy toward the
     doorway. The apartment door beyond the living room opens,
     throwing light on Roy, who doesn't react. Lilly enters, in
     silhouette, closes the door, crosses toward the bedroom.
     (Until she speaks, we can't be quite sure who this is. With
     the similarity between herself and Myra, this could be Myra.)
     
                         LILLY
                   (hesitant)
               Roy?
     
     No reaction. Lilly, getting worried, moves closer, through
     the bedroom doorway.
     
                         LILLY
               Roy? You asleep?
     
     His head moves slightly. He barely has strength to speak.
     
                         ROY
               Myra?
     
     She moves forward to the side of the bed, only her torso IN
     FRAME. She touches a hand to his forehead.
     
                         LILLY
                   (startled)
               My God!
     
     She turns, hurries back to the living room, looks around for
     the phone, crosses to it, dials, SPEAKS. Roy's eyes open, he
     frowns.
     
                         ROY
               Lilly?
     
     INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
     
     Lilly, hard and fast and urgent, on the phone.
     
                         LILLY
               Tell the doctor I work for Bobo
               Justus, and this is an emergency.
               Don't worry, he knows who Bobo is.
     
     INT. BEDROOM - DAY
     
     AN ANGLE down toward Roy, from above, he's weak but troubled.
     Eyes closed, frowning, whispering.
     
                         ROY
               Go away, Lilly. Go away.
     
     Roy's eyes close. He looks dead. SLOW FADE.
     
     INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
     
     The DOCTOR, a nervous heavyset man in his fifties, a drinker
     from the look of him, is on the phone in b.g., while Lilly
     prowls the room, looking at everything with distaste, then
     stopping to frown at the box-framed clown pictures. She
     doesn't get it. She touches one of the pictures, trying to
     understand. The doctor hangs up, turns to Lilly.
     
                         DOCTOR
                   (lugubrious)
               The ambulance is on the way, for
               what good it will do.
     
                         LILLY
               What? He's going to be all right!
     
                         DOCTOR
               Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some
               sort of accident. He's had an
               internal hemorrhage, he's bleeding
               to death inside.
     
                         LILLY
               Well, make it stop!
     
                         DOCTOR
               His blood pressure is under a
               hundred. I don't think he'll live
               to get to the hospital.
     
                         LILLY
                   (icy, stern)
               You know who I work for.
     
     He's uncomfortable, wants to dismiss that part of his life.
     
                         DOCTOR
               Yes, yes, but that's --
     
                         LILLY
               My son will be all right. If he
               isn't, I'll have you killed.
     
     The doctor stares at her in astonishment, then in belief.
     SOUND of ambulance siren. To break the moment, he crosses to
     the door, opens it. Light bathes Lilly. The doctor steps back
     across the threshold, waiting for the ambulance. He looks
     back at Lilly, who stares at him.
     
     INT. AMBULANCE - DAY
     
     ECU, Roy, skin pallid, eyes closed and sunken, lips white.
     SOUND of siren LOUDER. SOUND SEGUES to CHILD CRYING. CRYING
     FADES.
     
     INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
     
     A clumsy slum hotel fifteen years ago, with a tiny lobby, the
     DESK CLERK at a half-door in one wall. Lilly, at 24, enters
     from the street. This is a definite hooker, with bright
     maroon hair and a black-and-white miniskirt. She stops
     wordlessly at the desk for her key.
     
                         CLERK
                   (handing key)
               Your kid's in the back here. He's
               crying.
     
                         LILLY
               Roy? He's always crying.
     
                         CLERK
                   (sympathetic to Roy)
               The kids beat him up, because his
               home life is, uh, different.
     
                         LILLY
                   (ironic)
               I like you, too.
     
     The clerk shrugs. He doesn't like this tough broad. He turns
     and calls back into his office.
     
                         CLERK
               Roy, your mother's here.
     
     Roy, 10, comes reluctantly out to Lilly, sniffling and
     rubbing his arm.
     
                         LILLY
               So what's your story today?
     
                         ROY
               They twisted my arm.
     
                         LILLY
                   (laughing lightly)
               Only one arm?
     
     He tries not to cry, and shows her a space between his teeth.
     
                         ROY
               They knocked out my tooth!
     
                         LILLY
               Only one tooth?
     
     Roy's frustrated, unhappy, having nowhere else to turn.
     
                         ROY
               You always say that!
     
     Lilly won't take him seriously, but she relents enough to
     stop teasing him, and to pat his head, ignoring how he
     flinches away.
     
                         LILLY
               Come on, kid, let's see if there's
               any food in the house.
     
                         CLERK
                   (there's no food)
               Hah.
     
     Lilly gives him a jaundiced look, walks Roy to the stairs and
     up. The clerk, scornful but sexually interested, watches her
     go.
     
     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
     
     ECU, Roy in a hospital bed, with more color in his face,
     breathing more normally. He begins to react to the sound of
     people speaking.
     
                         MYRA (O.S.)
               No, really, you're Roy's mother?
               That's impossible!
     
                         LILLY (O.S.)
               Not quite. But I'm not sure who you
               are, Mrs... Langtry, was it?
     
     Roy's eyes open, he looks toward the voices.
     
                         MYRA (O.S.)
               I'm Roy's friend.
     
     WIDE SHOT, Lilly and Myra facing one another across the foot
     of Roy's bed, in a two-bed hospital room. (The OLD MAN in the
     other bed sleeps through the scene.) Neither woman is yet
     aware that Roy's awake. Lilly looks Myra up and down, with
     obvious contempt.
     
                         LILLY
               Yes. I imagine you're lots of
               people's friend.
     
     Myra moves one pace to the side, studying Lilly's face.
     
                         MYRA
               Oh, of course, now that I see you
               in the light, you're plenty old
               enough to be Roy's mother.
     
                         LILLY
                   (sweet smile)
               Aren't we all?
     
                         ROY
                   (very weak, but amused)
               Play nice. Don't fight.
     
     The women, startled, both move toward Roy, one on each side
     of the bed.
     
     THREE SHOT, Myra and Lilly both leaning over to look down at
     Roy's sleepy face.
     
                         MYRA
               Darling!
     
                         LILLY
               Roy. You're going to be all right.
     
                         ROY
               Sure I am. What made you turn up,
               after all these years?
     
                         LILLY
               I'm working down in San Diego. Just
               for a few weeks.
                   (awkward laugh)
               Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost
               son.
     
                         ROY
                   (cold)
               Nice to see you.
                   (turns to Myra)
               What am I doing in here?
     
                         MYRA
               You were bleeding inside, honey.
               Remember that bruise you had?
     
                         ROY
               You called the doctor, huh?
     
                         MYRA
                   (reluctant)
               Well, no, Roy. Your mother found
               you.
     
                         ROY
                   (tossing It away)
               Oh, yeah?
                   (very casual, to Lilly)
               Thanks.
                   (back to Myra)
               How long do they say I'm in here?
     
     Myra's willing to fight with Lilly, but Roy's attitude toward
     his mother makes her uncomfortable.
     
                         MYRA
               Roy... Your mom saved your life.
     
     Roy turns his head, gives Lilly an ironic smile. Lilly waits,
     holding herself in.
     
                         ROY
               Yeah? Only one life?
     
     She nods, accepting that, but then responds.
     
                         LILLY
               Second time I gave it to you.
     
     Roy gives her a cold smile, then turns to Myra for the ironic
     explanation.
     
                         ROY
               I was kind of... inconvenient...
               for Lilly.
     
     Lilly has nothing but contempt for Myra. To be humiliated in
     front of Myra -- and by her son -- is the worst thing that
     could happen to her. She makes as dignified an exit as she
     can.
     
                         LILLY
               Well... You're all right now, I
               guess. I have to get down to the
               track.
     
                         ROY
                   (reluctant, but it's
                    necessary)
               Thanks, uh, Lilly.
     
                         LILLY
                   (awkward laugh)
               Don't mention it.
     
                         ROY
               I guess I owe you my life.
     
                         LILLY
                   (faint smile)
               You always did.
     
     Lilly exits. Myra looks after her, curious.
     
                         MYRA
               "Down to the track?"
     
     Roy will not talk about this, with anyone. His response is
     cold, closing the subject.
     
                         ROY
               Her job.
     
                         MYRA
                   (bright smile)
               I want to know everything about
               you.
     
                         ROY
                   (easy grin)
               You do. And once I'm out of here,
               I'll remind you of the best parts.
     
     They smile flirtatiously at one another, both with their
     minds on other things.
     
     INT. BATHROOM - DAY
     
     Very messy, small. Myra showers. She finishes, emerges, wraps
     herself in a towel, opens the crowded messy medicine cabinet,
     removes cosmetics and other items, starts to tweeze her
     eyebrows. Doorbell RINGS. She looks irritated, ignores it.
     Long doorbell RING. Exasperated, she slaps the tweezers down,
     exits.
     
     INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
     
     Another furnished apartment, this one with Myra's clothing
     and dishes and glasses and other junk all over it.
     She crosses to the door, pulls it open. The APARTMENT MANAGER
     enters; a sullen, nervous, heavyset man.
     
                         MYRA
                   (angry, but defensive)
               You heard the shower, didn't you?
     
                         MANAGER
               I don't care about that. This time,
               I gotta have the rent.
     
     Myra forces herself to be more pleasant.
     
                         MYRA
               Joe, I thought I was gonna be all 
               right by now, I just need a little
               more --
     
                         MANAGER
               It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my
               wife. She knows what's going on.
               This time, I gotta have the money.
     
                         MYRA
               Joe, you know you'll --
     
     In gesturing, Myra "accidentally" loses the towel, then wraps
     it around herself again as the manager stares nervously away.
     She smiles, knowing she's got him.
     
                         MYRA
               Joe, could we talk it over? Do you
               want a drink?
     
                         MANAGER
               My wife sent me here, Myra. For the
               money. She's waiting.
     
                         MYRA
               I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock?
               Ten?
     
                         MANAGER
                   (trying to be determined)
               This time...
     
                         MYRA
               We'll work something out, Joe.
     
     She strokes his arm, smiling. He flees. She smiles till he's
     gone, then looks worried, leans her head against the door.
     
     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
     
     Roy, very comfortable in pajamas and robe, sits in a
     wheelchair beside the bed, with magazines lying handy on the
     bed. Myra, irritable, paces beside him.
     
                         MYRA
               I don't see why you're still here.
               You look healthy to me.
     
                         ROY
               I just do what the doctor says,
               babe.
     
                         MYRA
               You're just comfortable, that's
               all. You don't even ask to go home.
               You just lie around, let your mama
               take care of you.
     
                         ROY
                   (truly astonished)
               Mama!
     
                         MYRA
               Who else is paying for all this?
               You badmouth the woman all the
               time, but you sure do take the
               payoffs she gives you.
     
                         ROY
                   (insulted)
               I'll pay Lilly back, don't you
               worry about that.
     
                         MYRA
               I don't like to come here, Roy.
               Every time I do, your mother comes
               in and makes remarks.
     
                         ROY
               That's just Lilly's way.
     
                         MYRA
               And you never defend me. You're
               afraid of her.
     
                         ROY
               Oh, don't be stupid.
     
                         MYRA
               You're a mama's boy, if you want
               the truth. 
     
     This is so absurd, Roy doesn't know how to respond.
     
                         ROY
               Are you kid --? I hadn't even seen
               her in seven years!
     
     Lilly enters, smiling in self-confidence. A large ugly burn
     is on the back of her right hand.
     
                         LILLY
               Should my ears be burning?
     
                         MYRA
                   (surly)
               They might as well.
     
     Lilly gives her a mock-admiring look.
     
                         LILLY
               I heard those skirts were coming
               back.
     
     Myra's not quite up to direct confrontation with Lilly. She
     glowers at Roy instead.
     
                         MYRA
               Get well soon.
     
                         ROY
                   (easy)
               Every day in every way.
     
                         MYRA
               I'll see you when you get home.
     
     Myra stalks out. Acting as though Myra hadn't existed, Lilly
     puts her bag on the bed, takes mail from it.
     
                         ROY
               What happened to your hand?
     
                         LILLY
                   (casually dismissive)
               Just a little accident. I went by
               your place, picked up your mall.
               Just bills, I'll take care of them.
     
                         ROY
               I can take care of my own bills,
               Lilly.
     
                         LILLY
                   (indifferent shrug)
               Whatever you say. The manager says
               your boss called.
                   (crooked grin)
               Really pulled the wool over
               everybody's eyes, huh?
     
                         ROY
               What are you talking about? So I've
               got a job. So what?
     
                         LILLY
               Stop kidding me! Four years in a
               town like Los Ang-gleez, and a
               peanut selling job is the best you
               can do? You expect me to believe
               that?
     
                         ROY
                   (spreads hands; it's
                    obvious)
               It's there. The boss called, you
               said so yourself.
     
                         LILLY
               And that dump you live in! Those
               clown pictures on the walls!
     
     This reference alerts and worries Roy, which he tries to
     hide.
     
                         ROY
               I like those.
     
                         LILLY
               You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball
               clown pictures? Commission
               salesman? It's all a front, isn't
               it? You're on the grift, I know you
               are. You're working some angle, and
               don't tell me you're not because I
               wrote the book!
     
                         ROY
                   (defensive)
               You're one to talk. Still running
               playback money for the mob.
     
                         LILLY
               That's me. That's who I am. You
               were never cut out for the rackets,
               Roy, and if you --
     
                         ROY
               How come?
     
     She considers him. His expression is jaunty, daring her. She
     gives him a somber answer.
     
                         LILLY
               You aren't tough enough.
     
     He's afraid she's right. He covers the doubt with a display
     of self-assurance.
     
                         ROY
               Not as tough as you, huh?
     
                         LILLY
                   (dead serious)
               No. And you have to be.
     
     She holds up her burned hand, showing it to him.
     
                         LILLY
               You asked me about this. You really
               want to know what happened?
     
     He isn't sure he does; but what choice does he have?
     
                         ROY
               Up to you.
     
                         LILLY
               My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus,
               back in Baltimore. When a long shot
               gets too much action, I have to put
               money on that horse at the track,
               because it's the only way to get
               the odds down.
     
                         ROY
               Sure.
     
                         LILLY
               The first day of the Delmar meet,
               there was a nag called Bluebell. I
               should have been on it. But that
               was the day after you came in here,
               so I stuck around to see how you
               were gonna be.
     
     He would speak protest, deny, explain, but she cuts him off.
     
                         LILLY
               That was my choice, nothing to do
               with you. I took a chance, and it
               didn't work out.
     
                         ROY
               Bluebell came in?
     
                         LILLY
               I sent Bobo ten grand of my own
               money, like it was the winnings
               from my bets. I hoped that would
               cover me.
                   (shrug)
               It didn't.
     
     EXT. DELMAR DAY
     
     AN ANGLE on the exit doors toward the parking lot. Lilly
     comes out, self-absorbed, then sees something ahead of her,
     falters briefly, keeps walking, tries a very shaky smile.
     
     REVERSE ANGLE, as Lilly approaches her car. BOBO JUSTUS, 50,
     a blunt hoodlum in a good suit and a civilized veneer, stands
     leaning against the car, arms folded, squinting behind
     sunglasses.
     
                         LILLY
               Hi, Bobo.
     
                         BOBO
               Did I buy you that dress, you piece
               of shit?
     
     Lilly's scared, startled, but trying to figure out how to
     play this.
     
                         LILLY
               Well, I guess so. You're the guy I
               work for.
     
                         BOBO
               You work for me, huh? Then I just
               may flush you down the toilet.
               Drive me to the Durando.
     
     Bobo gets into the passenger seat, while Lilly nods
     convulsive agreement and hurries around to get behind the
     wheel. The car jolts forward, then smooths, and heads for the
     gate.
     
     INT. CHRYSLER - DAY
     
     Driving along the highway. Lilly concentrates on traffic.
     Bobo heavily watches her profile, finally speaks.
     
                         BOBO
               Bluebell.
     
     Lilly's eyes briefly close, her shoulders sag. Then she goes
     back to the silent alert person she'd been. Bobo nods.
     
                         BOBO
               How'd you figure you were gonna get
               away with that?
     
                         LILLY
               I'm not getting away with anything,
               Bobo.
     
                         BOBO
               You're fuckin right you're not. How
               much did your pals cut you in for
               on that nag, huh? Or did they give
               you the same kind of screwing you
               gave me?
     
                         LILLY
               I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not
               as much as I should have been, but
               there was a lot of action on those--
     
     Bobo taps a fingertip against the side of her head to shut
     her up. She shuts up.
     
                         BOBO
               One question. Do you want to stick
               to that story, or do you want to
               keep your teeth?
     
                         LILLY
               I want to keep my teeth.
     
                         BOBO
               Now I'll ask you another. You think
               I got no contacts out here? That
               nag paid off at just the opening
               price. There wasn't hardly a
               flutter on the tote board from the
               time the odds were posted. There
               ain't enough action to tickle the
               tote, but you claim a ten grand
               win!
               You send me ten thousand dollars,
               like I'm some mark you can blow
               off!
     
                         LILLY
                   (terrified, broken)
               Bobo, no, I --
     
                         BOBO
               You wanna talk to me straight up?
     
                         LILLY
               My son --
     
                         BOBO
               Your what?
     
                         LILLY
               My son was in the hospital --
     
                         BOBO
               What the fuck are you doin with a
               son?
     
                         LILLY
               He left home a long time ago. He
               was in the hospital, up in Los Ang
               gleez, real sick.
     
                         BOBO
                   (utter scorn)
               Motherhood.
     
                         LILLY
               I never fucked up before, Bobo.
     
                         BOBO
               You expect me to buy this?
     
     It's time for Lilly to show tough, and she knows it.
     
                         LILLY
               You do buy it, Bobo. I cost you,
               and I'm sorry.
     
     Bobo thinks this over.
     
                         BOBO
               I got a lot of people work for me,
               Lilly. I can't have shit like this.
     
                         LILLY
                   (begging)
               It'll never happen again. I swear.
     
                         BOBO
               It happened once. With me, that's
               making a habit of it.
     
     Lilly drops back to her final position; fatalism.
     
                         LILLY
               You're calling the shots.
     
                         BOBO
               You got any kind of long coat in
               the car? Anything you can wear home
               over your clothes?
     
                         LILLY
                   (deadened with fear)
               No.
     
                         BOBO
                   (doesn't matter)
               I'll loan you a raincoat.
     
     Lilly drives, holding herself together.
     
     EXT. HOTEL DURANDO - DAY
     
     A tall expensive hotel on the coast north of San Diego.
     CAMERA PANS with the Chrysler pulling in and stopping at the
     entrance, then PANS UP the balconied facade.
     
     INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY
     
     Living room of a high-floor suite. CAMERA FACES across the
     room to the balcony and the view of the ocean. Entrance door
     to one side. A supermarket shopping bag is on the coffee
     table. Two THUGS sit on the sofa, watching TV.
     
     The door opens and Lilly enters, followed by Bobo. The thugs
     immediately rise and switch off the TV.
     
                         BOBO
                   (to the thugs)
               Take a walk.
     
     The thugs leave the room as Lilly crosses to stand between US
     and the view, followed by Bobo, neither looking out. Lilly
     turns to Bobo, who abruptly punches her hard in the stomach.
     She falls to the floor.
     
     ANOTHER ANGLE as Bobo steps across her and goes over to close
     the drapes over the view. Lilly sits up, watching him,
     waiting obediently. Bobo looks at her.
     
                         BOBO (CONT'D)
               Get me a bath towel.
     
     She gets up, hurting, and hurries to the bathroom. Bobo sits
     on the sofa, crosses his ankles on the coffee table next to
     the supermarket bag. He takes out and lights a cigar. Lilly
     comes back with a large white bath towel.
     
                         BOBO (CONT'D)
               You ever hear about the oranges?
     
                         LILLY
               You mean, the insurance frammis?
     
                         BOBO
               Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
     
     He kicks over the supermarket bag. Oranges roll on the floor.
     
                         BOBO (CONT'D)
               While you put those in the towel.
     
     Lilly's very scared. She drops to her knees, spreads the
     towel, crawls around gathering oranges while she talks.
     
                         LILLY
               You hit a person with the oranges
               in the towel, they get big, awful
               looking bruises, but they don't
               really get hurt, not if you do it
               right. It's for working scams
               against insurance companies.
     
                         BOBO 
               And if you do it wrong?
     
                         LILLY
               It can louse up your insides. You
               can get puh, puh, puh...
     
                         BOBO
                   (impatient)
               What's that, Lilly?
     
     Lilly pauses, bent over, tightly holding an orange.
     
                         LILLY
               Permanent damage.
     
                         BOBO 
               You'll never shit right again.
     
     He gets to his feet, leaving his cigar in an ashtray.
     
                         BOBO (CONT'D)
                   (hard, impatient)
               Bring me the towel.
     
     Fumbling slightly, she folds the towel edges together to make
     a bag, then stands, brings the towel to Bobo. He makes a
     production out of getting his grip on the edges just right.
     She stands as limp as she can, just wanting to get through
     this. He looks at her without expression, rears back with the
     towel, swings it forward, lets it drop open. Oranges roll on
     the floor. Lilly stares, wide-eyed, recognizing reprieve.
     Bobo tosses the towel behind him onto the sofa, then gestures
     contemptuously for her to pick up the oranges again.
     
     TWO SHOT, closer, as Lilly turns, bending toward the oranges,
     and Bobo picks up his cigar, then lifts a foot and kicks her
     flatfooted, hard, in the back. She sprawls on the floor. He
     follows and drops to his knees on her back.
     
     AN ANGLE close on Lilly on the floor, Bobo's knees grinding
     back and forth into her back.
     
     AN ANGLE on Bobo, grimacing as he bears down, pressing his
     weight onto her back. He leans forward, left hand bracing
     himself on the floor beside her head as he reaches down with
     the cigar held in his right hand and presses the ember
     against the back of her splayed-out right hand.
     
     ECU, Lilly, clenching her teeth, tears squeezing from her
     eyes, simply bearing it.
     
     AN ANGLE on Bobo, catching a bad smell, looking back down
     behind himself at Lilly's body. This is the result he wanted,
     but it disgusts him. He straightens up, still kneeling on
     her, puts the cigar in his mouth, doesn't like its taste,
     removes it, braces his left hand against her back while he
     lifts off her, getting back up onto his feet.
     
     WIDE SHOT, Bobo stepping over her, expression repulsed.
     
                         BOBO (CONT'D)
               Go clean yourself up.
     
     He puts the cigar back in the ashtray as she rises, cradling
     her burnt hand. Not looking toward Bobo, hobbling with knees
     together, she starts from the room.
     
                         BOBO (CONT'D)
               The raincoat's on the bed.
     
     She leaves. He opens the drapes, then picks up an orange from
     the floor and steps out onto the balcony.
     
     EXT. BALCONY - DAY
     
     Bobo stands looking out at the ocean. He enjoys breathing the
     sea air. He slowly peels the orange, dropping pieces of peel
     over the side.
     
     Lilly appears in the doorway, wearing a too-large man's
     raincoat. Bobo doesn't seem to notice her at first, then nods
     to her.
     
                         BOBO
               Almost forgot. That ten grand of
               yours. It's in the envelope by the
               door.
     
                         LILLY 
                   (tries for animation)
               Oh, thanks, Bobo.
     
                         BOBO
               You want a drink?
     
                         LILLY 
               Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I
               still gotta drive back up to Los
               Ang-gleez.
     
                         BOBO 
               See your son, huh? Well, that's
               nice. A side of you I didn't know,
               Lilly.
     
     Lilly chances taking a step out onto the balcony. It's vital
     that she encourage this forgive-and-forget dialogue.
     
                         LILLY
               He's a good kid. A salesman.
     
                         BOBO 
               On the square, huh? And how are you
               making out these days? Stealing
               much?
     
     Bobo's being jolly now. Lilly's scared, but has to be jolly,
     too.
     
                         LILLY
               From you? My folks didn't raise any
               stupid kids.
     
     Bobo's joshing now. He raises a humorous eyebrow.
     
                         BOBO 
               Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
     
                         LILLY
               Oh, well, you know. I just clip a
               buck here and a buck there. Not
               enough to notice.
     
                         BOBO
                   (honest approval)
               That's right. Take a little, leave
               a little.
     
                         LILLY 
               A person that don't look out for
               himself is too dumb to look out for
               anybody else. He's a liability,
               right, Bobo?
     
                         BOBO
                   (this is his creed)
               You're a thousand percent right!
     
                         LILLY 
               Or else he's working an angle. If
               he doesn't steal a little, he's
               steeling big.
     
                         BOBO 
               You know it, Lilly.
     
                         LILLY
               You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I
               don't know what there is about it,
               but it somehow makes you look
               taller.
     
                         BOBO
                   (delighted)
               Yeah? You really think so? A lot of
               people been telling me the same
               thing.
     
                         LILLY 
               Well, you can tell them I said
               they're right.
                   (looks at sky)
               I better get going. Roy'll wonder
               where I am.
     
                         BOBO 
               Worries about his mother, eh? Give
               him a hug for me.
     
                         LILLY 
               I will. So long, Bobo.
     
     Lilly leaves the balcony. Bobo eats more orange, looking out
     at the ocean. His expression is stern but calm.
     
     INT. CHRYSLER - DAY
     
     Lilly drives along the highway, weeping, shaking, teeth
     chattering. Her hands are both high on the wheel, the back of
     the right hand developing a large red burn.
     
                         LILLY
               Lucky! Lucky! Oh, am I lucky.! Am I
               lucky!
     
     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
     
     Roy's appalled and embarrassed and ashamed by this story; the
     surface result is, he's mad at Lilly.
     
                         ROY 
               Lucky? You call that lucky?
     
                         LILLY
                   (simply)
               He let me live. He let me be his
               friend.
     
     Roy in his agitation wheels himself back and forth in the
     wheelchair, bumping into things.
     
                         ROY 
               You don't put up with that! Nobody
               has to put up with that!
     
                         LILLY
               You do if you're where I am. Where
               you want to be. How'd you get that
               punch in the stomach, Roy?
     
     He closes down, sullen, not caring if she believes him or
     not.
     
                         ROY 
               I tripped over a chair.
     
                         LILLY
                   (calm maternal advice)
               Get off the grift, Roy.
     
                         ROY 
               Why?
     
                         LILLY (CONT'D)
                   (faint smile)
               You don't have the stomach for it.
     
     He stares at her, hurt and angry. She stares back,
     unflinching. Angrily, he spins the wheelchair around, his
     back to her.
     
     Now she's hurt. She shrugs, speaks indifferently to his back.
     
                         LILLY 
               I just give you your life. What you
               do with it is up to you.
     
                         ROY
                   (his back turned)
               That's right.
     
     She hesitates, then stalks out, shutting the door.
     
     Hearing the door close, Roy spins around in the wheelchair to
     face where she'd been. He starts to get up, pauses midway.
     
     INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
     
     Angry, Lilly takes a step away from the closed door, then
     stops, looks uncertainly back.
     
     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
     
     Roy, on his feet now, stands still, indecisive.
     
     INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
     
     Lilly shakes her head, turns firmly away, marches down the
     corridor.
     
     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
     
     Roy makes an angry gesture, drops back into the wheelchair,
     spins it around and wheels over to the phone. Quick and
     angry, he makes a call. SOUND of ring; SOUND of click.
     
                         MYRA  (V.O.)
                   (filtered; little-girl
                    flirtatious)
               Myra here. Sorry you missed me.
               Tell me how to reach you and I
               will, just as soon as I can.
     
     SOUND of answering machine beep.
     
                         ROY 
               Babe, I'm gettin out of here, and
               that's it. Let's take some time out
               this weekend, go down to LaJolla,
               hit the beach, have some fun.
               Forget all this other stuff, huh?
     
     Roy hangs up, sits in the wheelchair looking determined.
     
     INT. MADERO LOBBY - DAY
     
     Simms talks with a MAID.
     
                         SIMMS
               Your difference between your folded
               towel and your clean towel is a
               trip to the laundry. When you're
               cleaning those bathrooms, what you
               do, you pick up the towel, you give
               it a good shake and a good look,
               and you say to yourself, 'Would I
               dry myself on this towel?' If the
               answer's yes, fold it.
     
     Roy comes out of the elevator, crossing toward Simms.
     
                         MAID 
               What if it's wet?
     
                         SIMMS
               Mr. Dillon! Welcome back! You look
               fine, just fine.
     
                         ROY 
               Thanks, Mr. Simms, I'm feeling
               fine.
     
                         MAID 
                   (shy)
               I'm glad you're better.
     
     Simms hands Roy a stack of mail.
     
                         SIMMS
               You're well liked around here, Mr.
               Dillon. The entire staff will be
               pleased to see you're back.
     
     Roy's touched and embarrassed by this reaction.
     
                         ROY 
               Well, thank you. And thank them.
     
                         SIMMS 
               Sickness comes to us all, Mister
               Dillon.
     
                         ROY 
               That's true, Mr. Simms.
     
                         SIMMS
               We never know when and we never
               know why. We never know how. The
               only blessed thing we know is,
               it'll be at the most inconvenient
               and unexpected time. Just when
               you've got tickets to the World
               Series. And that's the way the
               permanent waves.
     
                         ROY 
               Well, I'm back now. I just wanted
               you to know. Gotta rush.
     
                         SIMMS
               Happy to see you looking so good.
     
     Roy crosses back to the elevator, enters it. Elevator door
     closes. Simms looks after him, avuncular.
     
                         SIMMS (CONT'D)
               That fellow could be a congressman.
                   (turns to maid)
               If it's wet, you don't fold it. You
               shake it, and hang it neatly on the
               rod provided.
     
                         MAID 
               Yes, sir.
     
     EXT. SARBER & WEBB - DAY
     
     A long low stucco building in an industrial section of Los
     Angeles. The company name is on the glass of the main door.
     KAGGS, a humorless hotshot of 28, dressed in short-sleeved
     white shirt and narrow dark tie, prowls the cracked sidewalk
     in front of the place, MAKING REMARKS into a small cassette
     recorder. Roy's Honda arrives and drives into the company lot
     at the end of the building. Kaggs watches, then goes on
     patrolling and TALKING into the recorder. Roy comes out to
     the sidewalk and heads for the entrance. Kaggs stops and
     watches him approach.
     
                         ROY
                   (cheerful, confident)
               Whadaya say?
     
                         KAGGS
                   (uptight, minimal)
               Hello.
     
     Roy continues on and enters the building.
     
     INT. SARBER & WEBB - DAY
     
     A low rail separates the visitors from an area of desks with
     CLERKS typing or adding up figures or TALKING on the phone.
     Beyond them are floor-to-ceiling bins and shelves with narrow
     aisles between, in which more CLERKS move busily, filling
     orders or doing inventory. A great sense of activity and
     hubbub. Roy enters, looks around in surprise. A clerk at a
     front desk sees him, stands happily.
     
                         CLERK 
               Roy! Welcome back.
     
                         ROY
                   (approaching him)
               What's going on? This is usually
               coffee break time.
     
                         CLERK 
               Not since Kaggs showed up.
     
     Other clerks, aware of Roy, come over with AD LIB GREETINGS.
     
                         ROY
                   (happily basking)
               Hey, yeah, I'm fine, everything's
               great. What's this Kaggs? Sounds
               like a disease.
     
                         2ND CLERK 
               It is.
     
                         CLERK 
               Troubleshooter from the main
               office. Came out here right after
               you went into the hospital, and he
               ain't had a kind word for anybody
               yet.
     
                         3RD CLERK 
               Nobody knows anything but him.
     
                         CLERK 
               He chopped off half a dozen
               salesmen; won't wholesale to them
               any more.
     
                         2ND CLERK 
               What kind of sense does that make?
               They're all on commission.
     
                         ROY
                   (unworried)
               You think he'll chop me?
     
                         CLERK
               If he does, he's crazy.
     
                         2ND CLERK 
               Here he comes!
     
     The clerks all hurry back to their desks as Kaggs enters. He
     crosses to Roy, hand stuck out.
     
                         KAGGS
               Kaggs. Home office.
     
                         ROY
                   (taking his hand)
               Roy Dillon.
     
                         KAGGS
                   (keeping Roy's hand)
               I know that. Knew it when I saw you
               out there. The best salesman here,
               which isn't saying much. Want to
               talk to you, Dillon.
     
     Kaggs moves toward the gate in the rail, still holding Roy's
     hand, to move him along. Roy stands still, which yanks Kaggs
     back. Kaggs frowns at him, releases his hand.
     
                         KAGGS (CONT'D)
               What's up?
     
                         ROY 
               That was a pretty backhanded
               compliment. If I let people get
               away with things like that, I
               wouldn't be a good salesman.
     
                         KAGGS
                   (brisk)
               You're right. I apologize. But I
               still want to talk to you.
     
                         ROY 
               Lead on.
     
     Kaggs leads the way through the rail.
     
     INT. KAGGS' OFFICE - DAY
     
     Small, crowded, efficient, with interior windows showing the
     aisles of bins. Kaggs leads Roy in, shuts the door, gestures
     at the second chair as he goes behind the desk.
     
                         KAGGS 
               Take a seat.
     
     They both sit, Roy amused and observant.
     
                         KAGGS 
               When I said you being the best
               salesman here didn't say much, I
               meant for us. I know your record
               with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say
               you're a top-flight man, but you've
               had no incentive. No one walking on
               your heels. Just a lot of half
               asses, so the tendency's been not
               to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing
               the slobs, incidentally.
     
                         ROY 
                   (dry)
               So I heard.
     
                         KAGGS 
               Makes no difference to me if
               they're only on commission. If they
               don't make good money, they're not
               giving us good representation, and
               we can't afford to have them
               around. Ever supervise salesmen?
     
                         ROY 
               Just myself.
     
                         KAGGS 
               That's right, you've had to
               supervise yourself. This place
               needs a sales manager. Somebody
               who's proved he's a salesman and
               can handle other salesmen. He'd
               have a lot of deadwood to clear
               out, new men to hire. What do you
               think?
     
     Roy doesn't yet know he's being offered the job.
     
                         ROY 
               Sounds like a good Idea.
     
                         KAGGS
               I don't know offhand what your best
               year's been, we can look it up. The
               idea is, we'll top it by fifteen
               percent.
     
     Now Roy gets it. He's startled, almost scared, thinks
     automatically of escape.
     
                         ROY 
               What? Me?
     
                         KAGGS 
               That's just the first year. If you
               aren't worth a lot more than that
               the second year, I'll kick you out.
               What do you say?
     
                         ROY 
               Well, uh... No.
     
                         KAGGS
                   (astonished)
               No?
     
                         ROY 
               I can't take that job! I mean, I
               mean, I can't take it right away.
               I'm still recuperating, I just
               dropped in to say hello, see
               everybody --
     
                         KAGGS 
               I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look
               a little pale. How soon will you be
               ready? A week?
     
                         ROY 
               But you need a man right now. It
               wouldn't be fair to you to --
     
                         KAGGS 
               I take care of the being-fair-to-me
               department. Things've gone to hell
               this long, they can go a little
               longer.
     
                         ROY
                   (trapped)
               Well...
     
     Kaggs gets to his feet, terminating the meeting.
     
                         KAGGS 
               See you in a week, Roy. I can call
               you Roy?
     
                         ROY
                   (rising)
               Oh, sure. Fine.
     
     Kaggs sticks his hand out for another shake. Roy obliges.
     
                         KAGGS 
               And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm
               afraid.
     
                         ROY
                   (distracted)
               Perk.
     
     INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
     
     Roy's place. Roy enters from the bedroom, carrying a
     suitcase, which he drops on the sofa. He goes to one of the
     box-framed clown pictures, takes it off the wall, puts it
     face down on the coffee table, removes two wing nuts holding
     the back, lifts off the back, and reveals stacks of money
     hidden inside. He takes two wads of money out, counting them,
     putting them on the coffee table, then fits the back in
     place, reattaches the wing nuts, and hangs the picture on the
     wall. Stuffing the wads of money into the suitcase, he
     leaves.
     
     EXT. UNION STATION - DAY
     
     A cab pulls up to discharge passengers. Roy and the DRIVER
     get out. Roy pays the driver, who opens the trunk to take out
     several pieces of luggage. Myra leans hesitantly out, as
     though afraid it's raining out there.
     
                         ROY 
               This really is it. Union Station.
     
     Myra comes out of the cab. She's feeling testy. Roy's in a
     good mood and ignores her bad temper.
     
                         MYRA
               I don't see why we have to take the
               train.
     
                         ROY 
               Because it's comfortable.
     
     Myra and Roy burden themselves with the luggage.
     
                         MYRA
               What if we want to drive somewhere
               while we're there?
     
                         ROY
               We'll rent a car.
     
     They start for the station.
     
                         MYRA
               Big spender.
     
                         ROY
               You ain't seen nothin.
     
     INT. TRAIN DAY
     
     AN ANGLE from outside the passenger car through the window at
     Myra, mulish, watching the scenery go by. Beyond her Roy's
     easy, content. He moves to get up.
     
     TWO SHOT, within the train. Myra looks questioningly at Roy
     as he stands.
     
                         ROY
               Stretch my legs. Come along?
     
     She's not ready to relent and enjoy herself.
     
                         MYRA
               No.
     
                         ROY
                   (unruffled)
               See you soon.
     
     He walks down the aisle behind Myra, who sighs and looks out
     the window again.
     
     INT. BAR CAR - DAY
     
     Four young SOLDIERS sit at a table in a rudimentary bar car.
     They're drinking bloody Marys out of plastic glasses and
     having a good time together. In b.g., several customers are
     clustered at the small service bar, waiting for drinks.
     
     AN ANGLE on Roy, at the service bar, looking back past other
     people at the soldiers. He gets his mixed drink, in a plastic
     glass, and turns away.
     
     AN ANGLE on the soldiers as Roy starts by. The train lurches,
     and Roy falls heavily against their table, slopping their
     drinks and spilling some of his own on the table.
     
                         ROY 
               Oh! Ow, I'm sorry! Oh, look, I
               spilled your drinks!
     
                         SOLDIER
               That's okay, don't worry about it.
     
                         SOLDIER 2
               You okay, pal?
     
                         ROY
               Let me buy you a new round.
     
                         SOLDIER
               Hey, no, no problem.
     
                         SOLDIER 3
               You didn't like spill much at all.
     
     Roy firmly places his own glass on their table.
     
                         ROY 
               What are those, bloody Marys? Watch
               this, I'll be back.
     
     He leaves, while the soldiers are still PROTESTING.
     
     INT. TRAIN - DAY
     
     Myra applies makeup, watching herself in her compact mirror.
     She becomes aware of eyes, and looks around.
     
     TWO SHOT, Myra and a BUSINESSMAN, sitting across the way,
     grinning at her. Myra registers him.
     
     CU, Myra, considering the possibilities. Then she shrugs,
     shakes her head at the businessman almost reluctantly, and
     goes back to applying makeup.
     
     INT. BAR CAR - DAY
     
     Roy now sits with the soldiers, eagerly listening to them
     talk. There are plastic glasses enough on the table for three
     rounds of drinks.
     
                         SOLDIER 3
                   (to Soldier 2)
               Yeah, but it was you like told the
               sergeant your grandmother was dead.
     
                         SOLDIER
                   (laughing)
               Again!
     
                         SOLDIER 2
                   (to Soldier 3)
               And you jumped right in.
                   (broad imitation)
               I'll drive him, Sarge, he's too
               distraught.
     
                         SOLDIER 4
                   (astonished)
               Distraught? You said distraught?
     
     They all laugh, Roy laughing with them.
     
                         ROY
               Boy! You guys could've got in a lot
               of trouble.
     
                         SOLDIER 3
               Nah. Old Sarge, he's slowing down.
     
                         ROY
               I don't know. I wouldn't take a
               chance like that.
                   (looks at floor)
               What's that?
     
     They watch as he bends, picks up one die from the floor,
     holds it where they can all see it, his manner open,
     guileless.
     
                         ROY (CONT'D)
               One of you fellows drop this?
     
     INT. TRAIN - DAY
     
     Myra walks down the aisle, demurely looking at no one.
     
     INT. BAR CAR - DAY
     
     Roy's getting to his feet, the soldiers protesting.
     
                         SOLDIER 2
               You can't buy every round!
     
                         SOLDIER 3 
               Like our turn!
     
                         ROY 
               Tell you what. We'll roll for it.
               Low number buys.
     
     He hands the die to Soldier 2.
     
                         ROY 
               Go ahead. You roll for the four of
               you.
     
     The soldiers are confused but agreeable, seeing this as some
     kind of fun.
     
                         SOLDIER 2 
               Here goes.
     
     He tosses the die on the table.
     
                         SOLDIER 3 
               That's a four!
     
     Roy picks up the die.
     
     AN ANGLE close on Roy, his eyes glittering, his fist with the
     die shaking beside his head.
     
     WIDE SHOT. Roy throws. They all look at the die. Roy spreads
     his hands; the good sport.
     
                         ROY 
               Told you I'd buy.
     
                         SOLDIER 
               It just doesn't seem fair, Tom.
     
                         ROY 
               Tell you what. Give me a chance to
               get even when I come back.
     
     INT. TRAIN - DAY
     
     Myra reaches the end of one car, starts through.
     
     INT. BAR CAR - DAY
     
     AN ANGLE on Myra about to enter. She stops, looking through
     the glass in the door.
     
     Myra's POV: Roy and the soldiers rolling the die for money.
     
     ECU, Myra, absorbed, watching.
     
     Myra's POV: MOS through the glass. ECU, Roy's hand with the
     die. ECU, Roy's profile, his smile, his innocent distress
     when he wins. ECU, Roy's hand scoops money.
     
     ECU, Myra, smiling, pleased.
     
     INT. DINER - NIGHT
     
     A brightly lit Hopperish place. Lilly sits alone in a booth
     eating a bowl of chili and reading a newspaper folded beside
     the bowl. A DRUNK with a great deal of faith in his own charm
     sits with a male FRIEND at the counter, drinking coffee. The
     drunk keeps looking toward Lilly, grinning, COMMENTING
     playfully to his friend, who's bored by it all. Lilly doesn't
     seem to be aware of him.
     
     The drunk rises from his stool, turning toward Lilly,
     staggering slightly. His friend makes a small move to stop
     him, then shrugs and lets him go. The drunk makes his way to
     Lilly's table, leans on it.
     
                         DRUNK 
               Pretty woman like you shouldn't eat
               alone. Whadaya wanna eat alone for?
     
     Lilly gives him a flat look.
     
                         LILLY
               Go away.
     
     She looks past him toward the WAITRESS behind the counter.
     
                         LILLY (CONT'D)
                   (calling)
               Could I have some coffee, please?
     
                         WAITRESS 
               Right away.
     
                         DRUNK 
               We could have coffee together. My
               name's Kenny.
     
     Lilly looks over at the drunk's friend, who pointedly ignores
     the situation.
     
                         LILLY
               Your pal wants you.
     
     The drunk could turn mean; his gesture brushing away the idea
     of his friend is stronger than necessary.
     
                         DRUNK
               Let him find his own pretty woman.
     
     The waitress arrives, with the coffee pot and a mug. She puts
     the mug on the table, pours coffee.
     
                         WAITRESS
               This fellow bothering you, Ma'am?
     
                         LILLY
               Yes.
     
                         WAITRESS
                   (to the drunk)
               Why don't you go sit down?
     
                         DRUNK
               I'll sit here. Move over.
     
     The drunk wants to sit beside Lilly, who looks to the
     waitress to solve the problem, but the waitress stands there
     with the coffee pot, looking helpless. The drunk bends to
     slide onto the seat. Lilly, exasperated, rabbit punches him
     in the throat.
     
     The drunk, astounded and in pain (and not breathing),
     staggers back, flailing, hitting the waitress's arm so that
     she slops coffee on him as his feet tangle and he falls
     heavily onto the floor.
     
     Lilly, suddenly concerned, slides out of the booth.
     
                         LILLY
               Oh! Are you all right?
     
     She goes to one knee beside the drunk, who clutches his own
     throat with both hands, retching as he tries to inhale. Lilly
     looks up at the astonished waitress.
     
                         LILLY (CONT'D)
               I shouldn't have hit him that hard.
               I guess I don't know my own
               strength.
     
     The drunk's friend arrives and helps Lilly get the drunk to
     his feet. The drunk is breathing now, but shaken. He looks at
     Lilly with reproachful eyes. His friend transfers his
     annoyance at the drunk to Lilly.
     
                         FRIEND 
               You didn't have to do that.
     
                         LILLY
                   (matter of fact)
               I thought I did. You should take
               better care of your friend.
     
                         DRUNK
                   (mumbled)
               Outta here.
     
     The drunk and his friend head for the exit, as Lilly turns to
     the waitress.
     
                         LILLY 
               I'm sorry a lady can't eat in here
               without being bothered.
     
     The waitress is apologetic, and also in awe of Lilly.
     
                         WAITRESS 
               It won't happen again, Ma'am, I
               promise. Dinner's on the house.
               More chili? Dessert? We have lovely
               pecan pie, my husband makes it
               himself.
     
                         LILLY 
               That sounds nice. Pecan pie. Thank
               you.
     
     Lilly sits down as the waitress goes back behind the counter.
     
     AN ANGLE on the waitress, as she puts down the coffee pot,
     brings out the pecan pie, prepares to slice it, pauses, looks
     with wonder toward Lilly.
     
     EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
     
     The setting is a wide porch or lanai pretending to be a 19th
     century locale; a mix of western and antebellum south; the
     usual tourist confusion of histories. The effect is both
     romantic and false. Roy and Myra linger over wine, near the
     end of their meal. Roy's relaxed, happy, expansive. Myra's
     pleased but watchful, the bird watching the worm.
     
                         ROY 
               You were right, I had to get out of
               that hospital. Nothing wrong with
               me any more.
     
                         MYRA
                   (purring)
               I'll sign that affidavit.
     
                         ROY
               Great to get away, take it easy.
               Next week, I'll get back to work.
     
                         MYRA
               You already went back to work.
     
                         ROY
                   (confused)
               What?
     
                         MYRA
                   (indulgent smile)
               I watched you. Working the tap on
               those soldier boys.
     
                         ROY
                   (elaborate innocence)
               Working the what?
     
                         MYRA
               Oh, come on, Roy.
     
     She mimes rolling the die, slowly, showing how it will roll
     out of her hand just so, then speaks to him as though to a
     bright child.
     
                         MYRA
               The tap. What you do for a living.
     
                         ROY
               I'm a salesman.
     
                         MYRA
               You're on the grift. Same as me.
     
                         ROY
                   (demonstrating patience)
               Myra, I'm not following this.
     
                         MYRA
                   (demonstrating
                    exasperation)
               Roy, you're a short-con operator.
               And a good one, I think. Don't talk
               to me like I'm another square.
     
     Roy leans back, studying her, thinking it over, makes up his
     mind.
     
                         ROY 
               You talk the lingo. What's your
               pitch?
     
                         MYRA 
               The long end. Big con.
     
                         ROY
                   (shaking his head)
               Nobody does that single-o.
     
                         MYRA 
               I was teamed ten years with the
               best in the business. Cole Langley.
     
                         ROY 
               I've heard the name.
     
                         MYRA 
               It was beautiful. And getting
               better all the time.
     
                         ROY
                   (skeptical)
               Is that right?
     
                         MYRA
                   (enthusiasm building)
               It is, Roy! And now, right now,
               it's the perfect time, the best
               time since I've been in the game.
     
     EXT. DESERTED DOWNTOWN - DAY
     
     New skyscrapers are separated by blank fields or small older
     buildings. Almost no traffic. A white limo drives alone down
     the street.
     
                         MYRA (V.O.) 
               All over the southwest, you've got
               these businessmen, they were making
               money when everybody was making
               money, they think that means
               they're smart.
     
     INT. LIMO - DAY
     
     Myra, dressed expensively and fashionably, sits with
     GLOUCESTER HEBBING, a stocky businessman, sixtyish. Their
     manner suggests intimacy.
     
                         MYRA (V.O.)
               And now they're hurting. Everything
               they had was because of oil.
     
     EXT. NEW BUILDING - DAY
     
     Glossy, but no people around. The limo stops, the mustached
     CHAUFFEUR hops out and holds the door as Myra and Hebbing
     emerge and cross to enter the building, Myra carrying an
     attache case.
     
                         MYRA (V.O.)
               They still got money, but they need
               more money, and that's just the
               kind of guy Cole and me like.
     
     INT. LIMO - DAY
     
     The chauffeur gets back behind the wheel, adjusts the
     interior mirror so he can see himself, peels off his
     moustache, scratches his upper lip, refits the moustache more
     to his liking.
     
     INT. ATRIUM - DAY
     
     This building has a central atrium with corridors circling
     it, waist-high walls on the atrium side, glass-walled
     elevators rising up through the atrium. Myra and Hebbing are
     visible in an elevator coming up to a high floor. It stops
     and they exit, moving down the corridor.
     
                         MYRA (V.O.)
               When the oil money was good, they
               put up all these office buildings,
               and now they're half empty.
     
     INT. OFFICE - DAY
     
     ECU, translucent glass in door with company name: COE, STARK,
     FELLOWES & ASSOCIATES, STOCK BROKERAGE - London - New York -
     Dallas - Los Angeles - Tokyo. CAMERA PANS to follow Myra and
     Hebbing as they enter the office.
     
     AN ANGLE showing the well-furnished outer office, the
     attractive and competent RECEPTIONIST welcoming Myra as
     someone she knows, gesturing her through, Myra graciously
     accepting, moving on. Hebbing's impressed by everything,
     trying not to show it.
     
                         MYRA  (V.O.)
               They'll give you anything to move
               in; first two months free,
               redecoration, whatever you want.
     
     AN ANGLE in a clerical office, four CLERKS at well-equipped
     desks with computer terminals, hard at work.
     Maps and clocks on the walls indicate the world. Myra and
     Hebbing pass through.
     
                         MYRA (V.O.)
               They help you set up the store!
     
     AN ANGLE in the PRIVATE SECRETARY'S office, she on the phone,
     nodding and smiling at Myra and waving her through. Myra
     leads the way, opening a door marked HENRY FELLOWES, Partner.
     
                         MYRA (V.O.)
               I'm the roper, I go out and find
               them and bring them in. Cole ran
               the store, and he was the best.
     
     INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
     
     Myra and Hebbing enter an office decorated with sleekly
     understated opulence; the view through large windows is of
     apparently-prosperous skyscrapers. Cole, a plausible rich
     businessman, happily greets Myra.
     
                         COLE 
               Mary Beth! As beautiful as ever.
     
     He lifts a dubious eyebrow toward Hebbing.
     
                         COLE
                   (gentle disapproval)
               I see you brought a friend.
     
     As Mary Beth, Myra has a faint southern-belle accent and a
     clinging flirtatiousness.
     
                         MYRA 
               Mister Hebbing is my bodyguard, my
               strong right arm. Gloucester
               Hebbing, may I present my fine
               stockbroker, Henry Fellowes.
     
     The men shake hands, Hebbing open and pleased and dignified,
     Cole clearly holding something back.
     
                         COLE 
                   (to Myra; gentle warning) 
               Mary Beth, what we have here, uh...
     
                         MYRA
                   (gaily innocent)
               Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about
               it, how brilliant you are at making
               money for your special clients!
     
                         COLE
                   (alarmed)
               Mary Beth, I hope you aren't
               spreading this good news too
               widely.
     
                         MYRA 
               Well, of course not! I know how
               dangerous this is. But I would
               trust Mister Hebbing with anything.
                   (to Hebbing; suggestive)
               Wouldn't I, darling?
     
     While Hebbing looks manly and flustered and pleased, Cole
     brings from under his desk a partially full gray canvas sack
     marked Federal Reserve Bank.
     
                         COLE 
               Well, I'll have to take your word
               for it, Mary Beth. Here's your
               money.
     
                         MYRA
                   (innocent avarice)
               Goody!
     
     Myra opens her attache case on the desk. Cole takes banded
     stacks of bills from the sack, packs them neatly in the case.
     Hebbing tries not to look envious and impressed.
     
     HEBBING'S POV: The top bill in each stack is a hundred.
     
     PREVIOUS SHOT. Myra takes a stack, riffles it for Hebbing's
     benefit.
     
                         MYRA 
               Isn't that just beautiful?
     
                         HEBBING 
               Yes, it is.
     
     Myra returns the stack to the case, talks to Cole.
     
                         MYRA 
               Henry, next time, couldn't Mister
               Hebbing --
     
                         COLE
                   (shocked)
               Mary Beth! This has never been
               anything but --
     
                         MYRA 
               Oh, I know, I know, and you've been
               wonderful since I was widowed. But
               Mister Hebbing has--
                   (to Hebbing)
               -- you don't mind my telling him,
               darling --
                   (to Cole)
               -- suffered reverses. If he
               could...
     
     She gestures vaguely, unable to describe the situation
     accurately. Hebbing fills in, bluff and hearty.
     
                         HEBBING 
               Top up the tanks, as It were. Until
               this little glitch in the oil
               economy comes to an end.
                   (man to man laugh)
               Not that I understand exactly what
               you do, not from Mary Beth's
               explanation.
     
     Cole broods, studying Hebbing, deciding at last to trust him.
     
                         COLE
               Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you,
               and if she told you the story
               already...
     
                         MYRA
                   (girlish laugh)
               So here we are!
     
                         COLE
                   (solemn)
               Mister Hebbing, we are talking
               about breaking the law here, I want
               to be sure you understand that. No
               one gets hurt, but the law does get
               broken.
     
                         HEBBING
                   (a real sport; laughing)
               Well, that's what the law's for,
               isn't it?
     
                         COLE
                   (still serious)
               And I don't just mean the SEC. We
               could have the FBI breathing down
               our necks.
     
                         HEBBING
                   (suddenly serious)
               I certainly hope not.
     
                         COLE 
               Loose talk is the one thing I worry
               about.
     
                         HEBBING
               I can keep my mouth shut, Mister
               Fellowes.
     
     Describing the scheme, Cole becomes increasingly
     enthusiastic.
     
                         COLE 
               Okay, then. Sit down, sit down.
     
     Hebbing sits on the sofa, Myra beside him, holding his arm in
     both of hers. Cole paces, describing.
     
                         COLE 
               The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours
               ahead of us, New York one hour
               behind. There isn't one hour of the
               day when both are open. Information
               moves, but it has to wait. Now, we
               have a young fellow working here --
               Do you know what a hacker is,
               Mister Hebbing?
     
                         HEBBING
               One of those computer geniuses,
               isn't it?
     
                         COLE
               You're right! And this boy tapped
               into that main link between Tokyo
               and the New York Stock Exchange. He
               can give us, when it's really
               useful, a seven second delay in
               that movement of information. Do
               you know what that means?
     
     Hebbing doesn't want to admit ignorance.
     
                         HEBBING 
               Well, you've got your information
               ahead of New York, I see that.
     
                         COLE 
               Every once in a while, a major
               change comes through.
               We have seven seconds to take
               advantage, put our buy order, our
               sell order, into the computer in
               New York before the Tokyo data
               comes in.
     
                         HEBBING 
               Not much time.
     
                         COLE 
               We have to be ready. We have to
               have the money, and we have to know
               what the information means, and we
               have to move immediately.
     
                         HEBBING 
                   (impressed)
               Seven seconds. I don't see how you
               do it.
     
                         COLE 
               These machines -- They're in here.
     
     Cole crosses to an inner door, pushes it partway open, looks
     back grinning with his hand on the knob.
     
                         COLE 
               Want a look?
     
                         MYRA 
               Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
     
     INT. BARE ROOM - DAY
     
     A bare dusty room. A ladder leans against a wall, a paint can
     on the floor beside it. Only Cole is visible in the open
     doorway. He speaks back into the main office.
     
                         COLE 
               Come take a look. An entire-suite
               of main-frame computer.
     
                         MYRA (O.S.)
               We're not really interested, Henry.
     
     INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
     
     Cole remains in the doorway, luring Hebbing with a smile.
     
                         COLE 
               It's quite a sight. You sure?
     
     Cole's pushing this too far. Hebbing's thinking politeness
     requires him to look. Myra's nervous, her smile with an edge
     to it.
     
                         MYRA 
               Henry, don't try Mister Hebbing's
               patience. He knows what machines
               look like.
     
     INT. BARE ROOM - DAY
     
     Cole smiles at the empty room again, looks back.
     
                         COLE 
               Well, if you're sure.
     
     He shuts the door.
     
                         ROY (V.O.) 
               Cole liked to take risks, huh?
     
     EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
     
     Roy and Myra at the table.
     
                         MYRA 
               He didn't think they were risks. He
               was so good, Roy, he could just
               play with the mark.
     
                         ROY 
               And when he got serious?
     
                         MYRA 
               He'd explain he had to have cash,
               so there wouldn't be any paper
               trail for the SEC. And a lot of
               cash, or it wasn't worth while. The
               least we ever took was forty
               thousand, and the most was one
               hundred eighty-five thousand
               dollars! From one sucker!
     
                         ROY 
               I thought these people were broke.
     
                         MYRA 
               No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They
               had savings accounts, stocks to
               sell, houses to mortgage. Sell
               their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had
               a lot of money, when they put their
               minds to it.
               Or when I put their minds to it. I
               stayed with them, that's the
               roper's job, made them get up every
               penny they could raise, turn it all
               over to Cole.
     
                         ROY 
               And a month later, the sucker calls
               the cops and you're on the run.
     
                         MYRA 
               No no! He never calls the cops, not
               after we give him the blow-off.
     
                         ROY 
               Yeah? How?
     
     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
     
     Myra puts a blood-filled four-inch-square plastic package
     into her bra on the left side, then puts on a white blouse.
     
                         MYRA  (V.O.)
               Three or four days after Cole got
               the money, he'd phone the sucker,
               tell him he'd made the move.
     
     EXT. NEW BUILDING - DAY
     
     Myra and Hebbing hurry across the sidewalk from the limo,
     each carrying an attache case.
     
                         MYRA (V.O.)
               Our buy was in the computer, we
               were rich, he should come collect.
     
     INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
     
     Myra and Hebbing enter, Cole meets them, all happy.
     
                         COLE 
               Here you are! Two rich people!
     
                         HEBBING
               I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I
               had moments I was worried.
     
                         COLE
               You brought a case? Good.
     
     Cole brings out the canvas sack from under the desk, reaches
     in, brings out a stack of bills. The door opens and two men
     in suits and topcoats and hats enter, one of them flashing a
     badge. (These are, altered, two of the clerks from before.)
     
                         MAN
               Hold it right there!
     
                         COLE
                   (cool outrage)
               What? This is a private office!
     
                         MAN
               FBI! Stock fraud, tampering with
               Exchange communications --
     
     Cole suddenly loses all control, becomes a gibbering wreck.
     
                         COLE
               Oh, my God! No! The scandal!
     
     The second man approaches Hebbing, pencil and notebook at the
     ready, manner cold and tough.
     
                         SECOND MAN
               Your name?
     
                         HEBBING
               My --? I don't I only --
     
                         COLE
                   (screams at Myra)
               You! You and your goddamn big
               mouth!
     
                         KYRA
                   (terrified)
               Henry, no, I --
     
                         COLE
               Who did you tell? Who?
     
                         MYRA
               Just one or two of the girls, just,
               they wouldn't --
     
     Cole pulls a pistol from his desk drawer.
     
                         COLE 
               Don't move!
     
                         MAN
               Mister Fellowes, that isn't going
               to do you any good. Put that down,
               and --
     
     Cole ignores him, staring in frantic hatred at Myra.
     
                         COLE 
               You ruined me! You destroyed me!
     
                         MYRA 
               Henry, no!
     
     Cole shoots her, the SOUND very loud, the men flinching away.
     Myra slaps her hand to her breast; blood spurts between her
     fingers. In terror, she turns toward Hebbing, who stares at
     the blood seeping down her white blouse. She tries to speak,
     can't. She reaches out, her bloody hand sliding down
     Hebbing's front without getting any purchase, leaving a swath
     of blood diagonally across his jacket, shirt and tie. She
     topples forward. Hebbing tries to hold her, but she slips to
     the floor.
     
     Cole runs around the desk toward the door, waving the gun.
     
                         COLE 
               Get back! Get back!
     
     The men warily move away from the door.
     
                         COLE 
               I'll kill the first one that
               follows me!
     
     Cole runs from the room. The two men pull guns from hip
     holsters under their coat-tails. Hebbing, kneeling beside
     Myra, watches them approach the door, crouch, run through.
     Hebbing rises, looks around, runs to the inner door, finds it
     locked. He crosses to the main door, looks out, cautiously
     creeps from the room.
     
     Myra sits up.
     
     INT. OFFICE - DAY
     
     Hebbing hurries through the empty secretary's office and out
     the other door. The two men enter from a different door and
     cross to re-enter Cole's office.
     
     INT. ATRIUM - DAY
     
     Cole stands behind a pillar, watching. Across the way,
     Hebbing comes out of the office, staring around, trying to
     wipe the blood from his clothes. In obvious panic, he runs to
     the elevator, presses the button.
     
     AN ANGLE through the glass wall into the elevator as it
     stops. The doors open, Hebbing hurries in, frantically jabs
     the button. The elevator descends. CAMERA PANS to Cole coming
     around the corridor, entering the office.
     
     INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
     
     General hilarity. The secretary, two men, other two clerks,
     chauffeur and receptionist are all present, opening
     champagne, Hebbing's money now out of the sack and spread on
     the desk. Myra, stripped to the waist (unconcerned about the
     others present) cleans blood from her breasts with damp
     towels. He and Myra look at one another across the room,
     broadly smile.
     
     EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
     
     Myra's very up, from reliving this story.
     
                         MYRA 
               Oh, Roy, it was great! We were
               rolling in dough, lived wherever we
               wanted, only pulled two or three
               scams a year.
     
                         ROY 
               What happened to Cole?
     
                         MYRA
                   (suddenly evasive)
               He retired.
     
                         ROY 
               Where?
     
                         MYRA 
               Upstate.
     
                         ROY 
               Upstate where?
     
                         MYRA
               Atascadero.
     
                         ROY 
               That's where they keep the
               criminally insane, isn't it?
     
     Myra turns her face away.
     
     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
     
     Expensive room. Cole, naked, expression haunted and crazed,
     sits cross-legged on the bed. Myra enters, happy, carrying
     dress shop boxes. She stops, shocked, when she sees Cole.
     
                         MYRA
               No, baby. Not again.
     
     He stares at the floor over the edge of the bed, like a
     shipwreck victim in a raft looking at the sea.
     
                         COLE
               It's hollow. You'll fall through.
     
     Myra drops the packages on a chair.
     
                         MYRA
               Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
     
                         COLE 
                   (frightened but
                    determined)
               Can't move.
     
                         MYRA 
               It's just the strain again, the
               stress. We'll take a vacation.
     
                         COLE
               It's all hollow. Nothing behind it.
     
     She approaches him, scared but needing him.
     
                         MYRA 
               Cole, you scare me when this
               happens. One of these times...
     
     She touches him. He suddenly lashes out, knocking her
     backward, glaring at her.
     
                         COLE 
               Demon! Demon! That's why you can
               walk on it! Demon!
     
                         MYRA
                   (heartbroken)
               Oh, Cole, please. Please come out
               of it. What would I do without you?
     
     Distracted, gone, unaware of her existence, he gazes around,
     hugs himself, sits staring at demons. She watches him,
     mournful, knowing he's gone.
     
     EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
     
     Myra looks back at Roy. Her expression makes it clear she
     isn't going to tell him any more than she already has.
     
                         MYRA 
               He retired, and that's it. But I
               didn't. I'm still the best long-con
               roper you'll ever see.
     
     Roy laughs, genuinely pleased by her and also tacitly letting
     his questions drop.
     
                         ROY 
               I just bet you are, too. And now
               you're trying to rope me.
     
                         MYRA
                   (pushing enthusiasm)
               Join up with you! I watched you,
               Roy, I've been watching you,
               wondering if I should talk about
               this at all, or maybe just...
                   (shrug)
     
                         ROY 
               Take a hike, you mean?
     
                         MYRA 
               I need a partner, Roy. I need an
               inside man, and you're it. You
               could be as wonderful as Cole.
     
                         ROY 
                   (dubious)
               I don't know, Myra, I never had
               partners. I never needed them.
     
                         MYRA 
               Not to take soldiers for a hundred
               bucks. But how about taking a bank
               president for a hundred grand?
     
     Roy doesn't like this; he's feeling pressured. Myra sees it,
     but believes she's got him anyway, so she can let up. She
     pats his hand.
     
                         MYRA 
               Think about it. Okay?
     
                         ROY
                   (easy to promise)
               Sure.
     
     INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
     
     A little drunk and happy, Roy and Myra come down the corridor
     together, then make it obvious they're going into separate
     rooms, across the corridor from one another.
     
                         MYRA
                   (coy, sexy)
               See you later.
     
     Roy complains, but half-heartedly, half humorously; this
     argument has already taken place.
     
                         ROY 
               I still don't see why we have to
               have separate rooms. You expect
               your father to come through?
     
                         MYRA 
               Separate bathrooms, darling. I will
               not lay out all my cosmetics for
               you to knock over.
     
                         ROY
                   (nevertheless grumpy)
               Things a man isn't supposed to
               know.
     
                         MYRA
                   (soothing)
               You don't mind, really, do you,
               Roy? It's been such a wonderful
               evening, I guess I just wore myself
               out.
     
                         ROY 
               Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
     
     They unlock the opposing doors, look back at one another.
     Myra's smile and good-night wave are consciously cute. Roy's
     response is a little forced. They go into their rooms.
     
     INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Once he's alone, Roy stops trying to look like a good sport.
     Disgusted, he tosses the room key onto the dresser, then
     crosses to sliding glass doors closed in front of a balcony.
     He's about to close the drapes when he looks out, changes his
     mind, unlocks and opens the door. He steps outside.
     
     EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
     
     A high floor, with a wide view of ocean and starry sky. Roy
     leans on the rail, looking out, thinking. He mutters to
     himself.
     
                         ROY 
               Long con. I'm the one's been
               conned. Who needs this?
     
     He continues to stand there, taking some solace from the
     night. BEAT. Phone RINGS. Confused, irritated, he turns to
     look into the room. Phone RINGS. At last, he goes back into
     the room.
     
     INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Roy crosses to pick up the phone, grumpy and suspicious.
     
                         ROY 
               Yeah?
     
                         MYRA (V.O.)
                   (filtered)
               Open your door.
     
                         ROY 
               What?
                   (grins; gets it)
               What for?
     
                         MYRA (V.O.) 
                   (filtered)
               Open it and find out.
     
     Roy hangs up and crosses to the door.
     
     AN ANGLE directly at the door as Roy opens it, showing Myra's
     door open across the way, Myra standing in her doorway naked.
     She waves at him to move over.
     
                         MYRA (CONT'D)
               Gangway!
     
     Roy steps back, holding his door open.
     
     INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
     
     AN ANGLE down the hall as Myra skips across from her room to
     Roy's, her door slamming behind her.
     
     INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Myra runs in, giggling. Roy shuts the door, laughing at her.
     
                         MYRA
                   (coquettish)
               I hope you don't mind, sir. I just
               washed my clothes, and I couldn't
               do a thing with them.
     
     Roy's pleased, but at a loss.
     
                         ROY 
               You -- I don't know.
     
                         MYRA
                   (sudden burst of laughter)
                    )
               If you could have seen your face
               when I told you good night! You
               looked so, so... Ah!
     
                         ROY 
               Oh, come here.
     
     They embrace.
     
     INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
     
     A clean anonymous Holiday Inn. Lilly, dressed for the track,
     sits at the round table under the swag light, sorting through
     her business purse. There's a folded newspaper on the table.
     KNOCK on the door. She's startled. For just a second, she's
     like a trapped animal. Then she's calm again. She turns the
     purse around, opens another zipper section, removes a pistol
     and a silencer, quickly screws the silencer onto the pistol,
     lays the pistol on the table and covers it with the
     newspaper. Then she crosses to open the door.
     
     AN ANGLE to include Roy in the doorway, grinning, easy.
     Lilly's surprised, pleased, but wary.
     
                         LILLY 
               Roy! What are you doing in San
               Diego?
     
                         ROY
                   (entering)
               Myra and me come down to LaJolla
               for the weekend.
     
     Lilly makes a face, but no comment, at Myra's name, as she
     closes the door.
     
                         LILLY
               If you come out to the track, don't
               know me.
     
                         ROY
               We won't hit the track. The beach.
               Couple a nice restaurants.
     
     He takes from his pockets the wads of money held removed from
     the clown pictures, extends them toward her.
     
                         LILLY
               What's that?
     
                         ROY
               Four grand. For the hospital. Is
               that enough?
     
                         LILLY
                   (distressed)
               Roy, I don't want money from you.
     
                         ROY
               I pay my debts.
     
                         LILLY
                   (level skeptical look)
               You do?
     
     Since she won't take the money, he turns to put it on the
     table beside her purse, pushing the newspaper out of the way,
     revealing the gun. He gives it a surprised smile.
     
                         ROY
               Expecting visitors?
     
                         LILLY
               No. That was the point.
     
     She crosses to unscrew the silencer and put both pieces back
     in her purse. Roy, watching, points at the still angry burn
     on her hand.
     
                         ROY 
               You ought to put a bandage on that.
     
                         LILLY
               No can do. Have to dip in and out
               of my bag too much. Besides, it'll
               heal in the air.
     
     Disdainful and hurt, she pushes at the wads of money.
     
                         LILLY (CONT'D)
               Roy, take that back.
     
     His own hostility shows through.
     
                         ROY 
               No.
     
     She's not used to being vulnerable, can neither hide it nor
     really express it; can't use it as a tactic.
     
                         LILLY
               I thought... I was hoping we could
               play it straight with one another.
     
                         ROY 
               I guess not. You'll be heading east
               from here, huh?
     
                         LILLY 
                   (dull)
               After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
     
                         ROY 
               Well... nice to see you again,
               Lilly.
     
                         LILLY
               You, too, Roy.
     
     Roy finds this parting unsatisfactory, but has nothing to
     add. With a shrug, he leaves. Lilly looks after him, her
     expression becoming resentful, dully angry.
     
                         LILLY 
               Prick.
     
     EXT. HOLIDAY INN - DAY
     
     Myra sits in the back seat of a taxi parked across the street
     from the motel. The door to Lilly's room is visible in b.g.
     Roy walks toward the street from Lilly's room.
     
                         DRIVER
               Here he comes.
     
                         MYRA
               I see him.
     
     Reaching the sidewalk, Roy turns to an empty cab parked on
     that side of the street, in front of the motel. Myra's driver
     shifts into gear.
     
                         MYRA (CONT'D)
               Wait. Hold it.
     
                         DRIVER
               That's the guy we're following.
     
                         MYRA
               Just wait.
     
     Roy enters the other cab, which drives away, as Lilly comes
     out of her room in b.g.
     
                         MYRA (CONT'D)
               Ah.
     
     Lilly gets into her Chrysler, backs away from the slot,
     drives to the street.
     
                         MYRA (CONT'D)
               Now we follow her.
     
                         DRIVER
               You're the boss.
     
     AN ANGLE on the two vehicles, as they leave the motel.
     
     EXT. DELMAR - DAY
     
     Where the surf meets the turf. Over the punters' heads, out
     beyond the track, spreads the Pacific Ocean, unnoticed,
     ignored. In every shot in this sequence, the ocean is visible
     but not looked at.
     
     AN ANGLE on Lilly, with her heavy shoulderbag, moving along
     empty tables, here and there picking up used tickets.
     
     AN ANGLE on Myra, on a different level, watching Lilly.
     
     AN ANGLE on Lilly at the betting windows.
     
     AN ANGLE on Myra, on a high vantage point in the stands. A
     MAN near her watches the field through binoculars. Myra ASKS
     if she can borrow them for a minute. Men are always happy to
     do Myra favors; the man gives her the binoculars. She looks
     at the field briefly, then turns and looks through the
     binoculars the other way, outside the track. The man,
     surprised, looks the same way.
     
     MAN'S POV: The parking area.
     
     PREVIOUS SHOT. The man looks in curiosity at Myra, who
     concentrates, adjusting the focus.
     
     MYRA'S POV: Foreshortened through the binoculars, Lilly opens
     the Chrysler's trunk, stashes money.
     
     PREVIOUS SHOT. Myra smiles, turns it into a sweet thank-you
     smile as she returns the binoculars to their owner.
     
     EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY
     
     Roy dives into the pool, swims underwater to the ladder,
     climbs out near a YOUNG BLONDE on a chaise longue, who's been
     admiring him.
     
                         BLONDE
               You stay down real good.
     
                         ROY
               One of my talents.
     
                         BLONDE 
                   (pointing upward)
               Your mother's calling.
     
     Roy looks up.
     
     AN ANGLE to show Myra waving from her balcony, four flights
     up.
     
     PREVIOUS SHOT. Roy's at first surprised, then amused by the
     blonde.
     
                         ROY
               Naughty.
     
     He gathers up his towel and heads for the building.
     
     INT. BATHROOM - DAY
     
     Roy stands in heavy spray in the shower, half asleep, gently
     touching his stomach where the bruise used to be. KNOCK on
     door. He ignores it.
     
                         MYRA (O.S.)
               Roy! You drown in there?
     
     He rouses himself.
     
                         ROY 
               Be right out!
     
     INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
     
     Myra moves away from the bathroom door. She's in a bad mood.
     She paces back and forth, out onto the balcony, then back
     into the room as Roy comes out of the bathroom wearing a
     towel.
     
                         ROY
               You were gone for a while.
     
                         MYRA
                   (casual)
               I went out to Delmar.
     
                         ROY
                   (suddenly wary) )
               The track? Did you run into Lilly?
     
                         MYRA 
               I saw her.
     
                         ROY
               She didn't see you, in other words.
     
                         MYRA 
               I'm not trying to make trouble,
               Roy. It's just, she's always so
               nasty to me, I thought, who is she
               to be so high and mighty. I saw her
               out there, and I called a friend of
               mine in Baltimore, so now I know
               who she is.
     
                         ROY
                   (dry)
               You must have some very
               knowledgeable friends.
     
                         MYRA 
               I'm well connected, Roy, Cole
               introduced me to a lot of people.
               Very valuable. Valuable for us.
     
                         ROY 
               Running your broker scam, you mean.
     
                         MYRA
                   (enthusiastic)
               You and me, Roy. What a team we'll
               make. We think alike; we get along
               together.
               Once or twice a year we take some
               slob, the rest of the time we live
               like this. You won't regret this,
               Roy.
     
                         ROY
               Regret what? I didn't say I was
               coming aboard.
     
                         MYRA 
               But why not? I thought it was
               settled. What's holding you back?
     
                         ROY 
               Come on, Myra, don't talk business
               here. This is time out.
     
     She considers him.
     
                         MYRA 
               You mean, it would be too tough to
               give me a turndown here. Easier on
               home grounds.
     
                         ROY
                   (shrug)
               Yes or no. They're both easier at
               home. Okay?
     
     Myra makes a visible effort to be accommodating.
     
                         MYRA 
               Whatever you say, darling.
     
     INT. KAGGS' OFFICE - DAY
     
     Kaggs sits at his computer terminal, bringing up data, not
     pleased by what he sees. Buzzer SOUNDS. He swivels to the
     desk, presses the intercom button.
     
                         KAGGS 
               Yeah?
     
                         RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
               Roy Dillon, Mr. Kaggs.
     
                         KAGGS 
               Good! Send him in.
     
     With a now-we're-getting-somewhere manner, Kaggs turns back
     to the VDT, punches up a different set of data, sits looking
     at it in gloomy satisfaction. Roy enters, and Kaggs rises,
     extending his hand across the desk. They shake hands.
     
                         KAGGS 
               Good to have you back, Roy. I was
               just looking at --
     
                         ROY 
               Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
     
                         KAGGS 
                   (keen)
               You're turning me down? Makes no
               sense, Roy.
     
                         ROY 
               I guess I'm just not a leader of
               men.
     
                         KAGGS 
               Oh, come on, Roy.
     
                         ROY 
               The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
     
                         KAGGS 
               Perk, remember?
     
                         ROY 
               Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I
               like things the way they are now.
               Pick my own hours, have time for,
               uh, other activities...
     
                         KAGGS 
               A well-rounded life. I respect
               that. But it has to have a center,
               Roy, something you care about,
               something you can think about.
     
                         ROY 
               Maybe I'm just not ready for that
               yet.
     
                         KAGGS
                   (deep sigh)
               Well, Roy, if that's the way you
               feel, I won't badger you.
                   (forced laugh)
               Don't want to lose you as a
               salesman, too.
     
                         ROY 
               Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep
               everything the way it was.
     
                         KAGGS 
               That's what we'll do, then. But I
               tell you what, Roy. Before I hire
               anybody else, I'll ask you one last
               time. Fair enough?
     
                         ROY 
               Fair enough.
     
     They shake hands.
     
     INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
     
     Roy's room. He has one of the clown pictures face down on the
     coffee table. He takes money from his jacket pockets, crams
     it into the space, which is now just about full. As he's
     tightening the wing nuts closing the back, doorbell RINGS. He
     hurries, finishing the job, hanging the picture on the wall,
     then crossing to open the door. Myra enters, ebullient.
     
                         MYRA 
               Darling, guess what? I had to tell
               you right away.
     
     She gives him an enthusiastic kiss, then marches into the
     living room.
     
                         ROY 
                   (grinning)
               And hello to you, too.
     
                         MYRA 
               I called a fellow I know in Tulsa,
               the one who plays my chauffeur.
               There's a sucker there he says is
               made for us. And a boroker that
               just shut down, we can use their
               office, not change a thing! Now, I
               can scrape up ten grand without
               much trouble. That leaves fifteen
               or twenty for your end. We could
               start this weekend, get the sucker
               into position --
     
                         ROY 
               Wait a minute! When did this
               happen, that we're partners?
     
                         MYRA 
                   (bewildered)
               What?
     
                         ROY 
               The last I looked, we were just
               talking things over.
     
                         MYRA 
               But the setup's there. It's there
               now.
     
                         ROY 
               I don't think I need it.
     
                         MYRA 
               You're too good for the small-time,
               Roy. Move up to where there's big
               dough to be made, and you don't
               have to stick your neck out every
               day.
     
                         ROY 
               Maybe I like it where I am.
     
     Myra's need breaks through her good sense.
     
                         MYRA 
               Well, maybe I don't! I had ten good
               years with Cole, and I want them
               back! I gotta have a partner! I
               looked and I looked and believe me,
               brother, I kissed a lot of fucking
               frogs, and you're my prince!
     
     Roy tries to treat this lightly.
     
                         ROY
               Don't I get any say in this?
     
                         MYRA 
               No! Because I --
     
                         ROY
                   (pointing at her)
               That's what I say.
     
                         MYRA
                   (thrown off course)
               What?
     
                         ROY 
               What I say is, no. We don't do
               partners.
     
                         MYRA (CONT'D)
                   (raging)
               For Christ's sake, why not?
     
                         ROY 
               Mostly, because you scare the shit
               out of me. I've seen people like
               you before, baby. Double-tough and
               sharp as they come, and you get
               what you want or else. But you
               don't make it work forever.
     
                         MYRA 
               Bullshit!
     
                         ROY 
               No; history. Sooner or later, the
               lightning hits. I don't want to be
               around when it hits you.
     
     She stares at him, trying to find a chink in the armor,
     trying to find a reason, trying to find something.
     
                         MYRA 
               What is it? What's going on?
     
                         ROY 
               I'm happy the way I am.
     
                         MYRA 
               By God, it's your mother. It's
               Lilly.
     
                         ROY
                   (doesn't get it) )
               What?
     
                         MYRA 
               Sure it is. That's why you act so
               funny around each other.
     
     He frowns at her, not believing he understands her right.
     
                         ROY 
               What's that?
     
                         MYRA 
               Don't act so goddamned innocent!
               You and your own mother, gah! You
               like to go back where you been,
               huh?
     
     He takes a step toward her, rising toward fury.
     
                         ROY 
               You watch that mouth.
     
                         MYRA 
               I'm wise to you, I should have seen
               it before, you rotten son of a
               bitch. How is it, huh? How do you
               like --
     
     He slaps her openhanded but hard, and she staggers back. He
     pursues her.
     
                         ROY 
               How do you like this?
     
     He slaps her as hard with the other hand. Astonished,
     frightened, befuddled, she backpedals, bringing her forearms
     up to protect her face. He grabs her two wrists in one hand,
     holds them out of the way, slaps her forehand and backhand,
     forehand and backhand.
     
                         MYRA 
               STOP!!
     
     He suddenly gets control of himself, releases her, steps back
     into the middle of the room. He's angry, but also remorseful,
     sorry he lost control but still enraged at the enormity of
     her suggestion.
     
                         ROY 
               That's not like me. I don't do
               violence.
     
     She cowers against the wall, peering in terror at him through
     her raised arms. He settles down, becomes heavily calm.
     
                         ROY 
               That's why we wouldn't work
               together. You're disgusting. Your
               mind's so filthy, it's hard even to
               look at you.
     
     He crosses to the apartment door, pulls it open. Sunlight
     pours in.
     
                         ROY 
               Goodbye, Myra.
     
     She lowers her arms slowly, as though her whole body aches.
     She's still scared, but angry now, too. She'd like to tell
     him off, but discretion tells her not to. She moves across
     the room toward the open door, but stops, not wanting to be
     that close to him.
     Understanding, he backs away from the doorway, gestures with
     cold irony for her to proceed. She moves to the threshold,
     looks back at him.
     
                         MYRA 
               And you don't even know it.
     
     Angry again, Roy steps forward. She hastily steps outside,
     and he slams the door.
     
     EXT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY
     
     Myra moves slowly along the balcony, muttering to herself.
     
                         MYRA 
               Mama. It's Mama. She's the one.
     
     She stops, holding the balcony rail, looking out at the city.
     
                         MYRA 
               You'll get yours, Mama. Oh, yes.
     
     INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
     
     Lilly's room; empty. Phone RINGS. Lilly enters, tired, with
     her shoulderbag; the end of her work day. Phone RINGS. She
     frowns at it, expecting nothing good, then drops the
     shoulderbag on the bed, crosses, answers.
     
                         LILLY 
               Yes?
     
     A sudden smile doesn't entirely hide the wariness.
     
                         LILLY 
               Roy! An unexpected pleasure.
     
     INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
     
     Roy, troubled, paces while talking on the phone.
     
                         ROY 
               Lilly, I've got a couple things to
               think about. Well, kind of job
               offers, kind of. Different ways to
               go. I'd kind of like to talk them
               out, you know? Maybe just hear
               myself talk.
     
     INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
     
     Lilly's delighted, but can't trust this moment more than any
     other.
     
                         LILLY 
               Well, sure, Roy. You want me to
               drive up --? Okay, fine, come on
               down.
                   (kidding)
               It won't be a home-cooked meal, you
               know.

                         ROY
                   (kidding)
               Well, that's good news.
     
     He hangs up, but he's nervous, still uncertain, pacing.
     
                         ROY 
               Well? Who's a boy gonna talk to, if
               not his mother?
     
     The sound of the question makes him laugh.
     
     EXT. MOTEL - DAY
     
     Myra's Cadillac eases to a stop across the street, where she
     earlier waited in the cab.
     
     AN ANGLE through the windshield at Myra, settling down to
     wait, looking at the motel.
     
     INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Lilly comes out of the bathroom, putting her lipstick away in
     a small purse. She's dressed carefully for tonight; upscale
     and respectable, without being stodgy. She crosses to the
     window -- night view outside -- and as she pulls the drapes
     shut the phone RINGS. She looks at it in disappointment,
     crosses to answer.
     
                         LILLY
                   (expecting rejection)
               Roy?
     
     INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
     
     Irv the accountant's office in Baltimore. He looks secretive
     and scared, talks in a hush.
     
                         IRV 
               Lilly, listen, it's Irv. You were
               always decent with me, I'm taking a
               hell of a chance here.
               Somebody blew you out with Bobo.
               The car full of money. He's --
               Lilly?
     
     INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Empty. The phone receiver dangles off the table on its cord.
     The door finishes closing.
     
     EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
     
     Lilly's Chrysler jounces out to the street, moving too fast,
     making the turn, racing away. CAMERA PANS to Myra's Cadillac,
     pulling away from the curb, following. CAMERA HOLDS with the
     two cars receding in b.g.
     
     INT. HONDA - NIGHT 
     
     Roy drives down a San Diego street, is stopped by a red
     light, looks at his watch. He's late.
     
                         ROY 
               Damn.
     
     INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Empty; as before. The door opens and the two thugs we saw
     earlier with Bobo enter, one putting a thick ring of keys
     away in his jacket pocket. They close the door, look around
     the room. One goes to the closet, opens it, looks at the
     clothing inside, while the other goes into the bathroom. The
     first crosses to the dresser, pulls open a drawer full of
     clothing. The second comes out of the bathroom. They look at
     one another. The guy from the bathroom shakes his head. The
     other one points at the dangling phone, speaks.
     
                         THUG
               Somebody spooked her.
     
                         SECOND THUG
               White Chrysler.
     
                         THUG
               Full of cash.
     
     They leave the room.
     
     EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
     
     Roy walks toward Lilly's room as the two thugs pass him, on
     their way out. Roy knocks on Lilly's door, waits, knocks
     again.
     He tries to look through a crack in the drapes into the room,
     then turns to look at the empty place where Lilly's Chrysler
     had been. He shakes his head, knocks once more, looks at his
     watch, turns away.
     
                         ROY
                   (disgusted)
               Thanks a lot, Lilly.
     
     He walks off.
     
     EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
     
     Lilly's white Chrysler pulls off the road into the front
     parking area of a new small motel. The car brakes to a stop.
     
     AN ANGLE from the road as Myra's blue Cadillac drives slowly
     by, while, in b.g., Lilly gets out of the Chrysler, moving as
     though she's stiff and tired. Lilly enters the motel office.
     
     INT. MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
     
     The CLERK, an elderly woman, turns away from a small TV set
     when Lilly enters.
     
                         CLERK
               Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
     
                         LILLY 
               Good evening. I'd like a single for
               tonight.
     
                         CLERK 
               Oh, everything's the same size,
               same price.
     
     The clerk extends a registration card and pen to Lilly, who
     takes them but doesn't yet start to write.
     
                         LILLY
               I'm a very light sleeper, traffic
               noise keeps me wide awake all
               night.
     
                         CLERK
                   (sympathetic)
               Those trucks. I know exactly what
               you mean.
     
                         LILLY
               Do you have something around back,
               facing away from the road?
     
     The clerk turns to consider the key rack.
     
                         CLERK
               I'll put you in one thirty-one.
               Very quiet. Faces the desert.
     
                         LILLY
               Sounds perfect. I can park my car
               back there?
     
                         CLERK 
               Right in front of the room.
     
                         LILLY 
               Fine.
     
     She starts to fill in the registration card.
     
                         LILLY
               And I'll want to leave an early
               wake-up call.
     
                         CLERK 
               No problem. My husband gets up the
               crack of dawn.
                   (confidential)
               It's his kidneys.
     
     EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
     
     Motel in b.g. The blue Cadillac, having turned around and
     come back, pulls off onto the shoulder of the road about
     fifty yards short of the motel.
     
     INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
     
     Over Myra's shoulder as she watches, through the windshield,
     the Chrysler parked in front of the motel. Lilly comes out of
     the office over there, gets into the Chrysler, backs it up,
     drives it out of sight past the motel. Myra puts the Cadillac
     in gear.
     
     INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
     
     A clean anonymous motel room, with two beds. Lilly enters,
     very weary, puts her shoulderbag on one of the beds, goes
     back outside and leaves the door open. She has backed the
     Chrysler into its spot just outside her room, so its trunk is
     visible through the open doorway.
     
     EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
     
     AN ANGLE on Lilly as she opens the rear door of the Chrysler
     and leans in.
     
     INT. CHRYSLER - MIGHT
     
     Lilly wrestles the rear seat out of position, reaches down
     into the space under and behind it, and brings out a soft
     cloth overnight bag. It seems not too full but fairly heavy.
     She puts the bag on the ground outside the car and then
     pushes and prods the seat back into position.
     
     EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
     
     Lilly shuts the car door, picks up the bag, and enters her
     room, shutting the door behind her.
     
     INT. MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
     
     Myra enters. The clerk looks at her in surprise.
     
                         CLERK 
               Something wrong?
                   (embarrassed)
               I'm sorry. I thought you were the
               other lady.
     
                         MYRA 
               No. I'm me.
     
     INT. ROOM 231 - NIGHT
     
     Lilly puts the bag on the bed with her shoulderbag. She opens
     the overnight bag, takes from it a blond wig, a pair of horn
     rim glasses and a passport. From her shoulderbag she takes
     the pistol and silencer. She attaches the silencer to the
     pistol and puts the pistol under the pillow of the other bed.
     
     INT. MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
     
     Myra's checking in. She fills in the registration card while
     the clerk considers her key rack.
     
                         CLERK 
               I'll give you one oh seven. That's
               a very nice room, very handy, in
               the front, right by the pool.
     
                         MYRA 
               Oh, don't you have something around
               back, where it's quieter?
     
     The clerk sighs, looks at the key she'd taken from the rack,
     reluctantly goes back to consider the situation again.
     
                         CLERK 
               Everybody wants the back tonight.
     
                         MYRA 
               I guess everybody wants privacy.
     
     INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
     
     Lilly, in nightgown, yawning, comes out of the bathroom,
     switching off its light. The shoulderbag and overnight bag
     and overnight bag's contents are still on one bed. Lilly gets
     into the other, switches off the light.
     
     INT. ROOM 119 - NIGHT
     
     Virtually identical to Room 131. Myra enters, lugging a
     suitcase, and shuts the door behind herself. She puts the
     suitcase on one of the beds, opens it, paws through it, and
     brings out slippers, nightgown and robe. Briskly, she strips
     and puts on the nightgown, the slippers and the robe.
     
     Back into the suitcase, she brings out a small snubnose
     pistol which she puts in the pocket of her robe. Next out of
     the suitcase is a large ring of keys.
     
     Sitting on the other bed, she compares her room key with keys
     on the ring, takes three keys from the ring, and puts them in
     her robe pocket along with the room key.
     
     Getting to her feet, she crosses to the dresser, picks up the
     ice bucket, and leaves the room, closing the door behind
     herself.
     
     EXT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
     
     CU, the door, with its number. CAMERA PANS to pick up Myra,
     approaching. She stops at room 132, looks at the Chrysler,
     smiles at it in proprietary fashion, and pats the Chrysler on
     the trunk.
     
     Then she turns to the room. She takes the keys from her
     pocket, looks around to be sure she's alone, and bends over
     the lock.
     
     INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
     
     In very dim light, Myra enters the room, closes the door,
     moves toward the beds. CAMERA PANS with her. Keeping her eyes
     on the sleeping form of Lilly, she puts the empty ice bucket
     on the empty bed, then moves closer to Lilly. CAMERA PANS in,
     moving forward as Myra's arms move forward, moving to CU on
     Lilly as Myra's hands (remaining IN FRAME) move forward and
     down. Her hands abruptly clamp on Lilly's throat. QUICK CUT.
     
     EXT. PHOENIX AIRPORT - DAY
     
     ESTABLISHING SHOT. A plane lands.
     
     INT. PHOENIX AIRPORT - DAY
     
     Roy, looking stunned, is among the deplaning passengers
     spreading out across the terminal. He's met by PIERSON, a
     plainclothes detective, and a uniformed COP.
     
                         PIERSON 
               Roy Dillon?
     
                         ROY 
               Yes?
     
                         PIERSON 
               Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police.
               I have a car here.
     
                         ROY 
               Thank you.
     
     INT. POLICE CAR - DAY
     
     The uniformed cop drives. Pierson and Roy sit in back.
     
                         PIERSON 
               I realize this is a shock.
     
                         ROY 
               Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
     
                         PIERSON 
               That's natural.
     
                         ROY 
               No. I mean, I don't believe it.
               Lilly is not a suicide. I know my
               mother, nothing would make her
               check out.
     
                         PIERSON 
               I'm sorry, it was her all right.
               Her gun, even.
     
                         ROY 
               Gun?
     
                         PIERSON 
               I grant you, it's a little odd,
               shoot yourself with a gun with a
               silencer on it, but it was hers,
               all right. It really is your
               mother, Mister Dillon.
     
                         ROY 
               It may be Lilly, but it isn't
               suicide.
     
                         PIERSON 
                   (interested)
               Do you have any particular reason
               to say that?
     
                         ROY 
               My mother... Well, I guess it
               doesn't matter now. She worked for
               gamblers. She always knew they
               might turn on her some day.
     
                         PIERSON
                   (thoughtful)
               A hit, you mean. Honestly, it
               doesn't have that feel to it, but
               I'll certainly consider the
               possibility. Thank you for telling
               me.
     
     The car stops.
     
                         ROY 
               Not that it matters.
                   (looks out)
               This is the morgue?
     
                         PIERSON 
               You up to it now?
     
                         ROY 
               Sure. Let's get it over.
     
                         PIERSON 
               One thing I have to caution you
               about. A gunshot wound...
     
                         ROY
                   (impatient)
               Yes, I know, I know.
     
                         PIERSON
                   (reluctant)
               Well, uh, you know, she ate the
               gun.
     
                         ROY
                   (not understanding)
               What?
     
                         PIERSON 
               I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate
               phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to
               tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon,
               this isn't an everyday occurrence
               around here.
     
                         ROY
                   (low; getting it)
               Ate the gun. Oh.
     
                         PIERSON 
               Someone who knows her well could
               still identify her, that's not the
               problem. It's just there's, uh,
               it's likely to be a shock.
     
                         ROY
                   (opening the door)
               Well, let's get the shock over
               with.
     
     INT. MORGUE VIEWING ROOM - DAY
     
     A bare bright room with tiled walls, a few plastic chairs, an
     ordinary office door on one side and wide hospital swinging
     doors on the other. Pierson and Roy stand watching.
     
                         ROY 
               Not many laughs in this room, eh?
     
                         PIERSON 
               Not many.
     
     The swinging doors open and an ATTENDANT wheels in a gurney
     containing a body covered by a sheet. Roy braces himself. The
     attendant pulls the sheet away from the face.
     
                         PIERSON (CONT'D)
                   (to the attendant)
               Remove that. We'll want a full, uh,
               identification.
     
     The attendant removes the sheet. The body wears a nightgown.
     
     AN ANGLE on Roy, swallowing bile, as he forces himself to
     move forward and look down at the face. He immediately looks
     away again.
     
                         ROY 
               Oh, Jesus.
     
                         PIERSON 
               No question, huh?
     
                         ROY 
               No, its -- Why did she--?
     
     He forces himself to look at the body again, his own face
     full of the unanswerable question. He looks her up and down,
     then his eyes stop. He focuses on something, a look of
     surprise coming into his eyes.
     
     Roy's POV: CU, the body's hands, crossed over the stomach,
     the wrists crossed, the palms down, the clear backs of both
     hands visible.
     
     CU, Roy. He knows. Sharpness comes back into his expression.
     
                         PIERSON  (O.S.)
               That's that, then.
     
                         ROY
                   (starting to grin)
               Oh, yeah. That's that.
     
     TWO SHOT, Roy and Pierson. Pierson wants to leave, but Roy
     stands over the gurney. He chuckles. Pierson looks at him,
     surprised and appalled. Roy ignores him.
     
                         ROY (CONT'D)
                   (laughing quietly)
               Mom.
     
     QUICK CUT.
     
     EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
     
     MONTAGE. Myra's baby blue Cadillac drives, at extreme high
     speed, alone on the highway.
     
     EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - NIGHT
     
     Myra's Cadillac drives slowly past, comes to a stop at the
     curb half a block away.
     
     INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
     
     AN ANGLE through the windshield at the driver, a woman,
     deeply weary. Her forearms are crossed on top of the steering
     wheel, her brow resting on the forearms. The burn on the back
     of her right hand is visible in illumination from a nearby
     streetlight. Traffic goes by. BEAT. Lilly lifts her head,
     looking out at the night. She's very tired, but determined.
     
     AN ANGLE beside Lilly, inside the car. From the seat beside
     her she picks up Myra's large dangly earrings and fixes them
     in place. Then she puts on Myra's big-lensed dark sunglasses.
     (She's wearing the clothes Myra wore when checking into the
     motel.) Lilly checks her appearance in the rearview mirror,
     then gets out of the car.
     
     INT. MADERO LOBBY - NIGHT
     
     AN ANGLE on Simms at the desk, talking to a TELEPHONE
     REPAIRMAN steadily at work fixing the switchboard.
     
                         SIMMS
               The last modern thing I liked was
               the miniskirt. Your technology,
               now, nobody understands it, and
               that's the simple fact of the
               situation.
     
     Lilly enters in b.g., crosses to the elevator, presses the
     button. Simms waves to her.
     
                         SIMMS
                   (calling) )
               Evening, Mizz Langley!
     
     The elevator door opens, Lilly boards and presses the button.
     The elevator door closes.
     
                         SIMMS
               New things come in here all the
               time, how do they work? You can ask
               your Ph.Ds, your highly educated,
               intelligent, professional people,
               you can say to them, how does that
               work, and you know what they'll
               tell you? You plug it in. And
               that's the way the donut dunks.
     
     EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS BALCONY - NIGHT
     
     The balcony leading to Roy's apartment. It's illuminated by a
     light next to the public door from the interior hall.
     AN ANGLE on that door as Lilly cautiously opens it, looks out
     and around while remaining mostly behind the door, then
     focuses on the light. She reaches out and unscrews the bulb.
     GO TO BLACK.
     
     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Roy's place. Dark. SOUNDS of lock being picked. The door
     opens, showing only blackness outside, Lilly enters and shuts
     the door, then switches on the main light.
     
     Ah ANGLE on Lilly, in the middle of the room, distractedly
     biting her thumbnail as she looks around, calculating. She
     looks directly at something.
     
     Lilly's POV: One of the box-framed pictures hanging on the
     wall.
     
     PREVIOUS SHOT. Lilly, making up her mind, crosses to the
     picture and takes it off the wall. She finds it surprisingly
     heavy. She carries it to the coffee table, puts it down there
     on its back, sits on the sofa.
     
     AN ANGLE on Lilly studying the picture. She raps her knuckle
     against the sides, looks to see if the front or sides open
     someway, and finally turns the picture over, laying it face
     down on the coffee table. She sees how to remove the back,
     lifts it off, and looks at the stacks of money lying in
     there.
     
     CU, Lilly, almost fainting with relief.
     
     WIDE SHOT. Lilly looks at the other picture, looks again at
     the money, comes to a conclusion. She rises and leaves the
     room, deeper into the apartment.
     
     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     Lilly switches on the light as she enters the room. She looks
     around, crosses to the closet, goes through the stuff in
     there, finds an old attache case on the shelf. She brings it
     out, puts it on the bed, opens it. Inside are a few decks of
     cards and a paperback book. She tosses them onto the bed,
     checks the case, finds that one of the clasps works but the
     other doesn't. One is good enough. She carries the attache
     case out of the room, leaving the light on.
     
     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Lilly enters, puts the case on the coffee table beside the
     picture, scoops the money out of the picture and puts it in
     the case. Then she unceremoniously dumps the picture on the
     floor.
     
     Lilly takes the second picture from the wall, puts it face
     down on the coffee table, opens the back, transfers the money
     to the case. She closes the case, attaches the one clasp that
     works, picks up the case.
     
                         ROY (O.S.)
               Hello, Lilly.
     
     TWO SHOT, as Lilly whirls around, terrified and then
     relieved. Roy stands in the open apartment doorway, blackness
     behind him.
     
                         LILLY
               Oh! Roy! You scared me.
     
     Roy enters the room and shuts the door.
     
                         ROY
               Going somewhere?
     
                         LILLY
               Somewhere else, that's for sure.
     
                         ROY
               I just came back from Phoenix.
     
                         LILLY 
                   (anxious)
               Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
     
                         ROY
               Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down.
               Take a minute, tell me about it.
     
                         LILLY 
               I've really got to --
     
                         ROY
               You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
     
                         LILLY 
               Not for long. Not when they do a
               fingerprint check.
     
                         ROY 
               Why should they? The cops are
               satisfied.
     
                         LILLY 
               Bobo won't be. He'll spend the
               money to make sure.
     
                         ROY 
               Even so. You still got time. Relax
               a minute, tell me what happened.
               Sit down.
     
     He gestures at the sofa. Lilly's holding the attache case.
     The gutted pictures are lying around, one on the coffee table
     and one on the floor. She looks around at everything, awkward
     and embarrassed. But Roy hasn't said anything. And he's
     between her and the door.
     
                         LILLY
               Just for a minute.
     
     She backs up, sits on the sofa, puts the case on her lap. Roy
     pulls a chair over so it's directly between Lilly and the
     door. He sits, looking at her with polite interest.
     
                         ROY 
               Myra followed you, huh?
     
                         LILLY
               She must have been the one that
               blew me off with Bobo. I guess to
               get me running. Did you tell her
               about my stash?
     
                         ROY
                   (isn't worth discussing)
               No.
     
                         LILLY
               No, you wouldn't. That's what she
               was after, though. But why hit on
               me?
     
                         ROY 
               I wouldn't go in on a deal with
               her. She blamed you for it.
     
                         LILLY
                   (a shaky laugh)
               As though you do what I say.
     
                         ROY
                   (cold grin)
               That's pretty funny, all right.
               What happened in Phoenix?
     
     Remembered emotion makes Lilly talk in little fast clusters
     of words.
     
                         LILLY
               Roy, it was terrible. You read
               about people killing people and all
               that, but when it happens, my God.
     
     EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
     
     Myra, in nightgown, carrying the ice bucket, approaches Room
     131.
     
                         LILLY
               She was in her nightgown, you know,
               the old grifter's dodge, nightgown
               and the Ice bucket and she just got
               into the wrong room by mistake.
     
     INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
     
     CU, Lilly asleep. Very dim light. The shadows shift on her
     face as Myra OUT OF FRAME approaches. Myra's hands ENTER
     FRAME, abruptly clamp on Lilly's throat. Lilly's eyes pop
     open wide, staring, her mouth stretches open. Myra's arms are
     locked straight, pressing her weight down onto her hands
     squeezing Lilly's throat. Lilly clutches at Myra's fingers,
     tries to reach Myra's face, twists and squirms, then suddenly
     lifts her arm up and behind her head, hand dipping under the
     pillow, coming out with the silenced gun, pushing the gun
     upward, straight-arm, the gun moving up OUT OF FRAME. SOUND
     of shot. Blood sprays Lilly's face. Myra's body drops down
     onto her, at an angle, so we can still see Lilly's horrified
     face over Myra's shoulder as Lilly gasps for breath.
     
     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Lilly stares across the room, breathing hard, reliving the
     experience.
     
                         LILLY 
               I sat in there with her, I thought,
               what do I do now? Run and I've got
               Bobo and the law after me. Stay,
               and how do I explain?
     
                         ROY 
               This way's perfect.
     
     Lilly sits back, showing that relief again.
     
                         LILLY 
               It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a
               break for me after all.
               I've been wanting out of the racket
               for years, and now I'm out. I can
               make a clean start, and --
     
                         ROY 
               You've already made a start.
               Doesn't look that clean, though.
     
     Here's the awkwardness. Lilly looks guilty and embarrassed.
     
                         LILLY
               I'm sorry. I hated to take your
               money, but --
     
                         ROY
               Don't be sorry. You're not taking
               it.
     
     Lilly reacts as though he's slapped her. But then she gets
     her determination back. She splays out both hands, palm down,
     on the attache case on her lap.
     
                         LILLY
               I need this, Roy. I can't run
               without money, and if I can't run
               I'm dead.
     
                         ROY 
               You must have some money.
     
                         LILLY
               Just a few bucks.
     
                         ROY 
               And Myra's stuff?
     
                         LILLY
                   (scornful)
               Her credit cards. How far am I
               gonna get with that?
     
                         ROY 
               Far enough. Maybe up to San
               Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace
               new. Start over.
     
                         LILLY
               At what?
     
                         ROY 
               You're smart, Lilly, and you're
               good-looking. You won't have any
               trouble finding a job.
     
                         LILLY 
                   (appalled)
               A job? I've never had a legit job
               in my life!
     
                         ROY 
               Well, you're gonna start, if you
               hope to live through this. A square
               job and a quiet life. You start
               showing up at the track or the hot
               spots and Bobo's boys will be all
               over you.
     
                         LILLY
                   (exasperated)
               Roy, I know what to do with myself!
               It's a big world out there.
     
                         ROY 
               Not any more. Lilly, listen, I'm
               giving you good advice. I'm
               following it myself.
     
                         LILLY
                   (doesn't get it)
               What?
     
                         ROY 
               I thought it over, and you were
               right. You wanted me out of the
               rackets, and now --
     
                         LILLY
                   (bedeviled, aggravated)
               Roy, that's fine, but I don't have
               time for this. Bobo --
     
                         ROY
               I thought you'd be happy for me.
               After all, you --
     
                         LILLY 
               Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after
               me, and he's goddamn good! But so
               am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I
               survive.
     
                         ROY 
               I know you do, so that's why --
     
                         LILLY 
               And to survive, my way, I need
               money.
               Bobo knows about the stash in the
               car, so I didn't dare touch it, not
               if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that
               leaves this.
     
                         ROY
               No.
     
     Lilly sits back again, brooding at Roy, trying to think how
     to get to him, how to get through him or around him. She
     sighs, licks her lips.
     
                         LILLY
               You want a drink?
     
                         ROY 
               I don't think so. You probably
               shouldn't either.
     
                         LILLY 
               No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice
               water?
     
                         ROY
               Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
     
                         LILLY
               I'll get it.
     
     She stands, putting the attache case on the sofa next to
     where she was sitting. Roy, with a faint smile, watches her
     leave the room.
     
     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
     
     Very small, little used. Dark. Lilly switches on the light
     when she enters, then leans against the counter, fists
     clenched and trembling on the counter in front of her. She
     grits her teeth, hyperventilates, stares around the room in
     search of escape, an answer, something.
     
     CU, Lilly's face, desperate, grim, but not giving up.
     
     WIDE SHOT. Lilly opens cabinets, finds two glasses, opens the
     nearly-empty refrigerator, gets ice cubes from a tray, puts
     them in the glasses, puts the partial tray back in the
     freezer compartment, fills the glasses from the cold water
     tap, puts the glasses on the counter, stares at them briefly.
     She then shakes her head, searches the kitchen some more, and
     finds a cookie sheet she can use as a tray. She puts the
     glasses on the tray, carries the tray from the room, leaving
     the light on.
     
     INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Lilly enters with the tray, crosses to Roy, presents the
     glasses, speaks as he reaches for one.
     
                         LILLY 
               Take whichever one you want.
     
     He hesitates. It hadn't occurred to him Lilly might try to
     poison him or knock him out. He grins at her and takes a
     glass.
     
                         ROY 
               You wouldn't do that.
     
     Lilly takes the other glass, puts the cookie sheet on a
     table, looks down at Roy.
     
                         LILLY 
               You don't know what I'd do, Roy.
               You have no idea. To live.
     
                         ROY
                   (easy)
               Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
     
     Lilly crosses back to the sofa, sits beside the attache case,
     pats it absently as though it is a pet and she's glad it
     didn't move, waited for her. She sips water, puts the glass
     on the end table.
     
                         LILLY 
               I know what's bugging you, of
               course.
     
                         ROY 
               Oh? I didn't know anything was.
     
                         LILLY
                   (twisted grin)
               Oh, really? You've got a legitimate
               complaint, Roy, I don't deny that.
               I wasn't a very good mother when
               you were a kid.
     
                         ROY
                   (full laugh)
               Not very good!
     
     She nods, accepting the correction.
     
                         LILLY 
               A bad mother. By any standards.
               I've thought about it, you know,
               from your side, since then. I know
               just how bad I was.
     
                         ROY
                   (closed against her)
               Uh-huh.
     
                         LILLY 
               I wonder did you ever think about
               it from my side.
     
                         ROY
                   (not worth discussing)
               Never.
     
                         LILLY 
               No, I guess not. It was pretty
               lousy of me, I guess, to be a child
               at the same time you were. Not to
               stop being a child just because I
               had a child. I guess I was a real
               stinker not to be a grown-up when
               you needed a grown-up.
     
     Roy didn't expect to be made uncomfortable and defensive, and
     he resents it.
     
                         ROY 
               What do you want me to do? Pin a
               halo on you? You're doing a pretty
               good job of that yourself.
     
                         LILLY 
               And making you feel bad at the same
               time, huh? But that's the way I am,
               you know, the way I've always been.
               Always picking on poor little Roy.
     
                         ROY 
               For God's sake, Lilly!
     
                         LILLY
                   (intense)
               I gave you your life twice. I'm
               asking you to give me mine once. I
               need the money.
     
                         ROY
                   (not worth discussing)
               No.
     
     Lilly subsides back onto the sofa. One hand rests on the
     attache case. With the other, she sips water, puts the glass
     back down. Roy watches her, unmoving, expressionless. Lilly
     frowns, not quite looking at him.
     
                         LILLY
               You're getting off the grift?
     
                         ROY 
               That's right.
     
                         LILLY
               That's good. You don't really
               belong on this side of the fence,
               you know.
     
                         ROY 
                   (amused)
               I don't?
     
                         LILLY
               If you stayed a crook, do you think
               you'd live to be my ripe age?
     
                         ROY 
               I don't see why not.
     
                         LILLY
               Well, I guess I got it wrong, then.
               Seems to me I heard about a guy
               just your age that got hit so hard
               in the guts it almost killed him.
     
     Roy's again unexpectedly uncomfortable. He shifts uneasily in
     his chair, trying to think of a response.
     
                         ROY 
               Well, uh...
     
                         LILLY
               Sure, sure, that doesn't count.
               That's different.
     
                         ROY
               Well, it doesn't matter, does it?
               I'm getting out.
     
                         LILLY
                   (intense)
               And that's why you've got to get
               rid of this money. If you keep it
               around, it'll just make you think
               how clever you are.
               It'll be a temptation to get back
               into the game.
     
                         ROY
                   (full laugh)
               Oh, that's it! You're stealing my
               money for my own good! How very
               motherly of you, Lilly.
     
     Once again, Lilly drops back against the sofa back. Another
     round in the fight is over. Roy watches her, patient, waiting
     for her to give up, seeing no other outcome.
     
     AN ANGLE on Lilly, frustrated, feeling the need to move, the
     pressure of pursuit. Her head turns back and forth, her body
     starts false gestures. Finally, abruptly, she gets to her
     feet, looks at Roy, looks away, picks up the attache case.
     
     CU, Roy, alert. He won't let her reach the door.
     
     AN ANGLE PANNING with Lilly as she prowls the room, pacing
     back and forth, the attache case swinging at her side.
     Finally, she stops, standing the attache case on the coffee
     table, her hand still on its handle.
     
                         ROY 
               Lilly.
     
     She looks at him, attentive without hope.
     
                         ROY 
               If I should get out of the racket,
               that goes double for you. That's
               why you've got to change your life
               completely, go to some town, get a
               square job, live like a john
               yourself. If you try to do it your
               way, what future is in it?
     
                         LILLY 
               A future. The only future I've got.
     
                         ROY 
               That money wouldn't last forever.
               And then what? You'd be back in
               some other part of the rackets.
               Another Bobo Justus to slap you
               around and burn holes in your
               hands. This way, you've got to go
               the square route. You could send me
               a card when you're settled, I could
               maybe help out sometimes...
     
                         LILLY
                   (bitter laugh) )
               That's what it is, isn't it? Keep
               me down. Your turn to be in charge,
               have the power.
     
                         ROY
                   (stonewalling)
               Just trying to help, Lilly.
     
     She sits on the sofa again, this time leaving the attache
     case to stand on the coffee table. She studies Roy,
     calculating.
     
                         LILLY 
               Roy... What if I told you I wasn't
               really your mother? That we weren't
               related?
     
                         ROY
                   (bewildered)
               What?
     
     Lilly leans back again, but this time her manner is
     different; languorous, sexy. She crosses her legs, the upper
     leg swinging gently. She smiles gently, encouragingly, at
     Roy.
     
                         LILLY 
               You'd like that, wouldn't you? Sure
               you would. You don't need to tell
               me. Now, why would you like it,
               Roy?
     
     AN ANGLE on Roy, understanding and not wanting to understand.
     
                         ROY
                   (hoarse)
               What's that all about? Of course
               you're my mother. Of course you
               are.
     
     TWO SHOT. Lilly leans forward toward Roy, inviting him.
     
                         LILLY
                   (very soft)
               Roy... Roy
     
     Roy will not let anything complicated come to the surface.
     
                         ROY 
               There's nothing more to talk about.
     
                         LILLY
                   (very soft)
               I have to have that money, Roy.
               What do I have to do to get it?
     
     AN ANGLE on Roy, his face bruised-looking, eyes scared. He
     will not know what's going on. He shakes his head, not
     trusting himself to speak.
     
     AN ANGLE on Lilly, leaning forward, tension showing through
     the seductive manner.
     
                         LILLY 
               No? Won't you give me the money,
               Roy? Can't I change your mind? What
               can I do to change your mind?
     
     TWO SHOT, as Lilly gets to her feet and takes a step toward
     him. Roy's pressed back into his chair, trying to maintain a
     cold facade.
     
                         ROY 
               Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
     
                         LILLY
               Is there nothing I can do, Roy,
               nothing at --
     
                         ROY 
               NO!
     
     They both turn away at the same instant. Roy turns to the
     side to pick up the glass of water, to break the spell and
     the tension. Lilly turns back toward the coffee table and
     picks up the attache case. Roy, lifting the glass to drink,
     turns forward again as Lilly spins forward, swinging the
     attache case at his head with all her might. The case crashes
     into the glass and into his face. Roy SCREAMS and topples off
     the chair, as the one remaining clasp on the case lets go and
     money goes flying, filling the air.
     
     AN ANGLE DOWN at Roy, face up, expression horrified, hands to
     his throat. A large triangle of glass is in his throat. Blood
     pumps thickly, fountaining up.
     
     CU, Lilly, staring down in horror. She lurches forward, but
     there's nothing to do. She stares around.
     
     ECU, wads of bills on the floor, getting bloody.
     
     CU, Lilly, in agony, but looking down, kicking.
     
     ECU, Lilly's feet kicking the bills away from the blood. 
     
     TWO SHOT, as Lilly drops to her knees beside Roy, who's
     already dying. Blood spurts less forcefully. His hands fall
     to his sides, eyes stare upward, mouth still moves slightly.
     Lilly, shoving money away with her hands now, stares at him,
     willing it not to happen. He stops moving. His eyes dull.
     Lilly clasps her arms around herself. She knows she doesn't
     dare scream. Lips drawn back in a snarl, teeth clenched, she
     HISSES her agony through her teeth. She HISSES; she HISSES;
     she HISSES. Then, slowly, she regains control.
     
     WIDE SHOT as Lilly gets to her feet. She seems dazed now,
     like someone who's just been in a traffic accident. She
     blunders around the room, kicks the attache case, bends to
     pick it up. She studies the clasp, sees it still works, goes
     back to her knees.
     
     LOW ANGLE, Lilly in f.g., Roy in b.g., as Lilly repacks the
     money into the case, wiping the blood from some wads onto the
     carpet. Finishing, she closes the case, then remains on her
     knees, bending over the case. She WEEPS grindingly.
     
     WIDE SHOT, entrance door in b.g. Lilly's weeping subsides.
     She gets wearily to her feet, and leaves the room. CAMERA
     HOLDS. SOUND of water running in sink. SOUND STOPS. Lilly
     reappears. She does not again look toward Roy. She picks up
     the attache case, crosses to the door, opens it, steps across
     the threshold, reaches back to switch off the light. GO TO
     BLACK.
     
                               THE END
