               FADE IN:

               Inside a closet.

               It is a large closet with double doors, a crisp line of light 
               cutting down through the center of the darkness.

               As we begin to descend, voices echo in our head.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         I had this image of you, inside of 
                         me, like a part of me.

               We move past a shelf filled with hatboxes and handbags.  It 
               is a woman's closet.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         You planned this whole thing, didn't 
                         you?

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         Where's the fucking money?

               We glide over the tightly packed hangers, close enough to 
               feel the different fabrics and descend past the dresses to 
               the racks of high heels.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         We make our own choices, we pay our 
                         own prices.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         All part of the business.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         All part of the business.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         What choice?

               We slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel and 
               reach the bottom of the closet, where we find a pair of black 
               Dr. Martens boots that are tied together with a white rope.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         I want out.

               We move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is bound, 
               lying motionless on the floor of the closet, the rope coiling 
               tightly around her wrists.

               The crack at the bottom of the door lights her face.  She is 
               gagged and unconscious, a trickle of blood running down her 
               forehead.  Her name is CORKY.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         Like a part of me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.  ELEVATOR - DAY

               Leaning against the back of the elevator is Corky, a very 
               butch-looking woman with short hair and a black leather 
               jacket.  She is a lesbian and wants people to know it.

               As the doors begin to slide shut, a woman yells.

                                     WOMAN
                         Wait!  Hold the elevator.

               Corky pushes the "open" button.  A couple steps into the 
               elevator.  His name is CAESAR, a middle-aged Italian, wearing 
               an expensive suit and sunglasses.

               She is VIOLET; a piece of sexual candy that would melt in 
               your mouth.

               She hears it again, a guttural sound.

                                     CORKY
                         Thanks again for this opportunity, 
                         Mr. Bianchinni.  Goodbye.

               She hangs up the phone and walks toward the wall.

               As she gets closer, we hear a bed rocking, tapping against 
               the wall.

               The man's breathing grows more and more labored until finally 
               it swells --

                                                           DISSOLVING INTO:

               INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

               The whining motor of a high-powered drain-rod.

               The spiral cable whips wildly, spiraling deeper into the tub 
               drain, black goo splattering everywhere.

               The machine is so loud Corky almost cannot hear someone 
               pounding on the apartment door.

               Killing the motor, she stands and goes to the door.

               Behind the door is Violet, wearing jeans, a white T-shirt 
               and cowboy boots.

                                     VIOLET
                         Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of 
                         met in the elevator --

                                     CORKY
                         Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.

                                     VIOLET
                         I heard you working in here and I 
                         just wondered if you'd like a cup of 
                         coffee?

               She is holding two cups of coffee: one black, one with cream.

                                     CORKY
                         Sure.  Come on in.  Give me a minute.

               Violet steps inside as Corky goes back to the bathroom to 
               wash off the drain dreck.

                                     VIOLET
                         What happened to Rajeev?

               Corky calls from the bathroom, scrubbing her hands vigorously.

                                     CORKY
                         Who?

                                     VIOLET
                         Rajeev, the man who usually works on 
                         the building.

                                     CORKY
                         Oh, he went home to India, but as 
                         far as I know he'll be back.

               She wipes her hands on her overalls, returning to the main 
               room.

                                     VIOLET
                         So this is temporary for you?

                                     CORKY
                         Pretty much.  One day at a time.

               Violet hands her the cup of black coffee.

                                     VIOLET
                         I guessed you were straight black.

                                     CORKY
                         Good guess.

               They both sip from the piping hot mugs.

                                     CORKY
                         Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.

                                     VIOLET
                         My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I 
                         did have a slightly ulterior motive 
                         here.  I was wondering if I could 
                         ask a small favor?

                                     CORKY
                         A favor?

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, 
                         so I was wondering if it wasn't a 
                         terrible inconvenience if you could 
                         wait a bit before using power tools.

                                     CORKY
                         Oh, I'm sorry --

                                     VIOLET
                         No, it isn't your fault.  The walls 
                         here are just so thin.

                                     CORKY
                         Are they really?

                                     VIOLET
                         Yes, it really causes problems.  
                         Sometimes it's like you're in the 
                         same room.  But if it's too much 
                         trouble, I understand ...

                                     CORKY
                         No, no trouble.  There's other work 
                         to do.

                                     VIOLET
                         You're doing everything yourself?

                                     CORKY
                         Yeah.

                                     VIOLET
                         That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of 
                         people who can fix things.  My dad 
                         was like that.  We never had anything 
                         new.  Whenever something broke he 
                         would open it up, tinker with it and 
                         it would work.  His hands were magic.

               She looks at Corky's hands cupped around the mug.

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah ...  I bet your car is twenty 
                         years old.

               Corky smiles.

                                     CORKY
                         Truck.

                                     VIOLET
                         Truck.  Of course.

                                     CORKY
                         '63 Chevy.

                                     VIOLET
                         I knew it.

               VIOLET SIPS

                                     VIOLET
                         So, how do you know the owner, Mr. 
                         Bianchinni?

                                     CORKY
                         I don't, really.  I was referred to 
                         him.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh, really.

               Corky suddenly feels she has revealed something.

                                     CORKY
                         Do you know him?

                                     VIOLET
                         No, but Caesar does.  He likes him.  
                         Says he's a good Italian.

                                     CORKY
                         Caesar is your husband?

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying 
                         kind.

               Smiling, she says nothing else.

                                     VIOLET
                         I should be going.  You can drop the 
                         cup off anytime.

                                     CORKY
                         Thanks.

                                     VIOLET
                         My pleasure.

               CORKY watches her leave.

               EXT.  THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT

               A dirty bar hidden away on a dark street, its cracked, moon-
               white sign the only evidence it exists.

               Corky's truck swings into a space in front of a couple of 
               large motorcycles.  She flips her collar and heads for the 
               door.

               INT.  THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT

               The smell of leather and cigarette smoke fills Corky's nose 
               as she crosses to the bar.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Well, well ...

               Corky sits as the fat bartender waddles over.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Been awhile, Cork.

                                     CORKY
                         Five years, two months, sixteen days.  
                         How you doing, Sue?

               Corky puts a cigarette in her mouth and lights it.

                                     SUE
                         Like shit.  Now that we're all caught 
                         up, how about a drink?

               Sue opens the refrigerator and pulls out two Old Styles.

                                     CORKY
                         Thanks.

               They click the bottles together and drink.

                                     SUE
                         You got a job yet?

                                     CORKY
                         Yeah.  Some plumbing, painting and 
                         shit.

               Sue laughs.

                                     SUE
                         I mean a J-O-B.  A real job.

                                     CORKY
                         Not for me, Sue.  I'm straight and 
                         narrow.  I'm just here to get laid 
                         or drunk and hopefully both.

               Corky gets off the stool.

                                     CORKY
                         Thanks for the beer.

               Looking around, she sees a woman alone at one of the back 
               tables.  Through the smoky din, she bears a slight resemblance 
               to Violet.

               The woman is dressed all in black, including a leather jacket.

               Smiling, Corky slides into the chair beside her.  There is 
               no one smoother.

                                     CORKY
                         Hi.

                                     WOMAN
                         Hello.

                                     CORKY
                         You know ...  that outfit would look 
                         great on my bedroom floor.

               The woman smiles just as someone taps Corky on the shoulder.

               She turns and is face-to-face with a large bull of a woman 
               in a heavy leather Chicago Police jacket.  She is more wide 
               than fat.

                                     WOMAN COP
                         Hey, Jesse.  What's happening here?

                                     CORKY
                         Nothing ...  yet.

                                     WOMAN COP
                         Who's this?

               Her coat opens as she puts her hands on her hips.  A service 
               revolver is clipped to her belt.

               She squints at Corky, her head nodding in recognition.

                                     WOMAN COP
                         Wait, I know you.

                                     CORKY
                         I don't think so.

                                     WOMAN COP
                         I didn't know you were out.

               Corky smiles at the woman in black.

                                     CORKY
                         When you get tired of Cagney and 
                         Lacey, come find me.

               She heads for the exit.

               EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT 

               The neighborhood would be politely described as "rough." 
               Corky's truck does not stand out parked alone on the littered 
               street.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               It is a hole but it is home.

               Corky is lying on her futon staring up at the ceiling, a 
               beer resting on her stomach; a folk singer quietly croons 
               from the radio.

               We see the ceiling, a circle of light hovering over the small 
               desk lamp.  We move in on the spot, which slowly fills up 
               the screen until there is nothing but the white light.

               Suddenly a wet paint roller loaded with white paint cuts a 
               swath across the ceiling.

               MATCH CUT TO:

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY  

               Corky is painting the ceiling.  The folk ballad has become 
               an angry Riot Grrrl anthem.

               She is working hard, the roller sucking back and forth.  
               Sweat covers her face.

               Dropping the roller down, she reloads it in the tray when 
               the phone rings.  She stops and answers it.

                                     CORKY
                         Hello?  Oh, hi, Mr. Bianchinni ...  
                         yes, everything is going fine.  I 
                         got the tub drain all cleaned out.

               She listens for a moment.

                                     CORKY
                         What apartment?

               She glances at the main wall.

                                     CORKY
                         All right, all right, I guess I could 
                         take a look.  Yeah, you're welcome, 
                         goodbye.

               She hangs up and looks again at the wall, feeling...  curious.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               Corky knocks and after a moment Violet opens the door.  She 
               seems surprised.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would 
                         call you.  God, you must think |I'm 
                         a total nuisance.

                                     CORKY
                         Not exactly.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm sorry, I usually would call 
                         Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do 
                         so I called Mr. Bianchinni.

                                     CORKY
                         He said you lost something.

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah, come on in.

               She steps back and Corky walks inside.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Violet leads her through the apartment.  It is expensively 
               furnished with very masculine tastes; a lot of gray and black 
               leather.

                                     VIOLET
                         I was doing some dishes and just as 
                         I pulled the stopper my earring fell 
                         in.

               Corky looks at her blankly.

                                     VIOLET
                         It's one of my favorites.  That's 
                         why I got upset.  I know it probably 
                         seems ridiculous to you.

               An eyebrow goes up.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I 
                         shouldn't have called...

                                     CORKY
                         I told Bianchinni I would take a 
                         look.  Is it that sink?

               Violet nods.

               She opens the sink cabinet and pulls out a pair of channel 
               locks from her back pocket.  The teeth of the channel locks 
               open and bite onto the pressure nut.

                                     CORKY
                         Do you have a pot or a bucket?

                                     VIOLET
                         Sure.

               She hands one down to her.  Corky slides it under the curved 
               pipe.

               As she works, Corky feels herself staring at Violet, at the 
               hem of her dress curving tightly around her thighs.

               Water begins to trickle into the pan.

               The nut slides loose and Corky tips the trap.  Water splashes 
               into the pan with a soft metal "tink."

                                     VIOLET
                         Did you find it?

               Corky fishes into gray water and pulls out the earring.

               Violet screams, a huge smile on her face, half-falling as 
               she tries to hug Corky.

                                     VIOLET
                         I can't believe it!  You did it!

               Corky leans back under and replaces the trap.

                                     VIOLET
                         Thank you so much.  You have to let 
                         me pay you something --

                                     CORKY
                         No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do 
                         it.  I did it.

               Corky checks the drain by running the water.

                                     VIOLET
                         If you won't take money, how about a 
                         drink?  It's getting late.  You can't 
                         work all night.

               Corky eyes her for a moment.

                                     CORKY
                         Okay, one drink.

                                     VIOLET
                         What do you want?

                                     CORKY
                         A beer?

                                     VIOLET
                         A beer.  Of course.

               She smiles and turns to the bar.

                                     VIOLET
                         Sit down.

               Corky sits on the black leather couch and Violet returns 
               with two bottles of Heineken.  Corky sneers.

                                     VIOLET
                         Thanks again.

               They clink the bottles and swig.

                                     VIOLET
                         You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make 
                         you nervous, Corky?

                                     CORKY
                         No.

               She looks at Violet, then takes another long pull on the 
               bottle.

                                     VIOLET
                         Thirsty, maybe.

               Violet smiles, her eyes again talking for her.

                                     CORKY
                         Curious, maybe.

                                     VIOLET
                         Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling 
                         a bit curious myself right now.

               Violet notices the tattoo on Corky's arm.

                                     VIOLET
                         That's a great tattoo.

               She reaches over and touches it.

                                     VIOLET
                         Beautiful labrys.

               Corky is a bit suprised that she knows what it is.  She nods, 
               rubbing it as if trying to hide it.

                                     VIOLET
                         Are you surprised that I know what 
                         it is?

                                     CORKY
                         Maybe.

                                     VIOLET
                         I have a tattoo, would you like to 
                         see it?

               She moves closer, sliding over the leather cushions as she 
               opens the front of her dress.

                                     VIOLET
                         A woman in upstate New York did it 
                         for me.

               She is not wearing a bra.

                                     VIOLET
                         Here.  Do you like it?

               Set against the soft white skin of her breast is a bright 
               green-stemmed violet.

                                     VIOLET
                         It took her all day to do it.  She 
                         promised me it wouldn't hurt, but it 
                         was sore for a long time after.  I 
                         couldn't even touch it.

               Corky looks up from Violet's breast to her dark eyes.

                                     VIOLET
                         But now I love the way it feels.

               She runs her fingers softly over the slightly scarred skin.

                                     VIOLET
                         Here, touch it.

               Corky feels the blood pounding in her ears as Violet takes 
               her hand and places it on her breast.

                                     CORKY
                         What are you doing?

               Violet looks at her.

                                     VIOLET
                         Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to 
                         seduce you.

                                     CORKY
                         Why?

                                     VIOLET
                         Because I want to.  I've wanted to 
                         since I first saw you in the elevator.

               Corky watches her, trying to figure her out even as her thumb 
               presses into Violet's nipple.

               Inhaling sharply, Violet closes her eyes; she can feel Corky 
               staring at her.

                                     VIOLET
                         You don't believe me.  But I can 
                         prove it to you.

               She takes Corky's wrist and begins pulling her hand down her 
               body.

                                     VIOLET
                         You can't believe me because of what 
                         you see ...

               She forces Corky's hand between her legs, up under her dress.

                                     VIOLET
                         But you can believe what you feel.

               Violet opens her eyes, a wanton smile on her lips.

                                     VIOLET
                         You see ...  I've been thinking about 
                         you all day.

               Corky's forearm flexes and Violet moans.

               With both hands, Violet takes hold of Corky's forearm.

                                     CORKY
                         You planned this whole thing?

               Violet's head swims; she is unable to breathe.

                                     CORKY
                         You dropped that earring down the 
                         drain on purpose, didn't you?

                                     VIOLET
                         If I say yes, will you take your 
                         hand away?

                                     CORKY
                         No.

                                     VIOLET
                         ...  yes.

               Now it is Corky who smiles.

               Violet shivers, her thighs rubbing, her hips thrusting against 
               Corky's hand.

                                     VIOLET
                         Please, Corky ...  please ...

               Her eyes barely open.

                                     VIOLET
                         ...  kiss me.

               In a single motion, Corky takes hold of the back of her neck 
               and covers Violet's open mouth with her own.

               With her hand still stuffed between Violet's legs, Corky 
               lays her back onto the couch as the kiss becomes more --

               More desperate, more hungry until --

               We hear the front door unlock and open.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet?

               Violet's eyes pop open and she pushes Corky back.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet, you home?

               They scramble to compose themselves.

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah.  In here, C.

               He comes around the corner and in the dim light sees the two 
               figures sitting close on the couch.

                                     CAESAR
                         What's this?

               He mistakes Corky for a man.

                                     CAESAR
                         What the fuck is this?

               Violet stands as Caesar barrels toward the couch.

                                     VIOLET
                         I didn't expect --

                                     CAESAR
                         What the fuck is going on?

               Corky stands and turns, Caesar suddenly realizing that she 
               is a woman.

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh, shit ...

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ...  
                         it's fucking dark in here.

               He reaches to the wall for the lights.

                                     VIOLET
                         She is working for Bianchinni.

               Caesar extends his hand.

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh, right, right.  Don mentioned 
                         that to me.  Hi, welcome to the 
                         family.

               Corky shakes his hand.

                                     CAESAR
                         You're helping Rajeev?

                                     CORKY
                         No.  Rajeev's in India.

                                     VIOLET
                         She's doing the work herself.

                                     CAESAR
                         No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You 
                         know he's a good friend of mine.  
                         |Family, really.

                                     CORKY
                         That's what Violet said.

               He looks at her as if he knows something.

                                     CAESAR
                         So, you just got out?

                                     VIOLET
                         Jesus, Caesar!

                                     CAESAR
                         What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal.  
                         I know who Don hires.  Did you know 
                         he did time himself?

               Corky shakes her head.

                                     CAESAR
                         Thirteen fucking years.  See, there 
                         ain't no secrets here.

               Corky doesn't like this man.

                                     CAESAR
                         How many'd you do?

                                     CORKY
                         Five.

               He whistles.

                                     CAESAR
                         Not bad.  What for?

                                     VIOLET
                         That's none of your goddamn business, 
                         Caesar.

                                     CAESAR
                         You're right.  You don't have to 
                         tell me, if you don't want to.  I 
                         just hope you understand you're among 
                         good people here.

               He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick fold of 
               money and peels several hundreds.  Corky stares at it.

                                     CAESAR
                         Come on, come on.  if you understand 
                         what I'm talking about you're going 
                         to take the money.  if you don't, 
                         I'm going to have to worry about 
                         you.

               Corky takes it.  Caesar smiles.

                                     CAESAR
                         Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.

                                     CORKY
                         I should be going.

                                     CAESAR
                         What?  How about a drink?

                                     CORKY
                         My brushes, I have to clean my 
                         brushes.  Thanks, though.

                                     CAESAR
                         Another time.

                                     CORKY
                         Sure.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 

               Close on the paintbrush, Corky's fingers pushing through and 
               separating the black bristles under the running water.

               When the brush is clean, she flicks it dry and resets the 
               edge.

               She goes to the sink to wash her hands when she stops, 
               noticing her left hand.

               It is the hand that was between Violet's legs.

               She is about to smell her finger when she sees herself in 
               the mirror.

                                     CORKY
                         What are you doing?

               She drops her hand.

                                     CORKY
                         What am I doing?  I'm fucking up, 
                         that's what I'm doing.

               She scrubs her hands clean.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 

               It is late, the area burnished with amber street light.  
               Corky walks from the building to her truck.

               She climbs inside and slides the key into the ignition, when 
               suddenly the passenger door opens and --

               Violet gets in.  Stunned, Corky stares at her.

                                     VIOLET
                         I had to see you.

                                     CORKY
                         Look, I don't think this is a good 
                         idea.

                                     VIOLET
                         I wanted to apologize.

                                     CORKY
                         Don't apologize, please.  I can't 
                         stand women who apologize for wanting 
                         sex.

               Violet smiles.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm not apologizing for what I did --

               She slides across the seat.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm apologizing for what I didn't 
                         do.

               She kisses Corky, and if Corky is trying to resist, we can't 
               tell.

               The windshield is beginning to steam when Violet, panting, 
               breaks the kiss.

                                     VIOLET
                         Do you have a bed somewhere?

               Unable to speak, Corky reaches over and starts the engine.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The sex.

               There is nothing flower-scented or out-of-focus about it.

               It is sweaty, slippery, body-grinding, bed-squeaking lesbian 
               sex --

               Pungent and potent --

               And when it is over, neither woman can move.

               Finally, Corky's eyes flutter open.

                                     CORKY
                         I can see again.

               Violet smiles.

               Slowly, Corky gets up and goes to the fridge.  She grabs a 
               beer and presses it to her sweating forebead.

               After a moment, she lowers it, gently pressing the cold can 
               elsewhere.  Eyes closed, she lets out a long "Ahh."

               Violet hears the sizzle-pop of the beer as Corky returns to 
               the bed.

               She holds the beer to Violet's lips and tilts the can, 
               watching Violet's throat as she drinks.

               Violet's eyes open.

                                     VIOLET
                         ...  I needed that.

                                     CORKY
                         Tell me about it.

               Corky hands her the beer as Violet sits up a bit.

                                     CORKY
                         Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?

                                     VIOLET
                         You have to ask?

                                     CORKY
                         No.

                                     VIOLET
                         Funny, nobody calls it that anymore.  
                         Caesar calls it "The |Business."

                                     CORKY
                         How did you meet him?

                                     VIOLET
                         They took over a club I was working 
                         at.  Caesar started managing it.

                                     CORKY
                         He's a launderer?

                                     VIOLET
                         Basically.

                                     CORKY
                         How long have you been with him?

                                     VIOLET
                         Almost five years.

                                     CORKY
                         Five years is a long time.

                                     VIOLET
                         Yes, it is.

               Corky stares at her beer.  She knows what Violet is thinking.

                                     CORKY
                         The redistribution of wealth.

                                     VIOLET
                         What?

                                     CORKY
                         Isn't that what you wanted to know?  
                         What I did time for?

                                     VIOLET
                         The redistribution of wealth?

                                     CORKY
                         That's what I tell someone when I'm 
                         trying to get them in my bed.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm already in your bed.

                                     CORKY
                         My cellmate would say she did her 
                         time for getting caught.  She was 
                         always more honest than me.

               Corky sips her beer.

                                     CORKY
                         I started stealing when I was little.  
                         We were piss-poor, which is not an 
                         excuse, just a fact.

               It isn't like her to talk about this, especially with someone 
               she just met.

                                     CORKY
                         The first time I remember so vividly.  
                         A bunch of us kids were at Waxman's 
                         Drugstore, when Mr. Waxman, who was 
                         a mean old prick, always worrying 
                         about us robbing him, dropped a roll 
                         of quarters.

               We can almost hear the coins tinkling on the tile floor.

                                     CORKY
                         I can still hear that sound, those 
                         quarters, because right then something 
                         clicked inside of me.  Some instinct 
                         took over and as everyone, including 
                         Waxman, dove down, I reached up and 
                         emptied the cash register.

               Violet smiles.  She likes this woman.

                                     CORKY
                         I gave most of the money to my mom.  
                         I told her I found it at the 
                         trainyard.  She was so happy she 
                         cried, calling me her lucky charm.  
                         Fifteen years later, I guess my luck 
                         ran out.

               Sbe swallows that with beer.

                                     CORKY
                         Sometimes I tell myself that I didn't 
                         have a choice, that stealing was 
                         surviving.  Usually I can admit that's 
                         bullshit.  I did it because it was a 
                         way out.  It was easy and I was good 
                         at it, real good.

               She glances at Violet.

                                     CORKY
                         I don't usually talk this much.  I 
                         guess I have been rehabilitated.

               Violet laughs.

                                     VIOLET
                         You didn't have to tell me if you 
                         didn't want to.

                                     CORKY
                         I guess I wanted to.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm glad you did.

                                     CORKY
                         So am I.

               EXT. PARKING LOT DAY 

               Corky gets out of her truck carrying her tools.  Grinning 
               like someone who has been well-laid, she whistles off to 
               work.

               EXT. LOBBY - DAY 

               Between the main doors she sees a man.  His name is SHELLY 
               and he is an overdressed accountant.

               He is very nervous, talking to someone through the intercom.

                                     SHELLY
                         I know he's gone.  Please.  I have 
                         to talk to you.

               Fiddling with her keys, Corky recognizes the voice that 
               answers him.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         What do you want, Shelly?

               Shelly glances over his shoulder at Corky, answering in a 
               hushed voice.

               SHELLY

               I have to leave.  Tonight.

               For a moment the intercom is silent.  Then the door buzzes 
               and Shelly pushes inside.  Corky follows him to the elevator.

               INT.  ELEVATOR - DAY

               Corky glares at Shelly and begins pumping the trigger of her 
               circular saw.

               Shelly hides behind his sunglasses, watching the elevator 
               numbers go up.  The doors open and he scurries out.

               INT.  HALL - DAY

               She watches him enter Caesar's apartment, her smile now 
               completely gone.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY

               It is later.  Through the wall we listen to the same sound 
               as before of two people making love.  We drop down and find 
               Corky's brush, still wet with paint, abandoned in her tray.

               INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

               Her face glistening with sweat, Violet climaxes, letting the 
               orgasm spread through her like melting butter.

                                     VIOLET
                         I had this image of you, inside of 
                         me ...

               She flattens her palms against the soft cradle of her pelvis.

                                     VIOLET
                         Like a part of me ...

               As she opens her eyes, we see that her lover is Corky.  Violet 
               watches as she gets off the bed and begins to get dressed.

                                     VIOLET
                         You are so beautiful.

               Corky does not answer as she yanks her pants on.  Violet 
               sits up.  She can feel that something is wrong.

                                     VIOLET
                         What's wrong?

                                     CORKY
                         Nothing.

               Violet pulls the sheet around her.

                                     VIOLET
                         Yes there is.  I felt it this morning 
                         when I brought you the coffee.

                                     CORKY
                         Shit, here we go.

                                     VIOLET
                         You didn't want to see me, did you?

                                     CORKY
                         If there is one thing I can't stand 
                         about sleeping with women, it's all 
                         the fucking mind reading.

                                     VIOLET
                         What are you afraid of?

                                     CORKY
                         I'm not afraid of anything.

                                     VIOLET
                         I don't understand - ?

                                     CORKY
                         I know!  You can't understand, because 
                         we're different, Violet.  We're 
                         different.

                                     VIOLET
                         We're not that different, Corky.

                                     CORKY
                         How can you sit in that bed and say 
                         that?

                                     VIOLET
                         Because it's the truth.

                                     CORKY
                         Let me guess.  This is where you 
                         tell me that what matters is on the 
                         inside.  That inside you, there is a 
                         little dyke just like me?

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's 
                         a lot smarter than you.

                                     CORKY
                         Is that what her daddy tells her?

                                     VIOLET
                         I know what I am.  I don't need to 
                         have it tattooed on my shoulder.

                                     CORKY
                         What are you saying?  That you don't 
                         have sex with men?

                                     VIOLET
                         I don't.

                                     CORKY
                         For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard 
                         you!  Thin walls, remember?

                                     VIOLET
                         What you heard wasn't sex.

                                     CORKY
                         What the fuck was it?

                                     VIOLET
                         All my life, everyone has been telling 
                         me that when I have sex, I'm not 
                         really having sex.  Not real sex.  
                         But they're wrong.  I know what is 
                         and isn't sex and what you heard was 
                         definitely not sex.

                                     CORKY
                         What was it then?

                                     VIOLET
                         Work.

               That knocks Corky back.

                                     VIOLET
                         You made certain choices in your 
                         life that you paid for.  You said 
                         you made them because you were good 
                         at something and it was easy.  Do 
                         you think you're the only one that's 
                         good at something?

               Violet stare pins Corky to the wall.

                                     VIOLET
                         We make our own choices and we pay 
                         our own prices.  I think we're more 
                         alike than you want to admit.

                                     CORKY
                         What about that guy this morning?

                                     VIOLET
                         You mean Shelly?

                                     CORKY
                         Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.

                                     VIOLET
                         No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw 
                         me in a bar with another woman.

                                     CORKY
                         I suppose he just wants to watch.

               That's all Violet can take.

                                     VIOLET
                         Fuck it!  I think you better leave.

                                     CORKY
                         I think so, too.

               Violet turns away.

                                     VIOLET
                         Try not to steal anything on the way 
                         out.

               That stings but Corky walks out without looking back.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               It is dark now.  Corky is standing above the paint tray that 
               has skinned over.  She picks up the brush.  It is dry with 
               paint.

                                     CORKY
                         Shit.

               She throws the brush across the room.

               EXT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               A green-and-white street sign juts in the foreground of 
               Caesar's upscale apartment building.

               The sign reads: "FRANKLIN STREET."

               EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY

               The rusty Chevy glides to a stop in a parking space near the 
               service entrance.  In its payload is a boxed bathroom vanity 
               and sink.

               Corky climbs out of the cab and into the back, unhooking the 
               bungee cords that hold down the boxes.

               She looks up as a black Lincoln Town Car screeches into a 
               spot not far from her truck.  THREE SERIOUS-LOOKING MEN get 
               out, leading a fourth, Shelly.

               He is the only one who seems to notice Corky.

               They enter the building, the door closing behind them.

               INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

               Corky's legs jut out from the old wicker vanity as she 
               finishes detaching its anchors and pipe work.

               She stands, giving it a yank and pulling it away from the 
               wall, when voices begin to filter in from the next-door 
               apartment.

               She listens - a rising string of warbling sobs drowned out 
               by an angry voice.

                                     ANGRY VOICE
                         Shut the fuck up!  You piece of shit!

               We hear a scream.

                                     ANGRY VOICE
                         You're going to tell us!  You're 
                         going to fuckin' tell us!  just a 
                         matter of fuckin' time!

               Each sentence is punctuated with grunts and thuds.

                                     ANGRY VOICE
                         Where is it?  Where the fuck is it?!

               We begin to close in on Corky as she listens to each thud, 
               watching something that disturbs her.

                                     ANGRY VOICE
                         You shit!  You piece of shit!

               With each thud the water in the toilet shimmers like a struck 
               cymbal.  As we move closer, the sound swells until --

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               INT.  CAESAR'S BATHROOM DAY

               Where blood splatters the toilet, heavy drops hitting the 
               water and spreading like inverted mushroom clouds.

                                     ANGRY VOICE
                         Did that hurt?  News flash, fucko: 
                         I'm just getting started.

               The angry voice belongs to JOHNNIE MARZZONE.  Shelly is 
               kneeling in front of the toilet, hands tied behind his back 
               with electrical wire.

               Johnnie Marzzone is a flashy young man in Armani slacks, 
               silk shirt and silver-tipped cowboy boots.  His tie is tucked 
               in, as if torture were a fine-dining experience.

               Caesar and two other men are crammed in the small bathroom.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         You got nerve trying to fuck us!  
                         Nobody fucks me!  Nobody fucks my 
                         father!  Nobody!  Nobody!

               Shelly screams as Jobnnie repeatedly rams his face into the 
               toilet.

                                     CAESAR
                         Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making 
                         too much noise.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!

                                     CAESAR
                         Here, put this in his mouth.

               Caesar hands a towel to Johnnie, who stuffs it into Shelly's 
               mouth.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Like Corky, Violet can hear the beating.  She is trying to 
               block it out but cannot.

               Standing at the bar, she runs the blender, grinding ice cubes, 
               trying to drown out the sounds of the bathroom.

               The bathroom door opens.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Prick!  I can go all night!  All 
                         night!

               Caesar steps out, shutting the door, masking the sounds behind 
               him.  Violet moves toward him.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, I'm leaving.

                                     CAESAR
                         What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one 
                         of the good towels.

               The door opens again as someone else steps out.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too 
                         much.  I have to get out of here.

                                     CAESAR
                         Why?  'Cause you know him?

               She nods.

                                     CAESAR
                         You women are so fucking sensitive.

               He takes hold of her.

                                     CAESAR
                         But I don't want you to go.  I like 
                         you here.  You know this isn't easy 
                         for me, either.

               He embraces her.  Over his shoulder she sees MICKEY MALNANO 
               in the hallway, staring at her.

               He is an older man, hair graying, built like a fireplug.  
               Sinewy mass strains at his Brooks Brothers suit.

                                     CAESAR
                         Now why don't you go watch some TV 
                         or something?

                                     MICKEY
                         Are you okay, Violet?

                                     CAESAR
                         Mickey, why is Johnnie here?  You 
                         know how I feel about that fucking 
                         psycho.

               Mickey continues to stare at Violet, who looks up at him 
               with her big doe eyes.

                                     MICKEY
                         Caesar, didn't I tell you to get 
                         something?

                                     CAESAR
                         Sure, Mickey.  Sure.

               He goes to the kitchen.

               Mickey moves closer to Violet, lifting her chin the way a 
               father would do to his little girl.

                                     MICKEY
                         You shouldn't have to see this.  Why 
                         don't you get out of here?  Go for a 
                         walk.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar wants me to stay.

                                     MICKEY
                         Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle 
                         Caesar.  You just get out of here, 
                         okay?

               She smiles.

                                     VIOLET
                         Thanks, Mickey.

               Caesar returns from the kitchen.  He is holding a pair of 
               tin snips.  Mickey takes them.

                                     MICKEY
                         Thanks, C.  Now let's end this thing.

               Violet watches them return to the bathroom.

               INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

               Mickey takes off his coat and hands it to a large man named 
               LOU.  He slaps Johnnie on the back.

                                     MICKEY
                         Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay.

               Johnnie hits Shelly once more.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Prick.

               Johnnie checks his hair in the mirror, carefully.  Then he 
               begins putting on the rings he had removed for the beating.

               Mickey kneels down next to Shelly's ear and motions to Lou, 
               who lifts Shelly's bound arms.

                                     MICKEY
                         Shelly, I'm going to ask you ten 
                         times.  You understand?  Ten times.

               Mickey grabs Shelly's pinky finger, putting it between the 
               metal blades.

                                     MICKEY
                         One.  Where is our money?

               Shelly whimpers, red-faced and sobbing.  There is a sick 
               crunch and Shelly howls into his gag as his pinky finger 
               bounces to the floor amid the expensive leather footwear.

                                     CAESAR
                         Aw ...  Christ.

               We hear Caesar retrieve a tissue and his hand enters the 
               frame, scooping up the pinky.

               He plunks the severed finger into the toilet and it sinks to 
               the bottom.

               Caesar drops the toilet seat down and flushes.

               INT.  BATHROOM - EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY

               Corky can't stand it anymore.  She throws her tools down, 
               leaves the bathroom and finds --

               Violet waiting in the main room.  Both women stand apart in 
               silence.

               Violet seems on the verge of saying something but doesn't 
               know how to start.  Her lip begins to quiver; her eyes search 
               the room, returning to Corky each time.

               The violence in the next room can still be heard.

                                     CORKY
                         Violet?  Are you all right?

               Almost unnoticeably, Violet shakes her bead.  Corky puts her 
               arm around her.

                                     CORKY
                         Come on.  Let's go.

               INT.  BAR - DAY

               It is the kind of bar businessmen drink at in the afternoon.  
               Dark wood and padded leather.

               The bartender, joking with a cluster of men, does not notice 
               Corky as she moves up to the bar.

                                     CORKY
                         Excuse me.

               The bartender glances over.

                                     CORKY
                         Draft beer and a TNT.

               Corky eyes the men, who stare into their drinks.

               The bartender says nothing as he puts the drinks in front of 
               her.

               Corky heads for her table, ignoring the whispers and snickers.

               Corky and Violet, the only women in the room, sit close 
               together at a far corner table.

               Violet's voice is hushed.

                                     VIOLET
                         Shelly was skimming from the business.  
                         He came to see me yesterday because 
                         he was afraid Caesar figured it out.  
                         He wanted to run but he wanted me to 
                         come with him.

                                     CORKY
                         Even though he knew about you?

                                     VIOLET
                         Yes.

                                     CORKY
                         He was in love with you, right?

                                     VIOLET
                         That's what he told himself.  But it 
                         wasn't even about me, it was about 
                         Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had.  
                         That's how they are.  I understand 
                         them.

               She glances around the room; a man at the bar smiles at her.

                                     VIOLET
                         For Shelly, taking the money was a 
                         way to take from Caesar.  He could 
                         have run at any time, but he didn't 
                         because he didn't want out.

                                     CORKY
                         Sounds like he wanted to get caught.

                                     VIOLET
                         Maybe he did.  He would brag to me 
                         all the time.  He was never afraid 
                         of Caesar because he didn't know 
                         him.  Not like I do.

               Two men sit down near them, laughing.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar lives for these moments.  He 
                         tells me it's just the business, but 
                         I know it's more than that.  He likes 
                         it.  The violence.  I'll catch him 
                         in the bathroom mirror touching his 
                         scars.  He says they remind him who 
                         he his.  They're all like that.  
                         Except maybe Mickey.

                                     CORKY
                         Mickey?

                                     VIOLET
                         He's the part of the business that 
                         the rest of them pretend to be.  
                         |But Mickey doesn't like it like 
                         they do.  I suppose that's why he's 
                         good at it.

               Violet stares at her glass, at the melting ice.

                                     VIOLET
                         I used to be able to block it out.  
                         I would tell myself that I wasn't 
                         really there so nothing really 
                         mattered.  But I can't do it anymore.

               She downs the last of her drink.

                                     VIOLET
                         I've been making the same mistake 
                         Shelly made.  But now I know what |I 
                         want.

               She turns to Corky.

                                     VIOLET
                         I want out.  I want a new life.  I 
                         see what I've been waiting for, but 
                         I need you, Corky.

                                     CORKY
                         For what?

                                     VIOLET
                         You made a choice once.  Do you think 
                         you would make that same choice again?

                                     CORKY
                         What choice?

                                     VIOLET
                         If those quarters fell to the floor, 
                         would you still reach up to that 
                         cash register?

               Corky stares at her, knowing where this is going.  She glances 
               around the crowded bar.

                                     CORKY
                         Not here.

               EXT.  ALLEY - NIGHT

               Corky's truck sits in a gravel parking lot.

               INT.  CORKY'S TRUCK - DAY

               Through the back window of the truck, Violet and Corky are 
               silhouettes against the street light.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar is going to get the money and 
                         bring --

                                     CORKY
                         How much money?

                                     VIOLET
                         Shelly said it was over two million 
                         dollars.

               Corky quietly swallows that pill.  It begins to rain.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar will bring it to the apartment 
                         to count and go through |Shelly's 
                         books to figure out how he did it.

                                     CORKY
                         Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do 
                         you have any idea what you are saying?  
                         You are asking me to help you fuck 
                         the mob.

               Violet nods.

                                     CORKY
                         These people are serious, Violet.  
                         If you want to know how serious, ask 
                         Shelly.  They're worse than any cop 
                         because they have lots of money and 
                         no rules.  You fuck them, you've got 
                         to do it right.

                                     VIOLET
                         That's why I need your help.  You 
                         said you were good.

                                     CORKY
                         I am, but ...

               She knows Violet is challenging her.

                                     CORKY
                         All right, let's say for the moment 
                         that I believe everything you are 
                         saying.

                                     VIOLET
                         You think I'm lying?

                                     CORKY
                         I didn't say that, but since you 
                         did, let's say that you are.  It 
                         would have been easy to set Shelly 
                         up.  You could have got him killed 
                         knowing that Caesar would bring the 
                         money to the apartment.

               Violet stares, her face poker-blank.

                                     CORKY
                         All you would need to keep yourself 
                         clean would be someone unconnected, 
                         someone like me.

                                     VIOLET
                         Is that what you think?

                                     CORKY
                         I'm just making a point.  You have 
                         no idea what you're asking.  How 
                         much trust two people need to do 
                         something like this.

               She moves closer to Violet, the sound of the rain beating 
               against the metal cab.

                                     CORKY
                         For me, stealing is a lot like sex.  
                         Two people that want the same thing 
                         sit in a room and they talk, they 
                         start to plan and it's like flirting, 
                         a kind of foreplay, because the more 
                         they talk about it, the wetter they 
                         get.

               She stops.

                                     CORKY
                         The difference is, I can have sex 
                         with someone I just met, someone I 
                         hardly know, but to steal I need to 
                         know someone like I know myself.

                                     VIOLET
                         Do you think you know me like that?

                                     CORKY
                         I think ...

               They are close enough to kiss.

                                     CORKY
                         We're going to find out.

               Corky pulls back.

                                     CORKY
                         But first, I want to see this money.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Violet springs from the couch as the front door crashes open, 
               Caesar charging in.  He is doubled over, clutching something 
               to his stomach.

               He rushes to the kitchen, dumping a bloody bundle into the 
               double sink.  There is blood everywhere, smeared up and down 
               Caesar's front.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh my God ...

               Violet takes a step toward him, unsure of what has happened.

                                     CAESAR
                         Don't worry.  It ain't mine.

               He pulls a bottle of whiskey and a glass from the cupboard.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, what happened?

                                     CAESAR
                         It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking-
                         believable!

               He pours himeslf a shot, belting it back.

                                     CAESAR
                         Goddammit, look at this shirt!  It's 
                         ruined!

               He begins unbuttoning the bloody shirt.

                                     CAESAR
                         It started when Shelly took us to 
                         the money.  I tell you, Mickey Malnato 
                         knows his shit, he does.  Shelly 
                         takes us right there.

               He throws down another shot.

                                     CAESAR
                         So Shelly's down on his knees and 
                         he's pulling out this bag of money 
                         from a safe in the floor and I'm 
                         staring at it like "holy fuck!" I 
                         mean, look at it --

               He tears open the bloody bag, wet money bricks spilling out.

                                     CAESAR
                         And all I can think is how the fuck 
                         did he do this when - Bang!  Johnnie 
                         caps him.  Blood sprays everywhere, 
                         all over the money.  We've no idea 
                         if this is even all of it.

               Caesar is exasperated.

                                     CAESAR
                         And right then I go through the roof 
                         and - Boom!  I belt the dumb fuck as 
                         hard as I can.  I didn't care whose 
                         son he was, I just wanted to hit him 
                         again.  Knock some sense into that 
                         dumb son of a bitch.

               He looks at the pile of bloody money.

                                     CAESAR
                         Just look at this mess I got to deal 
                         with.

                                     VIOLET
                         What are you going to do with it?

                                     CAESAR
                         I told them to run it through the 
                         cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans 
                         for it because he's coming here 
                         tomorrow night to pick this shit up.

               Searching through a sink cabinet, he can't find what he needs.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where the hell's the laundry 
                         detergent?

                                     VIOLET
                         Ummm ...  in the linen closet.

               Caesar walks down the ball to the bathroom.  Violet's eyes 
               do not move from the pile of money.

               Corky seems to come from nowhere.  She whispers.

                                     CORKY
                         Come to my place in the morning.  
                         Early, okay?

               Violet nods.

               INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT

               Corky's hands twitch, and then flex against the ropes that 
               bind them.

               A reflex echoes through her body, muscles spasm and limbs 
               jerk against their bonds.

               As if in a dream, she struggles, trying to get free, fighting 
               toward the edge of consciousness until --

               She seems to succumb, slipping back into stillness.

               We move toward her face, her closed eyes as we again hear 
               the voices in her head.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         You're having second thoughts.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Violet is on the bed, Corky at the window.

                                     CORKY
                         ...  no.

               She turns to Violet.

                                     CORKY
                         You said he washed the money?

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah.

                                     CORKY
                         Then what?  Exactly.

                                     VIOLET
                         He hung it up.

                                     CORKY
                         What?

                                     VIOLET
                         To let it dry.

               She begins to focus on the memory.

                                     VIOLET
                         It was unreal ...

               Moving in on her face.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               Benjamin Franklin's face on a hundred-dollar bill.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Franklin's face rotates as we pull back, seeing rows of bills 
               carefully paper-clipped to lines of string.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         Hundreds, paper-clipped everywhere 
                         like leaves.

               Eyes filled with green, Violet turns inside the laundry lines 
               of money until she sees Caesar.

               Wearing his undershirt, he is across the room standing at 
               the ironing board, ironing every single bill.

               He seems to have one eye on her, one eye on his work.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         Then one by one, he ironed all of 
                         it.

               He sprays starch across several bills and presses the steaming 
               iron to them.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         Did he sleep?

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Violet is in bed, unable to sleep, listening to the machine-
               shuffle of Caesar's bill counter.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         No.  But neither did I.

               We move past her, floating toward the wall.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         All night long I listened to that 
                         sound.

               INT.  OFFICE - NIGHT

               We drift across Caesar's desk, past bricks of bound bills, 
               as Caesar folds the paper tape around another stack.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         What sound?

               He hits the counter again and we hear the sound, now very 
               loud as hundreds blur by, fluttering beneath us.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         The sound of money.

               The sound rolls into thunder --

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               That seems to shake the apartment.

                                     CORKY
                         And where is it now?

                                     VIOLET
                         In his office.  I saw it this morning.

               INT.  OFFICE - DAY

               Violet cautiously enters the office with a cup of coffee.

               Working furiously at the computer, Caesar jumps when he sees 
               her, bloodshot eyes animal-wide.

               He checks his watch as she sets the coffee in front of him.

                                     VIOLET
                         I need to go to the store.

               He nods automatically, back in his work, as she sees the 
               briefcase filled with perfect rows of hundreds.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         It's in a case, on his desk.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         Does the case lock?

               We see the open top with its silver flip-over locks.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Violet is trying to remember.

                                     VIOLET
                         Yes.

                                     CORKY
                         Good.

               Corky begins to pace, ordering the information in her head.

                                     CORKY
                         All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.

                                     VIOLET
                         Johnnie?

                                     CORKY
                         It sounded like he and Caesar don't 
                         like each other.

                                     VIOLET
                         Like each other?  They hate each 
                         other.

                                     CORKY
                         Why?

                                     VIOLET
                         It started way before I was around.  
                         I think basically it's because he 
                         thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot.  
                         But Johnnie runs Chicago because 
                         Gino is his father.

                                     CORKY
                         Who is Gino?

               Violet suddenly feels that she has made a mistake.

                                     VIOLET
                         Gino Marzzone.

                                     CORKY
                         Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, 
                         head of the Marzzone family?

                                     VIOLET
                         That's his brother.

                                     CORKY
                         ...  shit.

               Corky covers her mouth.

                                     CORKY
                         Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to 
                         pick up the money?

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah.

                                     CORKY
                         And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie 
                         Marzzone?

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah.

                                     CORKY
                         Sweet Jesus.

               Eyes wide, she paces, pulling at her lip, mumbling.

               Suddenly she freezes as it clicks into place.  She looks at 
               Violet.

                                     CORKY
                         It's perfect.

               She's pacing again.

                                     CORKY
                         Gino Marzzone is coming to your 
                         apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't 
                         it?  That means Caesar will be ready.  
                         He doesn't want to look like an idiot.  
                         Gino has been there before?

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah, twice.

                                     CORKY
                         What happened?

                                     VIOLET
                         Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, 
                         kept cleaning the apartment.  |The 
                         first time, he picked out the dress 
                         he wanted me to wear.

               Something occurs to Corky.

                                     CORKY
                         Does Johnnie hit on you?

                                     VIOLET
                         Johnnie hits on anything in high 
                         heels.

                                     CORKY
                         Has Caesar ever seen him?

                                     VIOLET
                         He does it right in front of him.

                                     CORKY
                         It's getting better and better.  
                         Keep going.

                                     VIOLET
                         Gino doesn't know English, or at 
                         least he pretends he doesn't, so he 
                         doesn't talk much.  He gets right to 
                         the point.  Both times they talked 
                         for about five minutes, had one drink 
                         and then they left.

                                     CORKY
                         What did Gino drink?

                                     VIOLET
                         Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that 
                         Caesar made a huge deal about it.

               Corky smiles, the wheels rolling.

                                     CORKY
                         All right ...

               She turns from the window and gets onto the bed.

                                     CORKY
                         I have an idea to make this work.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Violet is getting dressed, lining her lips with lip-pencil.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         You'll go back and get ready, take 
                         your time, make it real.

               As she works on her face, we see the room behind her and the 
               discarded dresses scattered about.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         The more attractive you are, the 
                         more believable it will be.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Corky breaks her thought-train.

                                     CORKY
                         What time did you say they would be 
                         there?

                                     VIOLET
                         The plane is in at seven, so I'd say 
                         about eight.

                                     CORKY
                         Any bodyguards?

                                     VIOLET
                         Gino travels with a big man named 
                         Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.

                                     CORKY
                         Fine.

               INT.  OFFICE - DAY

               Caesar again checks his watch.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         At some point Caesar is going to 
                         quit.  I'd guess sometime around 
                         six, making sure he's got time to 
                         get ready.

               The watch reads 6:10.  Caesar rubs his eyes, his temples.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Violet is at the bar in a sexy dress and high heels.

                                     CAESAR
                         Un-fucking-believable, what this guy 
                         did.  Shelly is one smart-ass 
                         mothefucker, I mean, he was one smart-
                         ass motherfucker.

               He laughs as Violet smiles, handing him an enormous drink.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         As soon as he is done, you'll be 
                         right there to put a big drink in 
                         his hand.

               He takes the drink.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         We want him to come down, to relax, 
                         feel in control again.

                                     VIOLET
                         Poor boy, has to work so hard.

               She gives him a woman's sympathy pout; he knows what it, 
               loves it anyway.

               Smiling, he slides his hand down over her ass.

                                     CAESAR
                         You look good enough to eat.

               She smiles and waits for the kiss she knows is coming.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Both women are starting to feel it, to believe it.

                                     VIOLET
                         Where will you be?

                                     CORKY
                         Waiting in the apartment next door.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT

               Corky sits on the floor of the dark apartment.  She has taken 
               off her boots, which are beside her.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         Waiting for what?

               Through the wall we can hear the shower.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         For the shower.  That will be our 
                         signal.

               Corky opens a thin box filled with needle-thin lock picks.

               She selects several and slips them into her multi-pierced 
               ears like earrings.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         When he's done with his shower, you 
                         will go to the bar.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               In slow motion, Caesar drops the shower plunger and water 
               chokes from the faucet.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Behind the bar, Violet pulls out the bottle of Glenlivet.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         You'll get out the Scotch that Gino 
                         drinks.

               Violet steps out from the bar, her eyes on the bedroom, when 
               the bottle slips from her hands.

               We watch it slowly fall --

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         And as you do, the bottle will slip 
                         from your hands.  -- and shatter 
                         against the hardwood floor.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         An accident.

                                     VIOLET
                         Shit!  Oh shit!

               Caesar yells from the bathroom.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         What happened?!

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Hearing Caesar, Corky gets up, moving quietly toward the 
               door.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         V!  What the fuck was it?!  Violet?

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar enters, a towel wrapped around him, hair still 
               dripping.

                                     CAESAR
                         V, what?  You can't hear me?

               Violet looks terribly upset as she begins to clean up.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, it slipped ...  I was trying 
                         to get ready ...

               Caesar realizing what happened.

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh, fucking Christ ...  You gotta be 
                         kidding me!

               He rushes at her.

                                     CAESAR
                         Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww 
                         goddammit!

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm sorry.  It was an accident.

               She stands up.

                                     VIOLET
                         Don't worry, I'll get some more.

                                     CAESAR
                         There's no time.

                                     VIOLET
                         Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take 
                         five minutes.

               She turns him back toward the bedroom.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'll clean this up and be back before 
                         you're even dressed.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               Violet opens her door, stepping into the hall where Corky is 
               waiting.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         When you open the door, I'll be there.

               They pass each other in silence, Violet stepping out as Corky 
               slips in.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         What if he sees you?

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         He won't.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar is working intensely on his fingernails.  We glide 
               over a set of gleaming metal manicure tools.  We see his 
               hand as he delicately applies a coat of clear polish to a 
               nail.

               Through the open door, we see Corky moving almost casually 
               across the living room.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Corky is looking for something.

                                     VIOLET
                         You can't know for certain that he 
                         won't see you.

                                     CORKY
                         Trust me, Violet.

               She finds a black duffel bag from one of her tool buckets.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm just asking, what if?

                                     CORKY
                         If he does ...

               Corky slips her hand in between the mattress and box spring, 
               pulling out a gun.

                                     CORKY
                         Then I won't have a choice, will I?

               She tosses the gun on the bed.

               INT.  OFFICE - NIGHT

               The black case is lying on the desk, locked shut.  Corky 
               moves around the desk, dropping down behind it.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         When I'm inside, I will get the money.

               From her earlobe, she chooses the right pick, sliding out 
               the silver tool.

               It takes only a second and the first lock pops open.

               She is working on the other lock when the door is pushed 
               open and Caesar walks in.

               Corky drops down, grasping for her gun --

               As Caesar, wearing only underwear, enters.  He blows on the 
               drying polish on his fingernails before delicately selecting 
               a suit from his closet.

               The gun ready, Corky, pressed against the desk, waits until 
               he leaves.

               She lets her breath out, then pops the second lock, unzips 
               the black duffel bag and quickly empties the case, filling 
               the bag with fat money bricks.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         I'm going to need something ...

               Finished, she zips up the bag and looks about.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         ...  to fill the case.

               Sbe sees a stack of newspapers hidden near the desk.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         Yeah, you should hide it near the 
                         desk before you leave.

               She fills the case, then closes it.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         At that point --

               She thumbs the locks shut and they snap, unnaturally loud, 
               into place.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               They are both on the bed.

                                     CORKY
                         There is no going back.

                                     VIOLET
                         When I get the Scotch, how do I know 
                         you won't take off?

                                     CORKY
                         The same way I'll know that you went 
                         to Scotch.  Trust.

               Their faces are close, eyes still trying to read each other.

                                     VIOLET
                         I still don't see how I'm going to 
                         get clean with the money in the 
                         apartment.  Everyone will think I 
                         did it.

                                     CORKY
                         Not Caesar.

                                     VIOLET
                         Why?

                                     CORKY
                         Because of what you are going to 
                         tell him.  You have to make it as 
                         real as you can.  The moment you 
                         open the door with the Scotch in 
                         your hand, you will be covered, and 
                         that moment is the most important 
                         moment in the plan.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The door bursts open.  Violet enters quickly, carrying a 
               bottle in a thin brown bag.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         If it's real enough, he'll believe 
                         it, because deep down he'll want to.

                                     VIOLET
                         C!  Shit, I'm sorry!

               Caesar wanders out, tightening his tie.  She looks at her 
               watch.

                                     VIOLET
                         They were early.

                                     CAESAR
                         What are you talking about?

                                     VIOLET
                         They just left, didn't they?

                                     CAESAR
                         What are you, drunk?

               He smiles, grabbing the bottle from her.

                                     VIOLET
                         You mean they weren't up here?

                                     CAESAR
                         No!  They're still on their way.

                                     VIOLET
                         That doesn't make any sense.

                                     CAESAR
                         Why?

                                     VIOLET
                         Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.

               Caesar turns.

                                     CAESAR
                         What?

                                     VIOLET
                         I was getting out of the car when I 
                         saw him in the Mercedes.

                                     CAESAR
                         It couldn't have been.

                                     VIOLET
                         It was him.  I'm positive.

                                     CAESAR
                         It's impossible!

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him.  
                         I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't 
                         believe I missed them.  I knew you 
                         were going to be upset so I thought 
                         I'd apologize and give Gino the 
                         Scotch.  I honked a couple of times 
                         but he didn't stop.

               She watches him, her words caving in around him.

                                     CAESAR
                         But Gino's plane doesn't get in for 
                         another half-hour.

               Violet thinks.

                                     VIOLET
                         Actually, I didn't see Gino in the 
                         car.

               His eyes dart.  His forehead beads with sweat.  He turns 
               toward the office.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Violet is staring at Corky's mouth.

                                     CORKY
                         If Caesar hates Johnnie like you 
                         say, then the second he opens the 
                         case he'll know, in his gut, that 
                         Johnnie just fucked him.  He'll 
                         realize that he has no choice.  He 
                         can't touch Gino or Johnnie.  There's 
                         only one way out.

               She pauses.

                                     CORKY
                         He'll have to run.

                                     VIOLET
                         If he runs, everyone will assume he 
                         took the money.

                                     CORKY
                         You'll be clean and we'll be rich.

               INT.  OFFICE - NIGHT

               Caesar stands over the desk, afraid to open the case.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

                                     VIOLET
                         Jesus, that's beautiful.

                                     CORKY
                         Thank you.

                                     VIOLET
                         If you're this goddamn smart, how 
                         did you ever get caught?

                                     CORKY
                         Every job like this has moments where 
                         things don't go so well and everyone 
                         starts thinking about their own ass.  
                         It's in those moments that everything 
                         comes together or falls apart.

               She looks dead at Violet.

                                     CORKY
                         I had a partner and she fucked me.

                                     VIOLET
                         I won't.

                                     CORKY
                         I think we're going to find out.

               INT.  OFFICE - NIGHT

               The key turns and the locks pop.  When Caesar sees the 
               newspaper, the whole world begins to spin.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar?

               His chest collapses onto itself while his hands ball into 
               fists.

                                     CAESAR
                         No no no no ...

               She moves around the side of the desk and sees the newspaper.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh God ...

               He slams the case shut, his head hanging down.

               After a moment he looks at her, like a little boy about to 
               cry.

                                     CAESAR
                         ...  I've been set up.

               He seems ready to scream but can't say anything.

                         Johnnie?

               The name is like water hitting hot oil.

                         That fuck!  That rat-fuck!  Little 
                         shit rat-fuck!

               He starts punching the desk, each blow harder than the last.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky can hear him pounding.  She looks down and smiles.  
               Between her legs is the open bag stuffed with money.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Caesar is choking on his own rage.

                                     VIOLET
                         Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?

                         Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your 
                         fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like 
                         I hate him!

               He starts to pound his fists against his own head.

                                     CAESAR

                         your head, Violet.  The money is 
                         gone.  Gino is coming here to get 
                         it.  You think he's going to believe 
                         me if I tell him his piss-hole son 
                         stole it!  Is that what you think?  
                         I don't.  You know what I think?  I 
                         think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in 
                         the brain.  That's what I think!

                         Caesar, what are we going to do?

               He grabs hold of his chair, using it to support himself

                                     CAESAR
                         I know what he wants me to do.  He 
                         wants me out of here.  He wants me 
                         to run.

               She watches him, his body rocking against the chair.

                                     CAESAR
                         If I run, then everyone will think I 
                         took the money and he walks away 
                         with two million clean.

               The words squeeze out like tears.

                                     CAESAR
                         God, I can see him right now driving 
                         to get Gino.  I can hear him laughing, 
                         fucking laughing, laughing at me.

               He swings the swivel chair over his head and smashes it down 
               on the desk.  Again and again.

                                     CAESAR
                         Laughing at me!  Laughing at me!

               The chair falls and he stands alone, covering his face to 
               hide his tears.

                                     VIOLET
                         C ...

               She goes to hold him.

                                     CAESAR
                         Don't touch me!

               He backs into the corner of the room.

                                     CAESAR
                         Just leave me alone!  I got to think!

               Violet watches him trying to wipe the tears and sweat from 
               his face.

                                     CAESAR
                         Got to think this through ...

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, maybe we should run --

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet, please!

                                     VIOLET
                         I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, 
                         forget the money, let's just go now, 
                         before it's too late --

                                     CAESAR
                         Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just 
                         leave me the fuck alone!  Please!  
                         Leave!  Now!

                                     VIOLET
                         All right, Caesar.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Violet enters, closing the door quietly behind her.  She 
               looks at the wall, then goes to the bed and picks up the 
               phone.

               As she dials, we move along the phone cord, following it 
               down to the jack in the wall.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               We move out from another jack, following a different cord.

               Corky is sitting with her back to the wall.  The black phone 
               beside her barely rings once before she answers.

               She waits, saying nothing.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         It's me.

                                     CORKY
                         What happened?

               INT.  BEDROOM NIGHT

               Violet whispers, her hand cupped over the mouthpiece.

                                     VIOLET
                         He totally freaked.  I've never seen 
                         him like this.  He's out of his 
                         fucking mind.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         That's okay, as long as he believes 
                         it was Johnnie.

                                     VIOLET
                         Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving 
                         him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I 
                         don't know, Corky, I don't know what 
                         he is going to do.  I'm getting 
                         nervous, really nervous.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

                                     CORKY
                         It's all right, Violet.  It's working.  
                         All we got to do is wait him out and 
                         see what he does.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         What if he doesn't run?

                                     CORKY
                         That means he probably will kill 
                         Johnnie.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!

                                     CORKY
                         Listen, if he doesn't run, all you 
                         have to do is break down, go to your 
                         bedroom and pack some things, start 
                         crying, saying you love him but you 
                         can't do it.  You're sorry but you 
                         have to leave and just walk out.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

                                     VIOLET
                         okay, all right.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         We're almost there, Violet.  just 
                         hang on.

               Violet hears him.

                                     VIOLET
                         He's coming ...

               She hangs up quickly just as Caesar bursts in.

                                     CAESAR
                         I got it!  I know what I got to do!  
                         I got to get the money.

                                     VIOLET
                         The money?  The money's gone.

                                     CAESAR
                         No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to 
                         do is get it back.

                                     VIOLET
                         But it could be anywhere.

                                     CAESAR
                         He didn't have that much time.  He 
                         had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's 
                         got it with him.  I bet it's in the 
                         car.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky presses against the wall, trying to hear.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Caesar is pacing.

                                     CAESAR
                         He didn't see you, did he?

                                     VIOLET
                         No.

                                     CAESAR
                         See, right now he doesn't know that 
                         I know, that's why he put the paper 
                         in the case.  He wants me to hand 
                         the case to Gino.  Then there is no 
                         doubt it was me.  Gino will put a 
                         bullet in me himself.  But it ain't 
                         going to happen.  I won't let it!  
                         Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not 
                         like this!  No way!

                                     VIOLET
                         This is insane!

               She throws open her closet.

                                     CAESAR
                         What are you doing?

               She grabs a suitcase from under the bed.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm leaving!  This is crazy!  I don't 
                         want to be involved.  I don't want 
                         anything to do with this shit!

               She starts yanking the dresses from the closet.

                                     CAESAR
                         You can't leave.

                                     VIOLET
                         The hell I can't!

                                     CAESAR
                         I need you ...

                                     VIOLET
                         Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've 
                         never needed me!  I can't help you!  
                         Understand?!  I have to get out.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet, I won't let you leave.

               She turns and sees that he is holding a gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         If you're not with me, Violet, then 
                         I have to assume you're against me.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, this is crazy.

                                     CAESAR
                         Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe 
                         you dropped the Scotch by accident.  
                         Maybe you didn't.

               Now it is her turn to feel the world spin.

                                     CAESAR
                         It would have been so easy to let 
                         him in as you went out.

                                     VIOLET
                         You don't, you can't believe that 
                         ...

                                     CAESAR
                         I've seen the way he looks at you.  
                         He's always wanted you.  Maybe two 
                         million dollars finally bought you.

               She slaps him hard.  He stares at her.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm sorry, Violet, but it has to be 
                         this way.

               He moves past her, picks up the dresses and returns them to 
               the closet.

                                     CAESAR
                         I hope you understand.  I want to 
                         trust you, I want to believe you, 
                         but I don't have any other choice.

               He shuts the closet.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

               Caesar is at the bar, drinking the Scotch.  The gun in front 
               of him.  Across the room, Violet sits, staring holes through 
               him.

               They wait in silence.

                                     CAESAR
                         You sure you don't want a drink?

               Violet says nothing.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               In the dark, Corky sits, her face, her posture very similar 
               to Violet's.

               She is concentrating, her mind somewhere else, when the door 
               buzzer sounds.

               She turns her head and hears Caesar faintly answering the 
               intercom.

               Corky stands just as --

               INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

               Violet stands.

               Caesar faces her for a moment, then shoves the gun into his 
               belt behind his back.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky watches through the door peep as three men pass by.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               There is a knock and Caesar opens the door.

               GINO MARZZONE is an old Italian whose face is a mask of 
               irritated indifference.

               ROY, his enormous driver, is behind him.

               Caesar smiles, greeting them in Italian with open arms.

               Johnnie is the last inside.  He has tape over his broken 
               nose.  He smiles and hugs Caesar.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         You shouldn't have hit me.

                                     CAESAR
                         You want to get into this now?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         No, no, Caesar.  Not now.

               He smiles again, patting him on the shoulder, then throwing 
               a fake punch.

               Caesar sees Gino with his bright Italian smile, flattering 
               Violet, kissing her.

                                     GINO
                         Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this 
                         girl, or I find out!

                                     JOHNNIE
                         You are as radiant as ever, Violet.

               As he bends to kiss her hand, she sees Caesar watching them.

                                     CAESAR
                         Glenlivet, right, Gino?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm not drinking.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Then neither will I.

               This makes Violet very uncomfortable.

                                     VIOLET
                         No, I'll have a Tanqueray and tonic.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Caesar, make that two TNTs.

               Caesar's hand shakes as he pours Gino's Scotch.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 

               Pacing in her socks, Corky tries to think through several 
               possible situations.  She stops, staring at the bag of money.

               The idea of its sitting out in the open suddenly bothers 
               her.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Caesar hands Violet and Johnnie a drink.  He stares at her.  
               She stares back.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Salud, eh.  Roy, Violet, Pop, Caesar.

               Caesar watches Johnnie, suspecting everything he does.

               Johnnie reaches into his pocket and takes out a cellular 
               phone.

                                     GINO
                         No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones.  
                         Not now.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Pop?

                                     GINO
                         Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk 
                         now.  You too, Johnnie.

               Each man sits on either side of Gino.

                                     GINO
                         Caesar, look at me.  Johnnie tell me 
                         what happened.  Caesar, you gotta do 
                         me a favor, a personal favor.  For 
                         me, eh?  You gotta start respecting 
                         Johnnie the way you respect me.  You 
                         understand?  Good.

               Caesar sees Johnnie smiling at him, but when Gino turns, the 
               smile disappears.

                                     GINO
                         And you, Johnnie.  You gonna stop 
                         acting stupid.  You gotta earn this 
                         respect that Caesar's gonna give.  
                         You understand?  Good.  Done.  Now, 
                         where's my money?

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky drops a hefty bag, knotted tight, into an open five-
               gallon bucket of paint.

               As she picks up a paint stick, we see a second bag beside 
               another bucket.

               She pushes the first bag down until it disappears, enveloped 
               by the milk-white liquid.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Caesar puts the briefcase onto the coffee table.

               Gino looks up at Caesar, very serious, with his hand on the 
               case.

                                     GINO
                         We know how this was done, eh?

                                     CAESAR
                         Yeah, I know.

               He looks dead at Johnnie.

                                     GINO
                         It won't happen again, eh?

               Caesar shakes his head.

                                     GINO
                         Good.

               Gino throws down the last of the Scotch.

                                     GINO
                         Done.  We go now.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours 
                         until your plane leaves.

               Gino checks his watch, shouting in Italian.  Johnnie shouts 
               back until Gino throws up his hands, refusing to listen.

                                     GINO
                         Caesar!

               He gestures to his empty glass, then folds his arms, leaning 
               back.  Caesar gets the bottle.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         So Caesar, what did it total out at?

                                     CAESAR
                         Two point one seventy-six.

               Johnnie whistles as Caesar pours Gino another Scotch.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, 
                         Violet?

                                     GINO
                         Hey, Johnnie ...

               In Italian tells him to shut up.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Come on, Pop, all I want to know is 
                         one thing.  Just one thing after he 
                         made such a big deal out of it.  I 
                         bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, 
                         Caesar?

                                     CAESAR
                         What's that, Johnnie?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         The money I bet it was nothing to 
                         get it clean, after you made such a 
                         fucking big deal ...

                                     GINO
                         Johnnie, what did I say?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Pop, this is important to me.  It's 
                         a simple question.  if he would just 
                         answer the question, that's the end 
                         of it.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where is this going, Johnnie?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Just admit it, Caesar.

                                     CAESAR
                         Admit what?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         That you overreacted.  That you lost 
                         it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.

               Caesar sees it so clearly now.

                                     CAESAR
                         All right, Johnnie, you want to play 
                         it this way, I can play it this way.  
                         You want to know who made a mistake, 
                         why don't you open the case.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar ...

                                     CAESAR
                         Shut up, Violet!  This is between me 
                         and Johnnie.

               He pushes the case toward him.

                                     CAESAR
                         You want to do this now, let's do 
                         it.  Open the case.  Open the fucking 
                         case.

               Johnnie stares at him, feeling that something is very wrong.

                                     CAESAR
                         That's right, I know.  I fucking 
                         know.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Know what?

                                     CAESAR
                         Open the case!

                                     JOHNNIE
                         All right!  Where's the key?

                                     CAESAR
                         You don't need a key.

               He tries but it's locked.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         How the fuck can I open it?

                                     CAESAR
                         The same way you did before.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         What are you talking about?

               Caesar smiles and tosses the key onto the table.

                                     CAESAR
                         There you go, Johnnie.

               He reaches for the key.  Caesar stands up and gives Violet 
               his drink.

                                     CAESAR
                         Get me another.

               He can see the fear on her face as she goes to the bar.

               Time drips.

               The key turns.  One lock pops.

               Then the other.

               Tbe case opens like a scream and Johnnie sees the newspaper.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         What the ...

               Before anybody can move, Caesar whips around with his gun.

               Roy jumps off his stool, his drink crashing to the floor.

                                     CAESAR
                         Don't!  Don't fucking move!

               Nobody can believe what is happening.

                                     GINO
                         Caesar?  What is this?

                                     CAESAR
                         Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!

                                     JOHNNIE
                         What the fuck?

               Caesar levels the gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         You don't think I'll do it, do you?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         I think you're fucking crazy!

                                     CAESAR
                         Where is it?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Where's what?

                                     CAESAR
                         The money!

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Caesar, I don't know what you're 
                         thinking here, but if you don't put 
                         down that gun --

               He stands up.

                                     CAESAR
                         Sit down!

               He does.

                                     GINO
                         Caesar!

                                     CAESAR
                         Gino, your son stole this money to 
                         set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!

               She doesn't know what to say.

                                     CAESAR
                         Tell them!  Tell them!

                                     VIOLET
                         For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what 
                         he says.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         This isn't happening ...

               Boom!  Caesar blows a hole in the couch right between 
               Johnnie's legs.  Johnnie screams.

                                     CAESAR
                         The next one blows off your dick.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         You're a dead man!  A fucking dead 
                         man!

                                     CAESAR
                         Where is it?

                                     GINO
                         Enough!

               Gino jumps up.

                                     CAESAR
                         No, Gino!

                                     GINO
                         You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know 
                         who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You 
                         understand?

               He starts walking toward Caesar.  Roy moves around for a 
               good angle.

                                     CAESAR
                         Sit down, Gino!

                                     GINO
                         No, Caesar, gimme the gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         Stay away!

               He backs up as Gino walks straight to him.

                                     GINO
                         We're family, Caesar.

                                     CAESAR
                         No!

                                     GINO
                         Gimme the gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         I can't.  I can't.

                                     GINO
                         Give it to me.

               He reaches up and takes bold of the barrel.  Caesar looks 
               resigned as he shuts his eyes.

                                     GINO
                         Good man.

               Close on Gino's hand holding the gun barrel as --

               Caesar fires.

               From behind the gun we watch Gino's grip yanked free, time 
               melting away as he falls, blood bubbling from his chest, his 
               eyes wide in disbelief.

               His body hits the floor and the room erupts.

               Roy dives, drawing his gun as Caesar continues to fire, 
               pumping the trigger.

               Violet drops behind the bar as Jobnnie screams, falling 
               towards his father.

               Blood spurts from Roy as two bullets hit, his gun clattering 
               and sliding across the floor.

               Johnnie lunges at Caesar as Caesar turns and fires, hitting 
               Johnnie everywhere; blood and meat spray and speckle 
               everything around him.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The gun continues to fire as Corky clutches the phone, 
               whispering.

                                     CORKY
                         This is an emergency!

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Crunched down behind the bar, Violet listens to the only 
               sound, repeating in the unnatural quiet:

               Click.  Click.

               Click.

               Rising, she peers over the edge of the bar.

               Caesar is standing in the aftermath.  His gun is still aimed 
               at Johnnie as he pulls the trigger over and over.

               The bodies are still, blood silently pooling around them.

               Blinking the sweat from his eyes, Caesar sees Violet.

                                     CAESAR
                         I had to do it, Violet.  You saw it.  
                         I had no choice.  It was Johnnie.  
                         That lying fuck.  He made me do it.

               He looks down at Jobnnie, hate rising like bile.

                                     CAESAR
                         You lying rat-fuck.  You think you 
                         can set me up?  Is that what you 
                         think?  You stupid fuck.

               Kicking the body, be causes a series of sickening wet noises.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm a dead man?  I'm a dead man?  
                         Guess again, fuck-face.  Who's dead?  
                         Who's the dead lying rat-fuck?  Take 
                         another guess, take another fucking 
                         guess!

               He stops, panting, unable to catch his breath.  Violet is 
               afraid to even look at him.

               Blood creeps along the edge of the floorboards.

               Caesar tries to clear his head, mopping the sweat from his 
               face.  He bends down and starts searching Johnnie's pockets.

               He finds his keys.

                                     VIOLET
                         What are you doing?

               Lost in thought, he goes to Gino.  Throwing open the coat, 
               he sees the airplane ticket.  There is a bullet hole in it.

               He checks the times and then his watch.

                                     CAESAR
                         ...  maybe three hours.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, what are you going to do?

                                     CAESAR
                         What do you think we're going to do?  
                         We have to find the money.

                                     VIOLET
                         What?

                                     CAESAR
                         Once we have the money, then none of 
                         this ever happened.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.

                                     CAESAR
                         No I didn't.  Not if his body 
                         disappears and not if the money is 
                         still here.  Then they never showed 
                         up.

                                     VIOLET
                         What happened to them?

                                     CAESAR
                         I don't know.  We may never know, 
                         but I'm going to guess it was a job, 
                         maybe the Karpoli family.

               He smiles.

                                     CAESAR
                         All part of the business.

               He picks up Roy's gun and stuffs it in his belt.

                                     CAESAR
                         We just got to find the money.  Once 
                         we do, everything is going to be all 
                         right.

               In the distance, the wail of a police siren can be heard.

               EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Through the window they see a squad car, lights blaring, 
               roll up in front of the building.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh, no.

               He turns back to the carnage.

                                     CAESAR
                         Fuck.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, what are we going to do?

                                     CAESAR
                         They're just cops.  Stall them as 
                         long as you can.

               Caesar flies into action.

               Grunting, he hauls Gino's body up, drags it to the bathroom 
               and throws it into the tub.  He returns for Johnnie's body.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Standing near the bathroom, Corky hears the metal echo of 
               the tub.  Looking at her tub, she imagines what he is doing.

               Through the wall, she hears the door buzzer.

               INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The buzzer sounds again as Violet sees him lift Roy's body.

                                     CAESAR
                         Answer it!

               He heads back to the bathroom, dropping Roy onto the other 
               two.

               The three bloody bodies fill the tub.

               We see Johnnie's arm hanging over the edge as Caesar snaps 
               the shower curtain around, hiding them.

                                     VIOLET
                         Hello?

                                     COP #1 (V.O.)
                         This is the police, ma'am.

               She cuts them off using the intercom.

                                     VIOLET
                         The police?

               Over her shoulder she sees Caesar moving the furniture, 
               clearing the area around the heavy bloodstains.

                                     COP #1 (V.O.)
                         We had a report of gunfire, so if 
                         you could --

                                     VIOLET
                         Gunfire?  Is this a joke?

               Violet sees Caesar hurry to his office.

                                     COP #1 (V.O.)
                         No joke, ma'am.  Please open the 
                         door.

                                     VIOLET
                         How do I know you are cops?

               INT.  OFFICE - NIGHT

               Caesar seizes the beautiful oriental rug in his office and 
               yanks it up, overturning furniture.  Dragging it out, he 
               slams the door behind him.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Violet looks at Caesar, who is working with the calm, single-
               minded focus of a machine.

                                     COP #1 (V.O.)
                         Ma'am, you have to open the door.

                                     VIOLET
                         All right.

               She buzzes them in as Caesar throws the rug like someone 
               making a bed, letting it fall to the floor and cover most of 
               the blood.

               INT.  LOBBY - NIGHT

               The cops are waiting for the elevator.  After a moment, the 
               door slides open.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Violet moves away from the intercom as Caesar begins arranging 
               the furniture on the rug.

                                     CAESAR
                         Get me a wet towel.

               His words push her to the bathroom.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Stuffing a towel into the sink, she turns on the water.  She 
               does not even look at the shower curtain.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               The elevator opens and the cops step out.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Caesar grabs the television remote, hits "on" and jacks the 
               volume until it is obviously loud.

               Violet returns and he snatches the towel from her.

               INT.  HALL

               As the two cops walk down the hall, they hear the television.  
               They look at each other, already knowing what happened.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Like a maniac, Caesar wipes at any blood still visible until 
               there is a knock on the door.  He grabs Violet by the arm.

                                     CAESAR
                         If you're thinking about doing 
                         something stupid, remember I just 
                         killed Gino Marzzone.  You understand 
                         what that means?

               She nods.

                                     VIOLET
                         They're just cops.

               There is another knock, much louder.

               Violet goes to the door as Caesar rips off his blood-soaked 
               jacket and shirt.

               He drops down behind the bar Leaving the chain on, Violet 
               opens the door.  Tbe cops smile.

                                     COP #1
                         See?  We're for real.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.

                                     COP #1
                         You did the right thing.

               Crouching, Caesar wipes vigorously at the blood on his hands 
               and face.

               Violet opens the door.

               Caesar crams the bloody wad under the bar sink.

               Just as the cops enter the living room, Caesar stands, looking 
               comfortable in no shirt, with ice cubes in his hands.

                                     CAESAR
                         Hey, hey, Chicago's finest.

               He plunks the ice into a glass and walks from behind the bar

                                     CAESAR
                         How's it going tonight, fellas?

                                     COP #1
                         Pretty good, sir.

               Caesar turns his head.

                                     CAESAR
                         Huh?  I'm sorry, I can only hear in 
                         this ear.

               Tbe cops look at each other again.

               Wiping his wet hand on his pants, Caesar shakes hands with 
               each of them.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm Caesar and this here is my Violet.

               They smile at Violet as Caesar puts his arm around her.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet said something about gunshots?

               Violet sees the gun wedged in the back of his belt.

                                     COP #2
                         Yes, sir, a neighbor in the building 
                         called in.

                                     COP #1
                         I think we know what happened.

                                     COP #2
                         It was probably just the television.

                                     CAESAR
                         The television?

               He looks at Violet.

                                     CAESAR
                         Honey, why didn't you say something?  
                         Turn it off.

               Violet walks across the rug and turns off the TV.

                                     CAESAR
                         Fuck, this happened before.  It's 
                         this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The 
                         batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm 
                         sorry.

                                     COP #1
                         It's all right, sir.

                                     COP #2
                         No big deal.

                                     CAESAR
                         Hey, can I get you guys a beer?

                                     COP #1
                         Not on duty, sorry.

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh, right.

                                     COP #2
                         But, uh, would you mind if I used 
                         your bathroom?

               Caesar's face tightens.

                                     CAESAR
                         Yeah, why not?  It's right there.

                                     COP #2
                         Thanks.

               He heads for the john.

               Violet watches Caesar back up to the bar, moving behind it.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm going to make myself a drink, if 
                         that's okay?

                                     COP #1
                         Go right ahead, sir.

               INT.  BATHROOM NIGHT

               Cop #2 enters, walking right past the shower curtain.  We 
               hear his sigh as he starts to piss.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Cop #1 walks onto the rug, looking around, turning to Violet.

                                     COP #1
                         This is a beautiful place.

                                     VIOLET
                         ...  thank you.

               She stares at his shoes on the rug.

               Watching everything, Caesar takes a sip of his drink.  He 
               slips his gun out and holds it at his side.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               There is a bulge in the shower curtain where we imagine 
               Johnnie's arm is hanging.

               Slowly we slide down to the bottom edge of the plastic 
               curtain, where a drip of blood forms and --

               Plips into a small red spot on the white tile floor.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Close on the heel of the cop's black shoe, where we can almost 
               see the blood seeping up through the oriental rug.

                                     COP #1
                         Is this a condo?

               Violet nods.

               Everyone turns when Cop #2 busts out of the bathroom.

                                     COP #2
                         Okay, let's roll.

               Cop #1 walks across the rug to the hardwood floor.  He turns 
               to Caesar.

                                     COP #1
                         Try to keep the extra batteries for 
                         your aid around.

                                     CAESAR
                         Good idea.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky hears the cop say goodbye to Violet.  The door closes.  
               She isn't sure what she should do.

               Over her shoulder, she notes the bucket of paint.  She lets 
               the cops leave.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Caesar puts on a new shirt, the gun stuffed in his pants.

                                     CAESAR
                         Let's go.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky rises at the sound of Caesar's door closing.

               We track her along the wall to the foyer as she follows the 
               faint sounds of Caesar and Violet's footsteps.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               As they pass by, Violet looks up to the door of the empty 
               apartment, straight at the peephole.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT Corky is pressed against the door, eye 
               at the peephole.

               She sees that Violet is afraid as the two women seem to speak 
               to each other with their eyes.

                                     CORKY
                         ...  shit.

               EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Caesar is on his knees, searching under the seats of Johnnie's 
               Mercedes.  Unable to find the money, he is ready to snap.

               From the main doors, Corky slips out of the building.  Hiding 
               behind a column, she sees Violet and Caesar across the lot.

               Corky moves behind the parked cars, the gun squeezed in her 
               hand.

               Violet edges away, on the verge of running, looking toward 
               the busy street.

               Standing, Caesar pounds on the car.

                                     CAESAR
                         Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, someone could see us out 
                         here.

               Ignoring her, be tries to think.

                                     CAESAR
                         Get in.

               Still too far from them to do anytbing, Corky sees Caesar 
               slam the trunk.

                                     CAESAR
                         Get in!  It's got to be at his house.  
                         That's the only other place it could 
                         be.

               Violet looks around the lot, looking for some way out.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet!  Now!

               Corky can only watch as Violet gets in and the car rips away.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Alone, Corky stands over the bucket of paint.  She kicks it 
               with her boot-toe.

                                     CORKY
                         Two million dollars, Cork ...  Two 
                         million dollars ...

               She sighs, wondering how long she can make herself wait.

               EXT.  JOHNNIE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               The BMW is parked in front.

               INT.JOHNNIE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               Close on Caesar, as he rakes his sweaty hair back, his face 
               knotted in torment.

                                     CAESAR
                         Okay, I come in ...

               He turns as if he just came in through the front door.

               We see Johnnie's home has been laid to waste.  The furniture 
               is broken, cushions split open, pictures shattered, holes 
               punched in the drywall -- even the carpeting has been torn 
               up.

               Caesar doesn't look much better.

                                     CAESAR
                         I've got the money ...

               Huddled in a corner, Violet watches him.

                                     CAESAR
                         I can't wait to see the look on 
                         Caesar's face when he finds out.

               Caesar moves from the front door, trying to get into Johnnie's 
               head.

                                     CAESAR
                         Now I don't have much time ...

               He takes a couple of steps into the room.

                                     CAESAR
                         Got to put it someplace safe ...

               He looks at a closet.  It's gutted, searched 10 times already.

                                     CAESAR
                         ...  put it ...

               A couple more uneasy steps and he looks at a large over-turned 
               rolltop desk.

                                     CAESAR
                         ...  got it ...

               He starts looking around the room as if he is seeing for the 
               first time that it is destroyed.  He is near the breaking 
               point.

                                     VIOLET
                         C?

               His voice cracks.  There is nowhere else to look.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where did I put it?

               He explodes.  A terra cotta lamp sails across the room.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where's my fucking money?!  Fucking 
                         cocksuckers!  Where the fuck is it?!

               He smashes his forehead into the wall, denting the drywall.

                                     CAESAR
                         Ow.

               He holds his head, sinking to the ground.

                                     VIOLET
                         C?

               She sits next to him, putting a hand lightly on his shoulder.

                                     VIOLET
                         It's not here, Caesar.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where, then?

                                     VIOLET
                         I don't know.  it could be anywhere.  
                         We don't even know if he was alone.  
                         Please, Caesar, we don't have much 
                         time.  Let's get out of here.

               He knows what he has to do.  Digging through the debris, he 
               finds the phone.

                                     VIOLET
                         What are you doing?

                                     CAESAR
                         We're going to need some time.

                                     VIOLET
                         Who are you going to call?

               Already dialing, he does not answer

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar?

               Ceaar takes a deep breath, mustering composure.

                                     MICKEY (V.O.)
                         Yeah?

                                     CAESAR
                         Hey, Mickey.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh, God.

                                     MICKEY (V.O.)
                         Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?

                                     CAESAR
                         Mick, I know it's late, but there is 
                         a problem.  They haven't shown up 
                         yet.

                                     MICKEY (V.O.)
                         What?  They ain't there?

                                     CAESAR
                         No.  I don't know where they are.  I 
                         even called over at Johnnie's, but 
                         no answer.

                                     MICKEY (V.O.)
                         Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see 
                         what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, 
                         okay?

                                     CAESAR
                         Okay, sure, Mick.

                                     MICKEY (V.O.)
                         Caesar, you still got the money?

               Caesar looks at Violet.

                                     CAESAR
                         Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money.  
                         I'm staring right at it.

                                     MICKEY (V.O.)
                         Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.

               He hangs up.

               INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

               Caesar drags himself in.  Violet closes the door behind them.

               Caesar moves into the room where it happened.  He is dizzy 
               and confused and does not want to be here.

               Violet turns him around.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'll start packing.  You know what 
                         you have to do.

               She turns him toward the bathroom.  He nods.

                                     CAESAR
                         I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in 
                         Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic 
                         bags ...  tape and rope ...

                                     VIOLET
                         Just hurry.

               Nodding, he heads for the kitchen.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Violet enters and goes straight for the phone.  She looks at 
               the blank wall as she dials.

                                     VIOLET
                         Please, Corky ...

               The phone rings.

               When Corky answers, Violet almost collapses with relief.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh, thank God.

                                     CORKY
                         I'm still here.

                                     VIOLET
                         I was so afraid you ...

                                     CORKY
                         You don't quit on me, Violet, and I 
                         won't quit on you.

               INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

               A box of Hefty bags tucked under his arm, a coil of 
               clothesline in his hand, Caesar searches through several 
               cabinets.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Violet glances at the door.

                                     VIOLET
                         Corky, it worked!  He's going to 
                         run.  He needs to take care of the 
                         bodies to buy himself time, but as 
                         soon as he leaves, it's over.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky falls against the wall.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         just a little longer and it's ours.

               INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Mumbling to himself, Caesar walks out of the kitchen, heading 
               for the bedroom.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Violet reaches out and touches the wall, as if she were 
               touching Corky.

                                     VIOLET
                         Corky, I have to tell you something 
                         ...

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky turns to the wall.

                                     CORKY
                         I know, Violet.  I know.

               Her fingers gently touch the wall as we travel up and over, 
               where we see they are actually touching the wall in the exact 
               same place.

                                     CORKY
                         It's why I'm still here.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Suddenly, Violet hears Caesar.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         Violet?

               As he opens the door, she slams down the phone.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The line cuts off.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Fear and panic paralyze Violet as Caesar drops everything, 
               grabbing for his gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         Who was that?

               He levels the gun at her.

                                     CAESAR
                         Who the fuck was that?

               She stands and be rushes at her, grabbing her by the throat.

                                     CAESAR
                         Was that Mickey?  Did you call Mickey?  
                         Did you?!

               She shakes her head and he throws her on the bed.  The gun 
               aimed at her, he picks up the phone and --

               Hits the redial.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Unsure of what happened, Corky hears the phone ring and 
               answers it on reflex.

               Listening, she waits.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar listens, waiting as long as he can.

                                     CAESAR
                         Mickey?  Is that you?

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky hangs up, jumping away from the wall.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar hits the redial again.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Panicking, Corkydoesn't answer it, but as it rings very loud 
               in the empty apartment, she realizes her mistake.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Turning slowly toward the wall, Caesar hears the phone ringing 
               in the empty apartment.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky rips the plug out of the wall.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The line goes dead.

                                     CAESAR
                         Who is that?  Who is over there?!  
                         Tell me!

               She tries to get away, but he grabs her and slaps her to the 
               ground.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT

               Corky hears Violet scream and that does it.  Gun in hand, 
               she flies at the door.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The door to the empty apartment slams shut and Caesar, hearing 
               it, starts to run --

               But Violet reaches out, catching his ankle, sending him 
               crashing to the dresser.

                                     VIOLET
                         Run!  Just run!

               INT HALL - NIGHT

               The door to Caesar's apartment is locked.  Corky falls to 
               one knee, whipping two lock picks from her earlobe.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar raises the gun to pistol-whip Violet and she screams.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               Working the lock, Corky hears Violet's scream cut off.

               She feels the tumblers click, and rotates the cylinder.

               A shadow stirs under the crack of the door as she hears 
               something that sounds like footsteps.  Corky freezes.

               Corky presses down low against the door beneath the peephole.

               She can almost feel Caesar beyond the door, but grits her 
               teeth and turns the doorknob.

               INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The door cracks open and Corky slips in, gun-first.  As she 
               moves into the room, we see Caesar behind her.

               He puts his gun to her head.

                                     CAESAR
                         Drop the fucking gun or die!

               Corky hesitates.

                                     CAESAR
                         Drop it!

               She does.

                                     CAESAR
                         Turn around.

               Rising from her crouch, she turns and he recognizes her.

                                     CAESAR
                         You!?  Holy fucking Christ!  You 
                         gotta be kidding me!

               He starts to laugh when she strikes --

               Knocking the gun, she punches him, slamming him back against 
               the door as --

               She twists, diving, grabbing her gun, just as --

               He steps and kicks her full in the face.

               INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT

               Still unconscious, Corky's head jerks, reacting to the kick.  
               We see the dried blood caked to her check where his kick 
               split the skin.  She is again swimming toward consciousness.

               We hear water splash, her face flinching as we move closer, 
               the sounds and voices echoing.

                                     CESAR (V.O.)
                         Wake up!  Come on, you fucking dyke!

               We hear Caesar slapping her.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         Wake up!

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Corky's face is dripping with water as her eyes slowly blink 
               open.

               Coming into focus is Caesar, standing over her with an empty 
               glass in one hand.

                                     CAESAR
                         Good.

               Except for the gag, she is bound as we have seen her bound 
               in the closet.

               Caesar yanks out his gun and puts it to her head.

                                     CAESAR
                         I know everything now so I don't 
                         want to hear any "I don't know" 
                         bullshit, you understand?

               She sees Violet on the bed, also bound hand and foot.

                                     CAESAR
                         God, I should have seen this coming!  
                         The second I met you, I knew it.  
                         Everyone knows your kind can't be 
                         trusted!  Fucking queers make me 
                         sick.

               The gun digs into her cheek.

                                     CAESAR
                         But you tried to fuck the wrong guy.  
                         And I swear to you that I'm going to 
                         kill you for it.

               He thumbs back the hammer.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where is the money?

                                     VIOLET
                         Don't tell him --

                                     CAESAR
                         Shut up, Violet!

                                     VIOLET
                         He can't kill you --

               He aims the gun at Violet.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet!

                                     VIOLET
                         Not until he has the money!

               He fires and she jumps as the bullet punches through the 
               wall behind her.

               His point made, he puts the gun back to Corky's head.

                                     CAESAR
                         Now, where the fuck is my money?

                                     CORKY
                         Lick me.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where is it?

                                     CORKY
                         Either pull the trigger or get that 
                         thing out of my face.

               Blood temperature rising again, Caesar pulls the gun back 
               and slaps her with it.

                                     CAESAR
                         Stupid cunt!

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, stop acting like an asshole 
                         and think --

                                     CAESAR
                         Don't try to tell me what to do.

                                     VIOLET
                         You need the money just like we do.

                                     CAESAR
                         Shut up, Violet.

                                     VIOLET
                         Let us go and we'll make a deal.

               He rushes at her, grabbing a fistful of her hair.

                                     CAESAR
                         Shut the fuck up!

               He looks at Corky.

                                     CAESAR
                         What did you do to her?!  This isn't 
                         my Violet!

               He looks at her as if unable to recognize her

                                     CAESAR
                         What did she do to you?

                                     VIOLET
                         Everything you couldn't.

               He shoves her down.

                                     CAESAR
                         You ungrateful bitch!  You had nothing 
                         before I met you.  You were nothing!

               He stomps around the room.

                                     CAESAR
                         Who gave you this place?  This 
                         apartment?

               He throws open the closet.

                                     CAESAR
                         Who gave us all of this?  I did!  I 
                         gave you everything!  I gave you 
                         this life!  I made you, Violet.  I 
                         saved you.

               He seems to believe what he is saying.

                                     CAESAR
                         I saved you.

                                     VIOLET
                         Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at 
                         yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug.  
                         |You launder money for the mob.  You 
                         rent women like you rented this 
                         apartment.

               He doesn't want to hear this.

                                     VIOLET
                         Saved me?  You don't even know me.  
                         You used me, Caesar, just like I 
                         used you.  All part of the business.

                                     CAESAR
                         You betrayed me!

                                     VIOLET
                         You murdered Gino!

                                     CAESAR
                         I had to.  You made me.

                                     VIOLET
                         Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me.  
                         You did it because you couldn't stand 
                         the thought of Johnnie fucking you.

                                     CAESAR
                         Shut up!

               He slaps her.

                                     CAESAR
                         Okay, you want business, I'll give 
                         you the fucking business.

               He leans closer.  

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm going to make you beg just like 
                         Shelly did.  Just like Shelly!

               He storms out of the room.

               Corky looks up at Violet.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm sorry, Corky ...

                                     CORKY
                         Don't be sorry.  Help me.

               She pulls at the ropes as Violet slides off the bed.

               INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Caesar throws open the broom closet and grabs the clippers 
               that Mickey used to cut off Shelly's finger.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The two women are back-to-back, fingers working at each 
               other's knots when Caesar bursts into the room.

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh, no no no.

               Grabbing Corky by the boots, he drags her and flips her so 
               that she can now see Violet.

               He drops down onto Violet putting the clippers in front of 
               her face.

                                     CAESAR
                         Hey, Violet, you remember these?

               Her eyes widen with terror.  She starts to scream when he 
               stuffs a towel in her mouth.

               Laying against Violet, he turns to Corky.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm going to start with her so you'll 
                         get a good idea what's coming.

               He takes hold of Violet's pinky finger, stretching it out.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm going to ask you where the money 
                         is.  Every time you don't give me an 
                         answer, I'm going to cut off one 
                         finger.

                                     CORKY
                         No.

                                     CAESAR
                         When I reach ten, then I'll start 
                         with you.

               He puts the finger between the blades.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where is the money?

               Corky sees Violet thrashing helplessly.  She has no choice.  
               Her mouth opens as --

               The door buzzer rings.

               Caesar is distracted, trying to think who it could be.

                                     CAESAR
                         ...  Mickey.

               He sees the phone, where he dropped it, lying off the hook.

               The door buzzer rings again, more insistently.  Corky sees 
               him momentarily unnerved.

               He looks back at her.

                                     CAESAR
                         I said where --

               He starts to cut and Corky screams --

                                     CORKY
                         No!  I'll tell you!

               He stops, the door buzzing continuously.

                                     CORKY
                         It's over there in the empty 
                         apartment.

               As she speaks, the sound of the door buzzer changes.

                                     CORKY
                         I put it inside one of the paint 
                         drums.

               He is not looking at her; listening, he realizes that Mickey 
               is buzzing the other apartments.

               CAESAR stands as the buzzing stops.  He pulls out his gun 
               and aims it at Corky.

                                     CAESAR
                         I promised I would kill you.

               He cocks it.

                                     CORKY
                         You can't kill me yet.

                                     CAESAR
                         Why?

                                     CORKY
                         I could be lying.

               His hand start to shake with ftustration.  He is beginning 
               to hate this woman more than he ever hated Johnnie.

               Taking a deep breath, he eases back the hammer.

                                     CAESAR
                         You're going to wish to God you hadn't 
                         done that.

               He kicks her again, snapping her head back.

               After he leaves, Violet looks over and sees Corky lying 
               unconscious.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               Caesar tries to open the door to the empty apartment but it 
               is locked.

                                     CAESAR
                         Fuck.

               At the end of the hall, the elevator "dings." Just as the 
               door opens, Caesar jumps back into his apartment.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                                     CAESAR
                         Son of a bitch ...

               His mind a racing blur, he locks the door and runs back to 
               the bedroom.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               With another towel, he gags Corky and drags her into the 
               closet.  In her pocket, he finds the key.

               He closes the doors, then hangs up the phone.

               Grunting, he hauls Violet up over his shoulder --

               When there is a knock on the door.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Carrying Violet, he hurries to the kitchen, where he throws 
               Corky's gun into the freezer.  Mickey is banging on the door 
               as Caesar heads for the bathroom.

               INT.  BATHROOM

               Dropping Violet onto the floor, he reaches behind the curtain 
               and turns on the shower.

                                     CAESAR
                         Mickey will get in.  I know he will.

               We hear the water hitting the bodies while Caesar starts 
               tearing off his clothes.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet.  I can kill you right now if 
                         that's what you want.  If you want 
                         to live, then you have to help me.  
                         I need you to make Mickey believe 
                         that everything is normal.

               He picks up his gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         Tell me, do you want to live?

               She stares hard at him and his gun, then nods.

                                     CAESAR
                         Good girl.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               We move toward the door as the lock clicks open.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Violet's hands are untied.  She pulls off the gag and the 
               ropes at her feet.

               Naked, Caesar sticks his head under the shower spray, wetting 
               everything.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM

               Still dripping, Caesar walks into the room, a towel wrapped 
               around his waist, another towel in his hand.

               Mickey and Lou are standing in the middle of the room.

               Caesar jumps.

                                     CAESAR
                         Jesus Christ!

               Caesar holds his chest, laying it on a bit thick.

                                     CAESAR
                         Holy fuck, Mickey!  You scared the 
                         shit outta me.

               He sees they both are holding their guns.

                                     CAESAR
                         What is this?  what are you two doing, 
                         sneaking in here with your peckers 
                         in your hands?  You gonna do me, 
                         Mick?  Is that it?

               Mickey smiles, putting his gun away.

                                     MICKEY
                         No, Cease.  There was no answer.

                                     CAESAR
                         I thought I heard someone knocking.

                                     MICKEY
                         I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I 
                         guess you couldn't hear me on account 
                         of being in the shower.

                                     CAESAR
                         Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was 
                         so wound up about Gino, she was trying 
                         to help me relax.

                                     MICKEY
                         That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish 
                         someone would help me relax.

                                     CAESAR
                         Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get 
                         you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.

               Behind the bar, he sets down the towel be was holding and we 
               see the gun hidden inside it.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Violet watches through a sliver of open door, her mind already 
               working.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar is making the drinks.

                                     MICKEY
                         We was worried about you, Cease.

                                     CAESAR
                         Me?  Why?

                                     MICKEY
                         We went over to Johnnie's place just 
                         to check it out and it was busted 
                         up, Bad.

               Caesar hands him a drink.

                                     MICKEY
                         I started thinking maybe it's about 
                         the money so I call you, but all I 
                         get is the busy signal.  I figure 
                         the phone is off the hook, that's 
                         why I come rushing over here.

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a 
                         fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't 
                         it?

                                     MICKEY
                         Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, 
                         I'd probably do the same thing.

               Mickey smiles as he sips his drink.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Violet stands and goes to the shower curtain.  She reaches 
               in and turns off the water.  Steadying herself, she pulls 
               back the curtain, exposing the wet, bloody bodies.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Mickey is looking at the furniture.

                                     MICKEY
                         Cease, can I ask you something?

                                     CAESAR
                         Yeah.

                                     MICKEY
                         Why'd you move all the furniture 
                         around?

               The knot in Caesar's stomach tightens.

                                     MICKEY
                         Let me guess.  That was Violet's 
                         idea, too.

               He laughs, and Lou laughs with him.

                                     CAESAR
                         Actually, yeah, she was nervous about 
                         Gino coming, wanted everything to 
                         look right.  You know women, Mick.

                                     MICKEY
                         Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid 
                         things, don't they.

               Caesar smiles feebly.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Violet has pulled up Johnnie's body and is digging through 
               his coat pockets, searching for something.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Mickey sees the briefcase still on the coffee table.

                                     MICKEY
                         Is that the money?

                                     CAESAR
                         Yeah, that's it.

               Caesar puts his hand inside the towel as Mickey walks across 
               the rug.

                                     MICKEY
                         That fucking Shelly.  I gotta hand 
                         it to the guy, but Jesus, if I were 
                         him I would have bailed a long time 
                         ago.  I mean, how much money does a 
                         man need?

               Talking to Lou, be picks up the case and walks back, somehwo 
               moving right between the wet spots.

                                     MICKEY
                         I remember I was just staring at all 
                         this goddamn money, Shelly down on 
                         his knees, and the next thing I know, 
                         Johnnie just blows his head off.

               He slaps the case up onto the bar.

                                     MICKEY
                         What a fucking mess.  Johnnie's 
                         laughing his ass off and that's when 
                         Caesar lost it and - Boom.  He 
                         coldcocked him.  Fucking coldcocks 
                         Johnnie Marzzone.

               He thumbs the latches but the case is still locked.

                                     MICKEY
                         Hey, Caesar, where's the key?

                                     CAESAR
                         The key, yeah, the key's in my pants 
                         in the bathroom.

                                     MICKEY
                         Fuck it, I don't need the key.

               Caesar takes the smallest breath.

                                     MICKEY
                         I didn't need a key to get in here, 
                         did I?

               He pulls out a lock-pick and starts working the lock.  The 
               muscles in Caesar's forearm bulge as he tightly squeezes his 
               gun.

               He is slipping toward that same desperate choice.  He is 
               going to attack when --

               Across the room, the phone rings.

               Everyone looks at it.

                                     MICKEY
                         Who the hell could that be?

               The phone is near the couch.  Caesar doesn't want to let go 
               of the gun.

               The phone continues to ring.

                                     MICKEY
                         You gonna answer it?

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Violet has Johnnie's cellular phone.

               Watching through the cracked door, Violet sees Caesar cross 
               to answer the phone.

                                     CESAR (V.O.)
                         Hello?

                                     VIOLET
                         Hello, Caesar.  This is Gino.

               Caesar looks toward the bathroom.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         What?

                                     VIOLET
                         You're blowing your only chance.  
                         Act like I'm Gino.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar's eyes light up.

                                     CAESAR
                         Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've 
                         been going crazy over here, Gino!

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         Good boy.

               Mickey jumps up.

                                     CAESAR
                         It's Gino!  It's Gino!

                                     MICKEY
                         Where in the hell is he?

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

                                     VIOLET
                         We were in a car accident --

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         They were in a car accident.

                                     VIOLET
                         But everybody is all right.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                                     CAESAR
                         They're all fine.  Just bruises and 
                         shit.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         Now you listen to me, asshole, I 
                         know your gun is behind the bar ...

                                     MICKEY
                         Un-fucking-believable.  I called 
                         those highway patrol dumb fucks.

                                     CAESAR
                         Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         We make a deal or I come out and 
                         hand this phone to Mickey.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm listening.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Violet has her robe over her dress, wrapping her hair in a 
               towel, making sure the bruise on her forehead is hidden.

                                     VIOLET
                         I want what's mine, half the money.  
                         We get rid of Mickey, no one else 
                         dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         Yes, I understand.

                                     VIOLET
                         Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the 
                         Kennedy, in the waiting room, but 
                         stay on the phone until I come out.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         Sure, Gino, sure.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Out of the corner of his eye, he watches Violet come out of 
               the bathroom.

                                     CAESAR
                         St.  Mary's off the Kennedy, sure.  
                         Okay, Gino.

               Mickey sees Violet.

                                     VIOLET
                         Mickey?  What are you doing here?

                                     MICKEY
                         Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They 
                         were in a car accident.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?

                                     MICKEY
                         I think everything is okay.

               Caesar hangs up.

                                     CAESAR
                         They're at St.  Mary's in the waiting 
                         room.

               Mick is already on the way.

                                     MICKEY
                         I can't fit them all in my car so 
                         give me your keys.  You drive my 
                         car, Lou.

               Caesar sees Violet walking toward the kitchen.

                                     CAESAR
                         Sure, Mickey, sure.  Violet!

               She stops, looking straight at the freezer.

                                     CAESAR
                         Go grab my car keys from my pants in 
                         the bathroom.

               She turns to him.

                                     CAESAR
                         Please, help us out, Mickey wants to 
                         get going.

               She turns to the bathroom.

                                     MICKEY
                         They might want to go straight to 
                         the airport and back to Miami, so I 
                         better take this.

               He grabs the briefcase.

                                     MICKEY
                         You got the key?

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh yeah.  Violet!

               INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT

               Where Corky remains bound, still unconscious.  We hear the 
               name echo in her head.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         Violet!

               Suddenly, her eyes blink open.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         Violet!

               Her eyes blink again as she tries to focus.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Violet hands Mickey the keys for the car and the case.

                                     MICKEY
                         Thanks, V.

               He kisses her on the cheek.

                                     CAESAR
                         Call me as soon as you get him.

                                     MICKEY
                         Leave your phone on the hook.

               Mickey and Lou leave.  Violet is staring at Caesar, standing 
               near the door.

               In his right hand he is holding the other towel.  He smiles.

                                     CAESAR
                         Now that's teamwork.

                                     VIOLET
                         I should have let him kill you.

                                     CAESAR
                         You know he would have done you, 
                         too.

                                     VIOLET
                         I knew I couldn't trust you.

               He drops the towel, raising the gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         I said I'd let you live and I will.

               He smiles again.

                                     CAESAR
                         Maybe.

               INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT

               Corky is wide awake, thrashing-mad, biting her gag, struggling 
               to get free.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar pulls his pants on.

                                     CAESAR
                         Time to find out if the dyke was 
                         stupid enough to lie.

               Caesar drags Violet througb the front door.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The closet doors burst open as Corky fights her way out.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Caesar sees the buckets of paint.

               He rips the lid from the nearest and kicks it over.  Paint 
               spills out across the floor.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Suddenly Corky stops; something has caught her eye.  We drop 
               down, focusing on what she is staring at --

               The clippers.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               He kicks over the second bucket and the bag tumbles out with 
               the rushing flow of paint.

                                     CAESAR
                         Yes!

               He turns to Violet, who is already running out the door.

                                     CAESAR
                         No!

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               Violet turns down the hall, bare feet beating against the 
               floor.

               Caesar slices out of the room behind her.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet!

               He aims the gun as she hurls her self into the emergency 
               door.

                                     CAESAR
                         Fuck!

               INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT

               She flies, hands on the rail, spiraling down each flight as 
               he charges after her.

                                     CAESAR
                         Goddammit, Violet!  Stop!  Now!

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Straining, Corky's fingers curl around the handle of the 
               clippers.

               INT.  LOBBY - NIGHT

               Violet smashes through the door, but instead of turning to 
               the main doors, she runs straight for the elevators.

               She pounds the button and waits.

                                     VIOLET
                         Come on.  Come on, please.

               She hears Caesar coming just as the elevator opens.

               Caesar crashes out of the stair door, running toward the 
               exit.  When he doesn't see Violet, he turns to the sound of 
               the elevator --

               And catches a glimpse of her as the doors close.

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh, you bitch.  You fucking bitch.

               Taking a really deep breath, he throws open the door to the 
               stairs.

               INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               Violet takes Johnnie's cellular phone from the robe pocket 
               and dials a number.

               Mickey answers on the car phone.

                                     VIOLET
                         Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!

                                     MICKEY (V.O.)
                         Violet?

               Whispering, she acts terrified.

                                     VIOLET
                         He made me help him, Mickey, God, I 
                         was so afraid.  It was Caesar, all 
                         Caesar.  You have to help me.  He's 
                         coming - Oh God!

               She hangs up, eyes blazing.

               INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT

               Sweat pouring off him, Caesar climbs the stairs.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               The elevator opens, Violet bolts out.  She runs down the 
               hall, past the empty apartment, back to her door.

                                     VIOLET
                         Corky?

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               She rushes to the bedroom, where she finds the coils of cut 
               rope.

                                     VIOLET
                         Corky!

               She looks at the wall separating the apartment.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               Caesar half-falls out of the stair door, drenched with sweat.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT

               Gun ready, Caesar throws open the door.

               Spread out like a pond of milk is the spilled paint, but --

               The money is gone.

               Leading away from the white pool are boot prints and the 
               drip trail of the plastic bag.

               The tracks lead to the bathroom.

               Caesar kicks open the bathroom door and finds the bag of 
               money next to Corky's empty boots.

               Over his shoulder we see Corky already swinging a massive 
               pipe wrench.

               At the last second he is able to duck, falling to the ground 
               as --

               The doorjamb splinters with a terrible metal crunch.

               Before he can recover and shoot, she brings the wrench down 
               on his arm.

               He screams as the gun hits the floor.

               She kicks it, sending it skidding, hydroplaning across the 
               paint pool to the other side, leaving a jet trail of white 
               swirls and spirals on the wood floor.

               They fight, Corky raining blows onto his back and flailing 
               arm until --

               He catches her foot, flipping her as he clambers up.

               Scrambling across the paint, slipping, crawling for the gun 
               when --

               Violet bursts in, pointing the gun from the freezer.

                                     VIOLET
                         Stop!

               Caesar, on hands and knees, looks at her, then at his gun 
               still out of reach.

                                     VIOLET
                         It's over, Caesar.  I called Mickey.  
                         He's on his way.

               Violet stands for long time, the gun trained carefully on 
               him as he rises from the floor.

               Panting, Caesar watches her like a mad dog.

                                     VIOLET
                         Get out of here, Caesar.  If you 
                         want to live you had better start 
                         running.

               He smiles.

                                     CAESAR
                         All these years and you still don't 
                         know me, Violet.

               She glances down and sees the paint-covered gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         But I know you.

               He turns to the gun.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, don't.

                                     CAESAR
                         What are you going to do, V?  Shoot 
                         me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't 
                         think so.  I'll tell you why.  If 
                         you had it in you to pull that 
                         trigger, you would have done it a 
                         long time ago.  If I was you, I would 
                         have killed me the minute I brought 
                         the money home.  But you didn't and 
                         I know why, because you don't want 
                         to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you?  
                         No, I know you don't.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, you don't know shit.

               Violet fires --

               The bullet hits Caesar in the shoulder, knocking him off 
               balance.  Another doubles him over as blood speckles the 
               pool of paint.

               She empties the gun into him.  His body arcs back, falling, 
               splashing into the paint.

               Caesar's blood bubbles out bright red against the glistening 
               white.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - DAY

               It is empty and clean.  In the bedroom, only a few hangers 
               are left dangling in the open closet.

               EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY

               Mickey is standing with Violet, next to his Lincoln Town 
               Car.

                                     VIOLET
                         I will never understand it, Mickey.  
                         You didn't even call the police.

                                     MICKEY
                         I told you, the family doesn't want 
                         the police around.  We want to take 
                         care of it ourselves and we will.  
                         I'll find him.  I swear I will.

                                     VIOLET
                         I know you will.

                                     MICKEY
                         Sure you're going to be okay?  I 
                         mean, if you're having second 
                         thoughts, my offer still stands.

                                     VIOLET
                         Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get 
                         out, you know?  Get away from all of 
                         this.

               Mickey nods.

                                     VIOLET
                         But thanks.  Thanks for everything.

               She hugs him and he kisses her.  Then he gets in his car.  
               Violet watches him drive away and knows that she is free.

               EXT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT

               Corky sitting on stoop, patient, like a rock.

               She looks up as she hears high heels, and smiles at --

               Violet standing there, new outfit.

               Corky stands in front of her.

                                     CORKY
                         Hey.

                                     VIOLET
                         Hey.

                                     CORKY
                         How'd it go?

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm here, aren't I?

               Corky nods.

                                     CORKY
                         I guess we should get out of here.

               Violet nods.

               Corky digs out alarm keys, aims, fires.  Violet turns, looks.

               New truck.

               Violet turns to Corky, eyebrow cocked.

                                     CORKY
                         Thought we might need a getaway car.

               Smiles, they get in.

               INT.  TRUCK

               Corky admires truck.

                                     CORKY
                         You know what the difference is 
                         between us, Violet?

                                     VIOLET
                         No.

                                     CORKY
                         ...  Me neither.

               Lean for kiss, as dolly in.

               Guns engine.

               Zoom.

              

               THE END
