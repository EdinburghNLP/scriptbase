     THE TITLES appear on black. They are intercut with CLOSE-UPS
     of a fighter's body.
     
     EXAMPLES:
     
     Feet move.
     
     Credit over black.
     
     Body lunges.
     
     Credit over black.
     
     Fists swing and punch at the air.
     
     Credit over black.
     
     WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of young JAKE LAMOTTA.
     
                                        THEN CUT TO:
     
     INT. BARBIZON PLAZA THEATRE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT (1964)
     
     JAKE LAMOTTA, wearing a tux, is shadow-boxing.
     
     We are unsure of where he is -- he moves in and out of the
     shadows. At 42, he's overweight and out of shape, but the
     balls of his feet still pop up and down like they were on
     canvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward with short
     bursts of light. He is rehearsing a nightclub monologue.
     
                    JAKE
          Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
          It's a thrill to be standing here
          talking to you wonderful people. In
          fact, it's a thrill to be standing!
          I haven't seen so many people since
          my last fight at Madison Square
          Garden. After that fight, a
          reporter asked me, 'Jake, where do
          you go from here?' I said, 'To a
          hospital!' I fought one hundred and
          six professional fights and still
          none of them bums figured out how
          to fight me -- they kept hitting me
          in the head! And that's why I'm
          here tonight...
               (starts to sing)
          'When the fighter's not engaged in
          his employment, his employment,
          although he was Champ and quite the
          rage, he must go somewhere else to
          seek employment, seek employment.
          But a fighter's life is not a bowl
          of cherries, still I'd rather have
          an egg than a fist upon my face...
          That's Entertainment!'
     
     INT. CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT (1941)
     
     Bam! JIMMY REEVES, a fast, black middleweight, jabs LAMOTTA,
     19 years old, in the face. JAKE staggers forward. No matter
     how hard LAMOTTA is hit, no matter how often, he always
     staggers forward -- like a bull. The bell sounds.
     
     Battered, JAKE slumps on the stool in his corner.
     
     It's September, 1941. Europe and Asia are already at war.
     Young SOLDIERS, freshly recruited, dot the hostile audience --
     each screaming at the FIGHTERS in the ring.
     
     Suddenly, words are exchanged, a GIRL screams, and a SOLDIER
     and a CIVILIAN stand and start swinging.
     
     AND IN THE RING: JAKE LAMOTTA takes a swig of water and spits
     blood into the bucket his younger brother, JOEY, holds for
     him. TONY, his trainer, works the cuts.
     
                    JOEY
          You didn't have to come to
          Cleveland to get beat by a "moulan
          yan," Jake!
     
                    TONY
          He's got you, Jake! You're
          outpointed! You're coming up for
          the tenth. You gotta knock him out!
     
     The bell sounds for the tenth. JAKE pulls himself up and
     charges at REEVES.
     
     REEVES slides away, jabbing, punching, piling up points.
     
     In JAKE's corner, JOEY stands and yells at JAKE:
     
                    JOEY
          A grand apiece! We got a grand
          apiece on this, Jake! A fucking
          grand!
     
     JAKE suddenly corners REEVES and unleashes a desperate, wild
     alley-fighting attack. One ferocious punch after another.
     
     The SPECTATORS go wild; everyone's up for the kill.
     
     REEVES staggers, then falls to the canvas.
     
     The REFEREE counts:
     
                    REFEREE
          One, two, three, four...
     
     The GAMBLERS call out new odds; ten to one for REEVES, the
     underdog. JOEY, excited, sees that time is running out and
     steps in front of the bell. He swings his arms, pretending
     not to realize he literally holds back the TIMER's arm for a
     few seconds. This gives JAKE more time for a knockout -- but
     not enough. JOEY is pushed back and the bell rings at the
     count of nine, ending the match.
     
     Boos and cheers. The BETTORS scramble back to the BOOKIE to
     get their money.
     
     JAKE dances around the ring, kissing his gloves and thrusting
     them toward the CROWD. JOEY rushes out and hugs him.
     
     The ANNOUNCER steps into the ring with the mike:
     
                    ANNOUNCER
          Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner,
          under the rules of the Cleveland
          Boxing Commission, after ten
          rounds, by a decision -- Jimmy
          Reeves.
     
     The ANNOUNCER holds up REEVES' arm as his corner tries to
     lift him off the canvas -- still out cold. TWO ATTENDANTS
     bring in a stretcher.
     
     JAKE is stunned. He still prances around, now trying to
     figure out what happened. He raises his arms in victory, and
     the FANS go crazy, cheering, ripping chairs out, fighting
     with the COPS, throwing bottles and junk into the ring.
     PEOPLE go into the ring.
     
                    JOEY
               (to Jake)
          Don't get out of the ring. You won
          the fight -- let him go out first.
     
                                        CUT TO:
     
     REEVES being placed on the stretcher.
     
     A ringside OFFICIAL signals the ORGANIST and she starts to
     play the "Star Spangled Banner." REEVES is carried out.
     
     Only then do JOEY and TONY escort JAKE out of the ring.
     
     EXT. WEBSTER AVENUE AND 169TH ST., THE BRONX - NEXT DAY
     
     It's a rough neighborhood, inhabited primarily by welfare
     cases and street kids.
     
     In the street, two young PUNKS, 13 or 14 years old, exchange
     words and start to fight. Their FRIENDS cheer them on. SALVY
     and JOEY turn the corner.
     
                    JOEY
          Salvy, would I steer you wrong?
          Let's say that's the truck; it's
          full of cigarettes, right? Now, two
          o'clock this morning we move the
          truck from here to there,
               (he points; the CAMERA
               PANS)
          take the cigarettes out, sell 'em,
          make some cash.
     
                    SALVY
          Hey but Joey, you're thinking
          nickels and dimes. The money's with
          your brother.
     
                    JOEY
          What do you want from my life,
          Salvy? He's my brother.
     
                    SALVY
          He ain't doin' the right thing.
          He's makin' beans compared to what
          he should be makin'. Can't you make
          him understand that?
     
     A COP goes over and starts to break up the fight.
     
                    JOEY
               (to cop)
          Hey, leave the kids alone.
     
                    SALVY
          Get lost.
               (joking, he knows the Cop)
          Hey kids, "A cop is a rat."
          Remember that, "A rat."
     
     The KIDS yell.
     
                    JOEY
               (to Cop)
          Hey Jimmy, here's a dollar for your
          trouble. There's some bums around
          the corner -- they need your help.
     
                    COP
          Keep the dollar, Joey. Get yourself
          a new suit.
     
                    JOEY
               (laughs)
          Here's my new suit.
               (grabs his crotch)
          Right here.
     
                    COP
          Hey, don't get wise!
     
                    JOEY
          Just kidding, take it easy.
               (to himself)
          No fuckin' sense of humor.
     
     SALVY and JOEY continue to walk a little faster, giggling.
     
     INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S KITCHEN - DAY
     
     JAKE, bandaged from the REEVES fight the night before, sits
     at the kitchen table (he's had a few glasses of wine) while
     his wife, IRMA, 19, cooks at the stove.
     
     JAKE gets up and pokes at the frying steak with a fork.
     
                    JAKE
          This looks done.
     
                    IRMA
          It's not done.
     
                    JAKE
          It looks done. I'll take it the way
          it is.
     
                    IRMA
          Here's your steak. You can't wait
          for it to be done. Here.
     
     She slams the steak onto his plate, and reaches back to the
     stove.
     
                    IRMA (CONT'D)
          Here's your carrots. You're in such
          a hurry. You can't wait.
     
                    JAKE
          No, I can't wait. You know when I
          wait? When it's important to wait.
          It's not important to wait for no
          steak. It's important to wait for
          Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't
          important to wait for no steak! I
          won that fight. So, I stayed in the
          ring, and that way I made sure
          everybody knew it. I shoulda
          knocked him out earlier,
          sonofabitch.
     
     He starts to eat the steak. He takes a drink of wine.
     
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Wait! I'll wait. But let me tell
          you, if this steak was the
          middleweight championship, I'd show
          you how I'd wait. I'd eat it raw.
          I'd drink the blood. I'd eat it
          before it came out of the cow --
          that's how I'd wait.
     
     EXT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT BUILDING/TENEMENT - DAY
     
     SALVY and JOEY approach the building.
     
                    JOEY
          I can't convince him. He's got such
          a thick head, I'd like to crack it
          open myself. Believe me, my own
          brother. It's very hard. You don't
          have to convince me -- I know we
          should be with Tommy. You talk to
          him. He don't listen to nobody.
     
                    SALVY
          Look, I'm just tellin' you how
          Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard
          on himself. Tommy wants him with
          us. It's as simple as that.
     
     They stop at the doorway.
     
                    SALVY (CONT'D)
          Talk some sense into him, will ya?
          You're still his brother.
          If he ain't gonna listen to you, he
          ain't gonna listen to nobody!
     
                    JOEY
          All right, I'll try. See you later.
     
                    SALVY
          Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
     
                    JOEY
          Right, the gym.
     
     SALVY leaves. JOEY goes into the building.
     
     INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S KITCHEN - DAY
     
     JOEY is knocking at the door. IRMA opens it.
     
                    JOEY
               (noticing Jake)
          What's the matter?
     
                    IRMA
          He's doing it again.
     
                    JOEY
               (goes to Jake)
          What's the matter? You're drinking.
          You're eating like an animal.
     
     JOEY sits next to JAKE at the kitchen table. JAKE has a drink
     in his hand, and tears on his face.
     
                    JOEY (CONT'D)
          What's wrong?
     
                    JAKE
               (gets up)
          Nothing...
     
     JAKE goes into the living room. IRMA looks at JOEY. JOEY
     follows JAKE.
     
     INT. LIVING ROOM
     
     JOEY walks up to JAKE.
     
                    JOEY
          Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
     
                    JAKE
               (privately, to Joey)
          I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis,
          that's what's the matter.
     
                    JOEY
          What're you talking about? He's a
          heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
     
     JAKE holds out his scarred hands.
     
                    JAKE
          Look at these hands. These fuckin'
          hands. I was born with a girl's
          hands. And even if I put on enough
          weight to be a heavyweight, I'd be
          too slow to fight. No matter how
          big I get, I'll never be big enough
          to fight Louis.
     
     JAKE pauses. IRMA watches from the doorway.
     
                    JOEY
          That's what I'm sayin'. You
          shouldn't even think like that.
          It's crazy.
     
                    JAKE
          I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll
          never be big enough to fight Louis,
          but I know Joey, I know...
     
                    JOEY
          You know?
     
                    JAKE
          Yeah. Do me a favor.
     
                    JOEY
          Sure. What is it?
     
                    JAKE
          Hit me in the face.
     
                    JOEY
               (after a pause)
          You want me to do what?
     
                    JAKE
          You heard me, I said hit me.
     
                    JOEY
          C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
     
                    JAKE
          Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your
          best shot. On the jaw.
     
                    JOEY
          Jack, I got no gloves.
     
                    JAKE
               (grabs a nearby towel)
          Here's your glove.
     
     JOEY wraps it around his fist. IRMA watches. JOEY hits JAKE
     with his right. JAKE holds fast.
     
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Go ahead. Hit me. C'mon, don't
          worry about it. I want you to hit
          me with everything you got.
     
     JOEY hauls off and lands him a real belt. JAKE rolls with it
     and stands firm.
     
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Again. Harder.
     
     JOEY hits him again.
     
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Harder. Go 'head.
     
     JOEY hits him again.
     
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Harder.
               (grabs the towel)
          Take the towel off.
     
                    JOEY
          Jack! Enough!
     
                    JAKE
          Go ahead.
     
     JOEY hits him again. JAKE holds fast. JAKE starts to walk
     away.
     
                    JOEY
          What was that for? I know you can
          take punches. I can hit you from
          now to doomsday. What the fuck does
          that prove?
     
                    JAKE
          See that, I don't feel it. I can
          take it. I know I can take anybody.
     
     EXT. GLEASON'S GYM - NEXT DAY
     
     Gleason's, a small gym and fight club, stands on 149th Street
     and 3rd Avenue above a small sandwich shop.
     
     Each day BOBBY GLEASON posts a small sign alongside the door
     listing the fighters who will be working out. JAKE's name is
     posted at the top; the other names are unmemorable.
     
     INT. GLEASON'S - DAY
     
     Gleason's has a single sparring ring and ten training bags.
     About a dozen managers train their fighters out at Gleason's.
     For 50 cents, spectators sit in the gallery and watch the
     workouts.
     
     JAKE is sparring with JOEY in the ring. They've been working
     out for a while now. The bell rings ending the third round.
     JAKE prances about the ring waiting for the bell to sound
     again.
     
     At that moment, SALVY, along with two other young "BUTTON"
     MEN (actually, they are very young -- about JOEY's age) enter
     the gym. They are well-dressed (over-coat, ties, suits,
     flashy rings, etc.). They say hello to some PEOPLE by the
     door. JAKE looks over and notices them. SALVY looks over to
     the ring.
     
                    SALVY
               (waves)
          Hey Joey --
     
     JOEY waves back.
     
                    SALVY (CONT'D)
               (waves again)
          Jake, how you doin'?
     
     JAKE nods to SALVY very cold. SALVY notices and can feel that
     he's not exactly wanted there by JAKE. JOEY notices the same
     and becomes a bit nervous.
     
     SALVY sits down near the ring but not as close as he'd like
     to. His two friends, FRANKIE and GUIDO, sit nearby also.
     
     JAKE goes to JOEY's corner.
     
                    JAKE
          Did you know they were coming up
          here?
     
     JOEY doesn't answer.
     
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Answer me when I talk to you.
     
                    JOEY
          Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to
          talk to you. So I...
     
                    JAKE
               (interrupting)
          Don't ever bring those kids up here
          again! I'm working out, I'm killin'
          myself in here, and they walk
          around like they fuckin' own the
          neighborhood.
     
     SALVY and the OTHERS see JOEY being chewed out by JAKE. They
     begin to feel unwelcome at the gym.
     
     The bell sounds. JAKE is more aggressive now as he corners
     JOEY. JAKE swings away with body punches. JOEY can't block
     them. SALVY and the OTHERS watch.
     
     The bell sounds again. With that, SALVY and the OTHERS start
     to leave.
     
                    SALVY
               (to Joey)
          Hey Joey, we better go. See you
          later.
     
     JOEY, dazed, turns to wave.
     
                    JAKE
          Go 'head. Wave goodbye. They're
          your friends.
     
     JAKE watches them leave.
     
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he
          think he is? I'm gonna let that
          fuckin' hard-on come up here and
          act like a big shot.
     
                    JOEY
          What are you getting so hot about --
          Tommy Como told him to come down
          here...
     
                    JAKE
               (interrupting)
          Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como.
          I don't care about Jesus Christ on
          the fuckin' cross. I gotta give
          them a percentage of what I make!
          I'm in here breaking my ass, not
          them. Don't ever bring them up here
          again.
     
                    JOEY
          I didn't tell them to come. Tommy
          Como...
     
     The bell sounds again. JAKE hits JOEY a few more solid body
     punches. JOEY gets angry and fights back with a flurry of
     punches which have no effect on JAKE. JAKE laughs.
     
                    JAKE
          That's right, fight back. I got
          laid three times before I came up
          here this morning and I can still
          break your ass.
     
     JOEY fights back, but it's no use.
     
                    JOEY
          You cocksucker.
     
     JAKE laughs. The two continue to swing it out, as SALVY
     watches unseen from the doorway.
     
     EXT. SHOREHAVEN POOL - DAY (1942-43)
     
     The Shorehaven Pool, spic-and-span in the summer sun is the
     closest thing to a country club in the Bronx. An eight foot
     fence stands between the pool and the street.
     
     JAKE, wearing slacks and a sportshirt, hangs out with the
     "BOYS" near the bar area. Older, "MADE" MEN play cards. A
     young FAN walks by and says:
     
                    FAN
          Hey, Jake.
     
     At the opposite end of the pool where the GIRLS gossip, and
     sunbathe, JOEY swaps small talk with VICKIE, a school girl,
     about 15. VICKIE is a knockout.
     
     SALVY, FRANKIE and JUNIOR are with VICKIE and her FRIENDS.
     They joke with JOEY.
     
     JAKE watches SALVY and VICKIE.
     
     JAKE'S P.O.V.: JOEY is talking (PAN) to VICKIE. VICKIE
     giggles. JOEY stands and walks over to JAKE.
     
                    JAKE
               (referring to Vickie)
          Who's that?
     
                    JOEY
          Whadda you care?
     
                    JAKE
          Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who
          is she? What's a matter? You afraid
          I'm gonna take her on you?
     
                    JOEY
          No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna
          meet her?
     
                    JAKE
          Yeah --
     
                    JOEY
          Cause I'll go right over there and
          bring her here.
     
                    JAKE
          Go 'head.
     
                    JOEY
          You sure you wanna meet her? Don't
          make me go over there, you change
          your mind and you make me look bad,
          cause she's really a knockout.
          She's 15, this kid -- a great piece
          of ass.
     
                    JAKE
          How do you know? You know her that
          good?
     
                    JOEY
          No, I see her around the pool. I
          know her. I know her like that --
          not like that.
     
                    JAKE
               (gesturing to his bandage)
          Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I
          don't feel right...
     
     JAKE watches VICKIE.
     
     INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT
     
                    JOEY
               (to Jake)
          I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I
          know she'll be there.
     
                    JAKE
          'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
     
                    JOEY
          How you gonna catch anybody alone
          at a dance?... I don't know if
          she'll be there alone... She'll
          probably be there with her
          girlfriends or something.
     
                    JAKE
          She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
     
                    JOEY
          Nah, she don't go with nobody.
          She's only 15 years old.
     
                    JAKE
          What does that have to do with it?
          She don't look 15 to me. I heard
          somethin' with Salvy. She was with
          him once or somethin', I think. It
          was like some blonde. That's the
          one...
     
                    JOEY
          Probably. You know she talks to
          everybody, and not just him.
     
                    JAKE
          Yeah, she's nice.
     
                    JOEY
          Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin'
          you.
     
                    JAKE
          You wasn't with her, were you?
     
                    JOEY
          Huh?
     
                    JAKE
          You wasn't with her?
     
                    JOEY
          With her? How?
     
                    JAKE
          You know, like bang her or
          anything?
     
                    JOEY
          Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I
          know her from around here, that's
          all. You want to meet her or what?
     
                    JAKE
          Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons
          around. I'll wait. Not now.
     
     The scene ends on VICKIE as JAKE watches her.

                    JOEY
               (to Jake)
          I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I
          know she'll be there. Dressed up
          and everything.
     
                    JAKE
          I don't like all those other clowns
          around. That's all I know.
     
                    JOEY
          C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna
          get outa here tonight.
     
     JOEY sips a drink as JAKE knots his tie. IRMA enters from the
     bedroom.
     
                    IRMA
          Where you going at this hour?
     
                    JAKE
          What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out --
          business.
     
                    IRMA
          You fuckin' worm, if you're going
          out, I'm going out.
     
                    JAKE
          And where you goin'?
     
                    IRMA
          None of your fuckin' business.
     
     JOEY lifts his eyes up.
     
                    JAKE
          Eh, go out. Do what you're gonna
          do. What do I care?
     
     JOEY opens the door to leave. JAKE follows.
     
                    IRMA
          That's right -- run out. I ain't
          gonna be here when you get back.
     
     INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT
     
     JAKE and JOEY hurry down the stairs. IRMA shouts after them.
     
                    IRMA
          Bunch of guys. You all hang out
          together. Yeah, you're all going
          out on business. You're all gonna
          suck each other off.
     
     INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - LATE NIGHT
     
                    JOEY
          What a mouth on her -- you shoulda
          hit her -- no good fuckin' Jewish
          cunt -- breakin' our balls. You
          shoulda hit her with a chair.
     
                    JAKE
          Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk
          like that. She's still my wife.
     
                    JOEY
          No, but Jake... how much abuse can
          you take.
     
                    JAKE
               (interrupting)
          How many times do I have to hit
          her? I hit her enough.
     
     They exit to street.
     
     EXT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - STREET - LATE NIGHT
     
     JOEY and JAKE come out of the building and start walking down
     the street.
     
     IRMA opens the window on the second floor right above them,
     and shouts out to them:
     
                    IRMA
          Go ahead -- that's all you're good
          for -- to go out and leave me here
          like a dog. You and your brother!
          You don't even look like brothers.
          You look like faggots! That's what
          you look like -- faggots!
     
     JAKE and JOEY walk faster down the block, pretending that
     IRMA must be shouting at someone else.
     
     She throws a bottle at them. It smashes in the street.
     
     EXT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT (AN HOUR LATER)
     
     ESTABLISHING SHOT.
     
     INT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT
     
     A neighborhood dance is in progress. A small BAND is playing
     while mainly OLDER COUPLES dance. There are TWO PRIESTS
     present. The younger people are divided into two groups --
     the BOYS, who are dressed in suits and ties, and spend most
     of their time at the bar area -- and the GIRLS, who are in
     evening dresses, and spend most of their time dancing
     together.
     
     Some of the more popular GIRLS are surrounded by "WISE-GUYS."
     There are tables near the dance floor with "set ups" (bottles
     of Scotch, rye, and a bucket of ice) on them. These tables
     are the "bases of operation" for different neighborhood
     groups, as if they were street corners.
     
     JAKE and JOEY are walking toward a table. VERA, a young
     neighborhood girl, blocks their way as she bends over to talk
     to some GUYS at a table. VERA's well-built, and knows it.
     
     JOEY tries to move one way; VERA again blocks his way. This
     little game goes on for a few seconds, then:
     
                    JOEY
          Look, could you move a little.
          Would you mind, darling?
     
                    VERA
          Mind what, Mr. Big Shot?
     
                    JAKE
               (annoyed)
          Eh, girlie, take a walk.
     
     JAKE starts to move forward; JOEY stops him.
     
                    JOEY
               (to Vera)
          All right, darling, I'll just stand
          here and wait.
     
     JOEY cups his hands and grabs VERA's breasts. VERA squeals,
     covers her breasts, and moves back. JOEY and JAKE walk past
     her. JOEY smiles.
     
     JOEY and JAKE sit down at an empty table.
     
                    JAKE
          Do you see her yet?
     
                    JOEY
          Give me a chance. Let me look.
     
     MOVING SHOTS
     
     JAKE tries to find her -- Camera pans until we find her. JOEY
     points out a distant table. He spots VICKIE with a couple of
     other GIRLS . VICKIE locks beautiful and is obviously having
     a good time.
     
                    JOEY (CONT'D)
          THERE she is over there on the
          other side. What did I tell you?
          Oh, ain't she nice? Ain't she a
          fuckin' doll?
     
     As they watch, WE SEE, from JAKE's POV:
     
     SALVY, FRANKIE, and JUNIOR show up at VICKIE's table. They
     are in overcoats and hats and don't sit down. They are
     obviously on their way to bigger things than a neighborhood
     dance -- and VICKIE and her GIRLFRIENDS are glad to go with
     them. They get up to leave.
     
                    JAKE
          Be right back.
     
     SALVY, FRANKIE, JUNIOR, VTCKIE and the other TWO GIRLS leave
     the dance hall. JAKE, unseen, follows them to the entrance
     way, as they go out onto the sidewalk.
     
     EXT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT
     
     JAKE watches as SALVY ushers everyone into his Cadillac, and
     then drives off.
     
     JAKE stares after the car for a moment, then goes back
     inside.
     
     EXT. SHOREHAVEN POOL - DAY (1942-43)
     
     JAKE and JOEY get out of their Packard convertible and walk
     over to the fence surrounding the pool. VICKIE is by the
     pool.
     
                    JOEY
               (calling out to Vickie)
          Hey, Vickie, c'mere. Don't be
          afraid. C'mere. Just say hello.
          This is my brother.
     
     VICKIE comes over to the fence.
     
                    JOEY (CONT'D)
          Vickie, I want you to meet my
          brother, Jake. He's gonna be the
          next champ.
     
     JAKE puts his fingers through the fence.
     
                    JAKE
          Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is
          that right? You wanted to meet me?
     
                    VICKIE
               (to Joey)
          I just wanted to say hello.
     
                    JAKE
          You wanted to say hello, eh? I
          can't believe it. When did you fall
          outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you
          you're the most beautiful one here,
          princess of the pool. You got a
          baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha
          wanna meet me for?
     
                    VICKIE
          I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
     
                    JAKE
               (to Joey)
          Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face
          is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now?
          You wanna go for a ride?
     
     PAN to car.
     
                    VICKIE
          Sure. Gimme a few minutes.
     
     She starts to go.
     
                    JAKE
          Hey...
     
     She turns. JAKE kisses his hand and holds it up to the fence
     by her lips.
     
     EXT. SHORE ROAD - DAY
     
     JAKE drives his Packard convertible down Shore Road. VICKIE
     sits in the passenger seat, her blonde hair blowing in the
     wind. VICKIE feels JAKE's eyes all over her, and loves it.
     
     On the radio, Bing Crosby sings "Just One More Charce."
     
     EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - DAY
     
     JAKE parks across the street from the new miniature golf
     course on Shore Road. The Shore Road course is one of the
     best. The first green features a pink windmill.
     
     JAKE and VICKIE get out to cross the street.
     
                    VICKIE
          You don't talk very much.
     
                    JAKE
          I ain't ever talked to a movie star
          before.
     
                    VICKIE
               (giggles)
          I ain't no movie star. I'm just in
          high school.
     
                    JAKE
          Oh no? I thought you was a movie
          star.
     
     A bus heads toward them.
     
                    VICKIE
          Jake! The bus!
     
     JAKE holds up his hand.
     
                    JAKE
          Any bus gives you trouble, I knock
          it out for ya.
     
     The bus stops for them as they cross the street.
     
     EXT. THE FIRST GREEN - DAY
     
     JAKE sets VICKIE's ball on the tee facing the windmill.
     
                    VICKIE
          You go first. Let me watch how to
          do this.
     
                    JAKE
          You don't get nothin' done by
          watchin'. You just gotta do it.
          Here, I'll help you.
     
     JAKE hands VICKIE the putter, then moves behind her and puts
     her hand on the club.
     
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          That's it. Just grip up a little
          tighter. That's it. You're gonna be
          real good at this. How does that
          feel?
     
                    VICKIE
          It feels real good.
     
                    JAKE
          Just keep your eye on the ball.
     
                    VICKIE
          Should I hit it?
     
                    JAKE
          Just give it a nice little tap.
     
     VICKIE swings and the ball rolls into the center of the
     windmill. VICKIE breaks free and follows her ball. JAKE
     follows.
     
                    VICKIE
          I can't find my ball.
     
                    JAKE
          Can you see it?
     
     VICKIE bends and looks under the windmill.
     
                    VICKIE
          No.
     
     JAKE bends and looks.
     
                    VICKIE (CONT'D)
          Can you see it?
     
                    JAKE
          No.
     
                    VICKIE
          What does that mean?
     
     JAKE takes VICKIE by the arm.
     
                    JAKE
          It means the game is over.
     
     JAKE throws his putter on the next green.
     
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Let's get outa here.
     
     EXT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDING - BRONX - DAY
     
     JAKE and VICKIE pull up to a tenement.
     
     JAKE dashes around the car to open the door for VICKIE.
     
     They enter the building.
     
     INT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY
     
     JOSEPH LAMOTTA, SR. is finishing his Sunday dinner with a
     glass of wine as JAKE and VICKIE enter.
     
                    JAKE
          Hi Pop. This is my new girlfriend,
          Vickie. V for victory. How do you
          like that Pop?
     
                    JOE LAMOTTA
          V for victory.
     
                    VICKIE
               (nervous)
          It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr.
          LaMotta.
     
                    JOE LAMOTTA
               (in Italian)
          Sit down. Eat something.
     
     JAKE is anxious. VICKIE is scared.
     
                    JAKE
          C'mon, Pop. You've been in America
          so many years. Speak English.
     
                    JOE LAMOTTA
               (joking)
          You want me to speak English --
          Fuck you. That's English.
     
                    JAKE
          Pop, don't curse. There's a girl
          here. I'm gonna show her around the
          house. Why don't you just finish
          your wine?
     
     JOE stares at him. JAKE grasps VICKIE's arm firmly.
     
     INT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY
     
     The bedroom is a few rooms away from the kitchen. JAKE closes
     the door. (There is a warm light in the bedroom.)
     
                    VICKIE
          Jake, this is your father's
          bedroom.
     
                    JAKE
          That's all right. He don't mind.
     
     The room is sparsely furnished. On the bureau, there is a
     large framed photo of the boxing brothers: JAKE and JOEY
     LAMOTTA. (JOEY wears a suit in the picture.)
     
     JAKE puts VICKIE on the bed and removes his jacket and tie.
     
                    VICKIE
          Jake...
     
                    JAKE
          It's OK.
     
     He pushes her against the bed and gently undresses her. They
     make love.
     
     INT. OLYMPIA STADIUM - DETROIT (FEB. 5, 1943)
     
     JAKE is fighting SUGAR RAY ROBINSON. (It's their 2nd match.)
     WE SEE highlights of the fight: JAKE is fighting ferociously,
     but SUGAR RAY is a formidable opponent. AN ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
     gives a blow by blow description. JAKE takes a lot of
     punishment from SUGAR RAY -- until the 8th round. Then, JAKE
     nails SUGAR RAY with a savage left. JAKE chases SUGAR RAY and
     pounds him with a left and a right. SUGAR RAY gets in a right
     cross. They stand toe to toe, fighting. Then, JAKE lands a
     left to SUGAR RAY's stomach, and knocks him through the
     ropes. JAKE goes after SUGAR RAY, but the REFEREE stops him.
     SUGAR RAY gets back into the ring and sinks to one knee,
     while the REFEREE counts to 9. The bell sounds.
     
     TIME CUT: THE ANNOUNCER calls out that JAKE is the winner.
     JAKE throws kisses. The CROWD goes wild.
     
     INT. GLEASON'S - DAY (1943)
     
     JAKE's press conference.
     
     FIVE REPORTERS meander around the gym, waiting for JAKE to
     finish sparring. They are not thrilled with their assignment.
     JAKE is not thrilled with having them there.
     
     The gallery is spotted with the usual BRONX TYPES. The lone
     exception is VICKIE, dressed very well, very sensual, and
     quite content to watch JAKE make his SPARRING PARTNERS' lives
     miserable, despite their head and belly protectors.
     
     JOEY is off in one of the corners arguing with ONE of the
     REPORTERS:
     
                    JOEY
          The fuckin' papers are full of
          Robinson and nothing on Jake -- and
          Jake knocked him clear outa the
          ring in Detroit. He's the only guy
          ever to beat Robinson. Whatsa
          matter with you? I thought we had
          an arrangement.
     
                    REPORTER
          We do Joey. You know we do.
     
                    JOEY
          You holding me up for more cash or
          what?
     
     The bell sounds, ending the sparring round.
     
                    REPORTER
          I can't print nothing if Jake won't
          give me nothing.
     
     JOEY walks over to the ring. The REPORTER follows not far
     behind.
     
                    JOEY
          C'mon, Jake. You're makin' us look
          stupid. I brought these guys up
          here, now you don't wanna talk to
          them? What are ya doin'? Open your
          mouth, for Christsake.
     
     JAKE nods his head, steps out of the ring, and goes directly
     over to the REPORTER, who is about to say: "Hi, Jake."
     
                    JAKE
               (interrupting)
          I'm tallin' you now, when I read
          this, it better not make me look
          bad.
     
                    REPORTER
          Jake, did I ever make you look bad
          before?
     
                    JAKE
          Maybe it wasn't you, but you know
          what I'm talkin' about.
     
                    JOEY
               (interrupting)
          Don't worry. Don't worry. It's
          gonna be all right.
               (to reporter)
          Ask him your questions.
     
                    REPORTER
          All right, Jake, you're being
          talked about as the top
          middleweight contender. Do you
          think another victory over Sugar
          Ray will get you a shot at the
          title?
     
                    JAKE
          Why not? There's nobody else around
          who wants to fight me; they're all
          afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't
          have a shot at the title right now.
     
                    REPORTER
          Well, the word is to get a title
          shot you have to cooperate with the
          people who control boxing, in New
          York. And they're saying that you
          don't cooperate.
     
                    JAKE
          You guys know more about that than
          I do. I just fight...
     
                    JOEY
               (interrupting)
          He fights the toughest guys around
          that everybody else is afraid to
          fight...
     
                    JAKE
               (interrupting)
          I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar
          Ray, and I still don't have a shot
          at the title.
     
                    REPORTER
          You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks
          ago and you're training like this
          right now... Are you afraid Sugar
          Ray might beat you this time?
     
                    JAKE
          I tell you what. You hit me here.
               (points to his right
               cheek)
          Sugar Ray hits me here.
               (points to his left cheek)
          I can't tell the difference. I just
          fight.
     
     JAKE turns to VICKIE, smiles, and prepares for his next
     SPARRING PARTNER.
     
     INT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY (FEB. 1943)
     
     JAKE, wearing pleated dress slacks, sits on the edge of the
     bed examining his muscle tone.
     
     He studies his small fists. Squeezes each knuckle. Twists his
     wrists. Clenches. Unclenches.
     
     VICKIE steps out of the bathroom wearing a nightie and
     panties.
     
                    VICKIE
          Are you sure we should be doing
          this?
     
                    JAKE
          Come over here.
     
                    VICKIE
          You said never to touch you before
          a fight.
     
                    JAKE
               (lovingly)
          If you let me do it, I'll murder
          you. Come here.
     
                    VICKIE
          You said I couldn't. You've been
          good for two weeks...
     
                    JAKE
          Come here.
     
     JAKE watches VICKIE approach him. He respects her as he would
     a shrine; he slowly removes her sheer nightie.
     
     His round hands caress her smooth skin. He glides his bruised
     knuckles across her shoulders, pride on his face.
     
     She kisses his bruised knuckles sensuously, then his bruised
     face.
     
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Take off my pants.
     
                    VICKIE
          Jake...
     
                    JAKE
          Do what I say.
     
     He touches her breasts as she removes his trousers.
     
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Now take the rest off.
     
                    VICKIE
          Jake, you made me promise not to
          get you excited.
     
                    JAKE
          Go 'head. Do it.
     
     She pulls off his shorts. VICKIE is now getting excited. She
     kisses his chest and licks it.
     
                    VICKIE
          I like the gym smell.
     
                    JAKE
          Now take your panties off.
     
     She does.
     
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Now, touch me...
               (takes her hand)
          ... here.
     
                    VICKIE
          Oh, Jake.
     
     She caresses his broad shoulders and runs her hand along his
     erection.
     
     JAKE's lips are trembling. He quickly turns his back on
     VICKIE, goes into the bathroom, and gets a full glass of cold
     water.
     
     VICKIE watches as he puts his erection in the glass of cold
     water. She is shocked and surprised.
     
                    JAKE
          I can't do it. I can't fool around.
          This Robinson, I gotta beat him
          again. I can't fool around. Don't
          come near me.
     
     JAKE grabs her again and kisses her. Then, gently but firmly,
     he turns her around and pushes her out. (It's starting again,
     and he must stop it.) He goes back the bathroom and closes
     the door.
     
     INT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - DETROIT (FEB. 26, 1943)
     
     This is JAKE's rematch with SUGAR RAY (their 3rd fight). AN
     ANNOUNCER's VOICE gives a blow by blow description.
     
     THE FOURTH ROUND: JAKE is in serious trouble. SUGAR RAY
     knocks him with a hard right, then a series of rights and
     lefts. JAKE is punched all the way across the ring, but stays
     in there.
     
     THE SEVENTH ROUND: JAKE, coming on strong, forces SUGAR RAY
     into his own corner, then lands a left hook to his chin.
     SUGAR RAY drops, and takes a nine count. This time, however,
     the blow does not have a crippling effect on SUGAR RAY;
     instead, he comes back and outboxes JAKE.
     
     TIME CUT: THE ANNOUNCER calls out the decision: SUGAR RAY is
     the winner. JAKE is stunned. The CROWD boos so loud and for
     so long that THE ANNOUNCER is unable to introduce the
     fighters in the next bout.
     
     INT. OLYMPIA STADIUM - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     JOEY and TONY are in the dressing room. JAKE sits on the
     table, dejected. His hand is being examined by a DOCTOR. TWO
     HANGERS-ON are also present.
     
                    JOEY
               (angry)
          They robbed us! Those fuckin'
          judges -- What the fuck fight were
          they watching? If I see them on the
          street, I'll break their heads.
          Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass!
          Those judges give him the decision
          'cause he's goin in the army next
          week! How else could this have
          happened?... What do you think they
          gave him the decision for, that's
          why.
     
                    JAKE
               (almost to himself)
          Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked
          him down. What did I do wrong? I
          don't understand.
     
                    JOEY
          You won and was robbed! You didn't
          do nothin' wrong.
     
                    JAKE
          I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to
          win. I've done a lot of bad things.
          I dunno...
     
     TONY goes to the door.
     
                    JOYE
          Fuck that. This was the fight. This
          coulda done it. This was our shot.
          They out and out robbed us.
     
     MARIO comes back from the door.
     
                    MARIO
          Vickie is here, Jake.
     
                    JAKE
          I don't wanna see nobody.
     
                    JOEY
          You want us to wait for you?
     
                    JAKE
          No, take her home. I wanna be alone
          for a while. Everybody go.
     
     They exit.
     
                                        DISSOLVE TO:
     
     INT. BATHROOM NEAR THE DRESSING ROOM
     
     JAKE, now alone, goes into the bathroom. He looks in the
     bathroom mirror. After a pauseg, he touches his newly
     acquired bruises and bandages. He combs his hair.
     
     We hear the beginning of an early Frank Sinatra song. This
     song carries over onto the following MONTAGE.
     
     MONTAGE
     
     This MONTAGE covers the period between 1943 and early 1947.
     It shows JAKE hard at work fighting all the tough guys he
     can. Each of the fights will be introduced by the
     corresponding title card from the "Big Fights" film showing a
     boxing glove with the fighters' names and the places of the
     fights superimposed on it. The actual fight images will be
     black and white newspaper photos JUMP CUT together to
     simulate real action. For example: In still #1 JAKE is about
     to land a punch on an OPPONENT.
     
                                        CUT TO:
     
     Still #2, and the punch lands, distorting the OPPONENT's
     face, sweat spraying out everywhere. Live sound effects
     accompany these stills.
     
     The fight stills are INTERCUT with 16mm black and white home
     movies of JAKE, VICKIE, JOEY, etc. (to be shot in 16mm black
     and white).
     
     It'll go something like this:
     
     A) JAKE VS. FRITZIE ZIVIC at the Detroit Olympia (January 14,
     1944)
     
     B) JAKE, VICKIE, and JOEY, wearing sunglasses, pose in front
     of a Cadillac. (1944)
     
     C) JAKE VS. SUGAR RAY ROBINSON at Madison Square Garden
     (February 23, 1945)
     
     D) JAKE and VICKIE getting married. (This will be a black and
     white still photo, posed especially for the occasion.) (1945,
     
     New Jersey courthouse)
     
     E) JAKE VS. SUGAR RAY ROBINSON at Comiskey Park, Chicago
     (September 26, 1945)
     
     F) JAKE and VICKIE on vacation -- very loving. They are
     dancing, and he allows her to knock him into the pool. Then,
     JAKE gives VICKIE a present by the poolside. She opens the
     box and takes out a white garment and turban. She kisses
     JAKE.
     
                                        CUT TO:
     
     VICKIE dressed in the outfit. She looks very much like Lana
     Turner in "The Postman Always Rings Twice." She kisses JAKE.
     (1946)
     
     G) JAKE VS. JIMMY EDGAR at Detroit (The University of Detroit
     Stadium) (June 12, 1946)
     
     H) JOEY's marriage. JAKE and VICKIE are there as witnesses.
     (Could also be a still photo as D was.) (1946)
     
     I) JAKE VS. BOB SATTERFIELD at Wrigley Field, Chicago
     (September 12, 1946)
     
     J) JAKE and VICKIE in front of their new Pelham Parkway
     house. It is an affluent, split-level house, an idyllic scene
     -- stone terrace, freshly cut lawn, etc. JAKE carries VICKIE
     inside.
     
                                        CUT TO:
     
     JAKE and VICKIE with their two boys JACK, age 2, and JOEY,
     age 1 in the backyard of the Pelham Parkway house; they are
     having a cookout. JOEY and his WIFE and their two children (a
     BOY and a GIRL about the same ages as JAKE's) are there also.
     (1947)
     
     K) JAKE VS. TOMMY BELL at Madison Square Garden (March 14,
     1947)
     
     INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE (1947)
     
     WE SEE an early model, round screen television. Nearby an old
     radio. On it, Sinatra is finishing the song we heard in the
     preceding montage.
     
     JAKE enters, and turns down the volume on the radio. WE SEE
     JAKE's living room; it is late forties modern.
     
     JOEY and VICKIE are seated around the coffee table, which is
     near the television. There are some remnants of a snack on
     the table. JAKE's TWO BOYS are playing nearby.
     
                    JAKE
               (to Joey as he turns down
               the radio)
          I just weighed myself - I'm 161. No
          more deals like this Janiro
          bullshit. I didn't tell you to do
          it in the first place.
     
                    JOEY
          Jake, you're the one who said you
          could get down to 155! What did I
          do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
     
                    JAKE
               (angry)
          Well, sometimes you shouldn't
          listen to me! Now I don't know if I
          can make it down to 155. I'm having
          trouble making 160, and without
          telling me, you sign me for a fight
          at 155 pounds, and if I don't make
          155, I forfeit $15,000! You're
          supposed to know what you're doin'.
          You're supposed to be a manager!
     
                    JOEY
          You want the title shot?
     
                    JAKE
          Say what you're gonna say.
     
                    JOEY
          You want the title shot or not?
     
                    JAKE
          Say what you gotta say. Don't be a
          smart ass.
     
                    JOEY
               (yelling)
          This Janiro's an up-and-coming
          fighter, this kid you gotta knock
          out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm
          telling you, this is your step
          towards getting a shot at the
          title. Listen to me: I'm telling
          you. You been killin' yourself for
          three years. There's nobody left --
          they're afraid to fight you.
          This Janiro's up-and-coming. He
          don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart,
          wipe him out! What are you worried
          about? Your weight? Look, even if
          you lose they're gonna think you're
          weak; they're gonna think you're
          not the fighter you used to be.
          They'll match you with guys they
          were afraid to match you with
          before, and then you'll kill them
          and you'll get your title shot. And
          if you beat this kid Janiro, they
          gotta give you a shot at the title
          because there's nobody else. Either
          way you win and you do it on your
          own -- just like you want it. All
          right?
     
                    VICKIE
          Joey's right. Janiro's up-and
          coming, he's good looking...
     
                    JAKE
               (interrupting)
          What do you mean, "good looking?"
     
                    VICKIE
          Well, he's popular. A lotta people
          like Janiro. You beat him and it
          only figures they'll wanna see you
          get a title shot. But, what do I
          know? I should keep my mouth shut,
          I should...
     
                    JAKE
               (interrupting)
          Who asked you?
     
                    VICKIE
          But, Jake, I was just...
     
                    JAKE
               (interrupting)
          Who asked you?
     
                    VICKIE
          I was just...
     
                    JAKE
               (interrupting)
          Who asked you?
     
     VICKIE, amazed, gets up to leave.
     
     JAKE glares at her.
     
     VICKIE rounds up the kids and takes them into the kitchen.
     (MOVING SHOT).
     
     WE SEE VICKIE in the kitchen angrily throwing things around.
     We clearly see the tension as she cleans up, muttering to
     herself.
     
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
               (turns to Joey)
          All right, manager. Everybody had
          their say around here. Now this is
          what I'm gonna say. I'm gonna get
          down to 155, and I'm gonna destroy
          this kid -- get my title shot. And
          don't ever bet 15 thousand without
          my sayso again.
     
     JAKE comes into the kitchen. He tries to make up with VICKIE.
     She plays hard-to-get. They begin to tease each other.
     
     INT. COPACABANA LOUNGE - NIGHT (1947)
     
     A COMEDIAN is in the middle of his act. JAKE, VICKIE, JOEY,
     and JANET sit at a nearby table. JANET, an attractive blonde,
     is are of JOEY's girlfriends; the moment you set eyes on her,
     you know this is not his wife.
     
     The lounge is very crowded. The COMEDIAN interrupts his
     routine to point out that JAKE LAMOTTA is in the audience,
     and even tries a little harmless joking at JAKE's expense.
     
                    COMEDIAN
          Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to
          point out a special guest we have
          with us tonight -- The Raging Bull,
          The Bronx Bull, Mr. Jake LaMotta.
     
     There is applause. JAKE smiles, and gives a hesitant wave.
     
                    COMEDIAN (CONT'D)
          Stand up, Jake, c'mon. Oh, you are
          standing. Sorry.
               (laughs)
          Just kiddin', Jake.
     
     JAKE waves a fist at the COMEDIAN, good-naturedly playing
     along with the joke -- even though he hates it.
     
                    JAKE
               (to Joey)
          Look at this abuse I gotta take.
     
     JOEY, VICKIE, and JANET are amused.
     
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
               (joking)
          What's so funny?
               (lifting his glass)
          Cheers! Post-time. Joey, Vickie,
          and...
               (to Janet)
          What's your name again, darling?
     
                    JANET
          Janet.
     
     JAKE Smiles. They all drink.
     
     SALVY, a little older, but still young-looking, and dressed
     even better than when we last saw him (flashy rings, etc.),
     comes over to their table. He walks around like he owns the
     fucking place. JAKE hates it.
     
                    SALVY
          Hi, Joey. Jake, how you doin'?
          Vickie...
     
     They respond. JAKE is cold towards SALVY.
     
     SALVY goes on his way to COMO's table.
     
     As SALVY walks away, JAKE turns to VICKIE.
     
                    JAKE
          What're you lookin' at? You lookin'
          at him?
     
                    VICKIE
          No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
     
                    JAKE
          Don't tell me "No." I saw you
          lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
     
                    VICKIE
          I'm not interested in him.
     
                    JAKE
          You're not interested in him?
     
                    VICKIE
          No, I'm not.
     
                    JAKE
          In other words, you're not
          interested in him but you'd be
          interested in somebody else, right?
     
                    VICKIE
          Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
     
                    JAKE
               (turns to Joey, referring
               to Salvy)
          Look at this, all of a sudden
          everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around
          here. Did you see the way she was
          lookin' at him?
     
                    JOEY
          Nah, she would never...
     
                    JAKE
               (interrupting)
          Didn't you just see her lookin' at
           him? She told me no, but I don't
           believe her.
     
                     JOEY
                (uncomfortable)
           C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy
           about you.
     
     JAKE gives him a suspicious look. JOEY feels uneasy.
     
                     JAKE
           I'd just love to catch her. Oooooh,
           I'd just love to catch her once.
     
     Drinks arrive at their table.
     
                     WAITER
           These are from Tommy Como.
     
     JAKE looks up but can't see where COMO is. JOEY gets up.
     
                     JOEY
                (to Jake)
           Excuse me for a minute. Be right
           back.
     
                     JAKE
                (sarcastic)
           Don't be long. I'm afraid with all
           these tough guys here.
     
     JOEY goes to COMO's table in the rear of the lounge. JAKE
     slides over and watches. JOEY shakes hands with COMO. SALVY
     is there at COMO's table. JOEY comes right back.
     
                     JOEY
           Jake, come over for a few minutes.
           Tommy wants to say hello to you.
           C'mon, just come and say hello.
     
     JAKE doesn't like the idea, but goes along with it anyway.
     
     ANOTHER ANGLE: COMO's table. JAKE comes over.
     
                     JAKE
           Hi, Tommy. How are you?
     
                     TOMMY
           Jake, sit down for a minute.
     
     JAKE sits. SALVY smiles and nods to JAKE. JAKE barely nods
     back.
     
                     TOMMY (CONT'D)
                (his arm around Jake)
           Fuckin' kid! You're the best
           fuckin' fighter around. Loved what
           you did to Satterfield. Them
           "moulan yans" -- forget about it.
           They're all afraid to fight you.
     
                     JAKE
                (a little embarrassed)
           C'mon, Tommy --
     
                     TOMMY
           How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin'
           good?
     
                     JAKE
           Never felt better.
     
                     TOMMY
           Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
     
                     JAKE
           He should.
     
                     TOMMY
                (to Salvy)
           This Janiro's a good fiahter,
           pretty good-lookin' kid.
     
                     SALVY
           Bet on him three times. Always come
           through for me.
     
     JAKE just stares, holding his anger in.
     
     There is a pause.
     
                     TOMMY
           How's the weight? Ok?
     
                     JAKE
           Yeah, the weight's Ok.
     
     Another pause. TOMMY smiles and moves closer to JAKE.
     
                     TOMMY
           All right, lemme ask you something.
           Let's say I was a good friend of
           yours. And I was telling you I was
           gonna bet a lot of money on you in
           this Janiro fight. What would you
           tell me?
     
                     JAKE
           I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
     
     TOMMY sips his drink.
     
     INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     VICKIE is in bed trying to sleep. JAKE comes out of the
     bathroom half-dressed, and sits on the edge of the bed
     (preoccupied). Silence.
     
                     JAKE
           Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
     
                     VICKIE
           What?
     
                     JAKE
           You asleep?
     
                     VICKIE
           Yeah.
     
                     JAKE
           Huh?
     
                     VICKIE
           Yeah, what?
     
                     JAKE
           Tell me, you think of anybody else
           when I'm making love to you?
     
                     VICKIE
           Nobody. I love you, remember?
     
                     JAKE
           Then why'd you say that thing about
           Tony Janiro?
     
                     VICKIE
           What did I say?
     
                     JAKE
           That he's got a pretty face.
     
                     VICKIE
           I never noticed his face.
     
                     JAKE
           You sure you're not thinking of him
           right now?
     
                     VICKIE
           Positive.
     
                     JAKE
           You're the one who said he was good
           looking. You think he's good
           looking 'cause I know you think
           he's good-looking. I'll smash his
           face inside out. I'll make him into
           dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's
           good-looking when I get through
           with him. So you just go ahead and
           think about who you want.
     
     VICKIE freezes.
     
     INT. WORTH STREET BASEMENT - DAY
     
     TONY JANIRO, wearing boxer trunks, steps off the scale.
     Commissioner COL. EDDIE EAGAN, a white-haired, heavyset man
     in his mid-forties, calls out the weight.
     
     The basement of the New York Boxing Commission on Worth
     Street is a sparse room, crowded with REPORTERS, TRAINERS and
     MANAGERS.
     
                     EAGAN
           Tony Janiro, 151 lbs. and one half.
     
     JAKE steps on the scale. He looks weak and woozy. After the
     customary adjustments, EAGAN calls out:
     
                     EAGAN (CONT'D)
           Jake LaMotta, 155 lbs. and one
           fourth.
     
     There's a commotion in JAKE's camp. JANIRO smiles.
     
                     JAKE
           Just a minute.
     
     JAKE, JOEY, and TONY confer.
     
     JAKE gets off the scale and enters the men's room. An
     OFFICIAL follows him.
     
     INT. THE MEN'S ROOM
     
     JAKE forces himself to urinate.
     
     INT. WORTH STREET BASEMENT
     
     JAKE comes out of the bathroom, and gets back on the scale.
     
                     EAGAN
           Ok. This is official.
     
     LAMOTTA stares at JANIRO.
     
                     EAGAN (CONT'D)
           LaMotta, 155 lbs. on the nose.
     
     JAKE throws JANIRO a kiss.
     
     INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
     
     It's the last round and JAKE is pouring it on a beaten and
     virtually helpless JANIRO.
     
     The CROWD chants:
     
                     CROWD
           LaMotta.
     
     HALF THE AUDIENCE is already on its feet. The kill is
     imminent -- and they love it.
     
     JAKE lands one blow after another. He is relentless.
     
     Several rows back, TOMMY COMO, SALVY and SEVERAL OTHER "MADE"
     GUYS sit with sober looks on their faces.
     
     JAKE moves in fast, and with a powerful barrage, smashes
     JANIRO's nose -- plastering it against his left cheek.
     
     The final bell rings. JANIRO, his legs all rubber, staggers
     back to his corner.
     
     JAKE prances about, kissing his fists and throwing them to
     the CROWD. JOEY rushes out, throws JAKE's leopard skin robe
     over him and embraces him. TONY follows. JAKE looks right at
     COMO and SALVY.
     
     AN ANNOUNCER steps into the center of the ring:
     
                     ANNOUNCER
           The winner, by unanimous decision,
           in ten rounds, Jake LaMotta!
     
                     JOEY
           I love you.
     
     JAKE, weak from losing the weight and winning the fight,
     still manages to prance around the ring victoriously.
     
     VICKIE, now near the ring, throws kisses to JAKE.
     
                     JAKE
                (shouts to Vickie)
           This is my night! Listen to them!
           I'm gonna be champ!
     
     He bends down and gives her a kiss through the ropes.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           I'm making everything up to you.
     
     INT. COPACABANA - NIGHT (1947)
     
     JOEY is at the bar with a DETROIT PROMOTER and JACKIE CURTIE.
     
                     DETROIT PROMOTER
           When we gonna get Jake back in
           Detroit? Jesus, he really did a job
           on Janiro. Who you after next,
           Joey?
     
                     JOEY
                (evasive)
           I dunno. We're working on it. He's
           training at the camp now.
     
                     JACKIE CURTIE
           After what I seen, they gotta give
           him a shot at the title.
     
                     JOEY
           We're gonna get our shot.
     
     The DETROIT PROMOTER introduces JOEY to JACKIE CURTIE.
     
                     DETROIT PROMOTER
           Oh Joey, this is Jackie Curtie. He
           handles a lot of business in South
           Ohio.
     
                     JACKIE CURTIE
           I like your brother. Made a lot of
           money on him.
     
                     JOEY
           Betcha more than he has.
     
                     JACKIE CURTIE
           Made a little cabbage on the Tommy
           Bell fight too. Whatever happened
           to him?
     
                     JOEY
           Ain't he dead?
     
                     DETROIT PROMOTER
           Nah. He's got a job downtown. Runs
           an elevator in some building.
     
                     JOEY
           Yeah?
     
                     DETROIT PROMOTER
           Went down to see him the other day.
           I says, "Tommy, take me up to the
           fifth floor." And you know, he took
           me right up there. 
     
                     JACKIE CURTIE
           Yeah, Tommy always was a stand-up
           guy.
     
     SALVY and PATSY arrive with VERA, SANDY (two neighborhood
     girls), and VICKIE. They go to a nearby table.
     
     The bar area: JOEY sees this.
     
                     DETROIT PROMOTER
           Joey, let me get you another drink.
     
                     JOEY
                (distracted)
           Just a minute. Excuse me. I'll be
           right back.
     
     The table area: JOEY arrives at SALVY's table. VICKIE is
     nervous. There is a cold exchange of'"hellos."
     
                     JOEY (CONT'D)
                (to Vickie)
           C'mere, let me talk to you for a
           minute.
     
     There is an awkward silence as he grabs VICKIE by the arm and
     takes her over to the hat-check area.
     
                     JOEY (CONT'D)
           What're you doin' with Salvy? You
           shouldn't be here with him. Jake's
           away killin' himself. Suppose he
           found out.
     
                     VICKIE
           What the hell am I doing wrong?
           Just because Jake is training, I
           can't go out? What am I, a goddamn
           prisoner?
     
                     JOEY
           No, you're his wife.
     
                     VICKIE
           I'm not doing anythina wrong. I'm
           just trying to have a good time. Do
           I have to be cooped up in the house
           all the time?
     
                     JOEY
           It don't look right.
     
                     VICKIE
           Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's
           gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter
           of time.
     
                     JOEY
           I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but
           if he finds out, he will kill you.
           What's the matter with you? Aren't
           you happy? You got everything you
           want.
     
                     VICKIE
           You don't sleep with him. I do. I
           don't get to breathe without
           tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage.
           If he thinks I'm lookin' at
           somebody the wrong way, I get used
           as a punching bag. He don't trust
           nobody. If he saw the two of us
           talking together right now, you'd
           be in trouble too -- believe me.
           Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old.
           I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake,
           but you don't know. He gets crazy
           sometimes. I'm scared.
     
                     JOEY
           Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's
           got a lotta aggravation. He's been
           a top contender too long.
     
                     VICKIE
           That's right, take his part. You're
           his brother. He's never gonna be
           champ. Too many people are against
           him.
     
                     JOEY
           And you're drinking with them right
           now.
     
                     VICKIE
           And I'm gonna finish my drink. And,
           I'm gonna have a good time, because
           I ain't doing nothing wrong.
     
     She starts to go back to the table.
     
                     JOEY
                (grabbing her)
           You're wrong to be here. Let's go.
     
     VICKIE pulls away from JOEY, and goes back to the table.
     
     The table area: JOEY arrives at the table. He grabs VICKIE.
     
                     JOEY (CONT'D)
           I said, let's go.
     
                     SALVY
           Joey, relax. You're taking this the
           wrong way. Why don't you sit down
           and have a drink?
     
                     JOEY
           Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister
           in-law.
     
                     SALVY
           Excuse me for living.
     
                     JOEY
           What do you think, I'm blind? My
           brother's breaking his ass in a
           ring, and you're here with his
           wife.
     
                     SALVY
           Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and
           Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just
           happened to come along. We're just
           trying to have a good time. What do
           you want from me? So, why don't you
           just take it easy before this gets
           out of hand.
     
     As the conversation gets louder, PEOPLE begin to notice.
     PAUL, the owner (a tough-looking, well-dressed guy), and some
     BOUNCERS also become aware of the argument.
     
                     JOEY
           Get the fuck outa here. What did
           you do, take your gangster pills
           today? I'll tear your fuckin' head
           off your shoulders!
     
     JOEY goes for SALVY. PEOPLE react.
     
     The GIRLS begin to scream. VICKIE exits. JOEY notices her
     leave, and calls after her.
     
                     JOEY (CONT'D)
           Hey, wait --
     
     PAUL comes over and stops the fight.
     
                     PAUL
           Ain't you forgettin' something?
           Ain't there never supposed to be no
           trouble in this joint?
     
     SALVY and JOEY give each other looks. JOEY goes out after
     VICKIE.
     
     EXT. COPACABANA - NIGHT
     
     JOEY looks up the street for VICKIE. She is gone.
     
     SALVY and PATSY come out of the entrance.
     
                     SALVY
           Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die
           young?
     
                     JOEY
                (as he turns and lashes
                into Salvy and Patsy)
           I'll suck your eyes out! I'll
           fuckin' take the two of you.
     
     After a few moments, PAUL and the BOUNCERS from the Copa come
     out. The BOUNCERS pull PATSY away. They try to separate SALVY
     and JOEY, but can't.
     
     JOEY savagely beats SALVY on the Copa steps and in the street
     against the parked cars.
     
                     JOEY (CONT'D)
           Fuckin' low-life, cocksucker, etc.
           ...
     
     SALVY tries to fight back, but JOEY is too tough for him.
     SALVY hits the pavement. JOEY kicks him.
     
     PAUL, PATSY, and the BOUNCERS finally pull JOEY away. PATSY
     tries to go after JOEY again, but PAUL stops him.
     
                     PATSY
                (to Paul)
           Don't fuckin' put your hands on me!
           You're gonna near about this, Paul.
     
                     PAUL
                (to Patsy)
           Get the fuck outa here. Don't come
           in my place and start fuckin'
           trouble -- I don't care who you
           are!
                (to Joey)
           Get outa here. Go on.
     
     JOEY looks back at him, and then walks away.
     
     INT. THE BACK ROOM OF THE DEBONAIR SOCIAL CLUB
     
     The room is furnished with a few round tables and some
     chairs; it is somewhat reminiscent of an old-fashioned candy
     store.
     
     TOMMY COMO, SALVY, PATSY and JOEY are present. SALVY's face
     is bruised from the beating JOEY gave him.
     
                     COMO
           All rightg I don't have to hear any
           more. I think I understand what
           happened. I understand it was your
           brother's wife and there was
           probably a misunderstanding. I'm
           not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have
           acted the way he did. But, Joey,
           you don't raise your hands. You
           don't do that kind of thing. This
           time we forget about it but no more
           after this. You understand?
     
                     JOEY
           Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
     
                     COMO
           All right, you guys, shake hands.
     
     SALVY, JOEY, and PATSY shake hands.
     
                     COMO (CONT'D)
           Go 'head. Be friends. That's it.
                (to Salvy and Patsy)
           All right, lemme be alone with him
           for a minute.
     
     SALVY and PATSY exit.
     
     There is a pause.
     
                     COMO (CONT'D)
           Aside from everything else, your
           family all right?
     
                     JOEY
           Yeah, they're good. They're good,
           Tommy.
     
                     COMO
           What is it with you? Can't you
           talk? You got like a funny
           attitude. I can't figure you out,
           Joey. What's with you and the quick
           answers? You wanna get outa here
           fast?
     
                     JOEY
           Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
     
                     COMO
           Look Joey, I wanna tell you
           something.
           Your brother ain't gonna get
           nowhere without us -- nowhere. And
           I'm tellin' you between the two of
           us, it's gettin' to the point where
           it's gettin' to be a real
           embarrassment to me, a real
           embarrassment.
     
                     JOEY
           How can he embarrass you?
     
                     COMO
           He's an embarrassment because
           Frankie and the other guys are
           expectin' me to do something about
           it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I
           can't deliver a kid from my own
           neighborhood. Why's he make it so
           hard on himself? He comes to me, I
           can make it easier for him.
     
                     JOEY
           Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't
           even say hello to anybody else --
           you know that. But you know when
           Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus
           Christ Almighty could get off the
           fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna
           talk him out of it. I'm his kid
           brother. I got no say with Jake on
           this. He thinks he can buck
           everybody and make it on his own.
     
                     COMO
           Make it on his own? Does he know
           the kind of money involved? I mean
           the real money. He thinks he's
           gonna become champ on his own?
           We're gonna sit by and see some nut
           come in there and hold one of the
           most important titles in the world?
           A nut who don't listen to nobody or
           respect nobody? Is he really crazy?
           Listen, Joey, you understand, you
           tell him. I don't care how great he
           is or how colorful. He could beat
           all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all
           the Janiros he wants to. He ain't
           gonna get a shot at the title
           without us. I'm not askin' you to
           do another thing except get that
           message into that thick head!
     
     EXT. SHORERAVEN POOL - DAY
     
     Another day. JOEY, fully clothed, opens the gate and looks
     around.
     
     JAKE is sitting alone near the deep end. JOEY walks over to
     him.
     
                     JOEY
           Whatcha doin'?
     
                     JAKE
           I remember the first time I met
           Vickie... I know there's somethin'
           up. I know she's doin' somethin',
           but I can't catch her...
     
                     JOEY
           Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit
           her so she can't talk to you the
           way she wants to.
     
                     JAKE
           What do you mean?
     
                     JOEY
           Try talkin' to her. She's your wife
           -- ask her what's the matter.
     
                     JAKE
           When I'm away, did you ever notice
           anythin' funny with her? Tell me
           the truth.
     
                     JOEY
           Jack, if there was anything funny,
           I would tell you.
     
                     JAKE
           I want you to keep an eye on her
           when I'm not here. Understand?
     
                     JOEY
           Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
     
                     JAKE
           What did Tommy say?
     
                     JOEY
           I got good news, and I got bad
           news. The good news is you got your
           shot at the title. The bad news
           is...
     
                     JAKE
                (interrupting, resigned)
           Yeah, I know.
     
     INT. WORTH STREET BASEMENT - DAY
     
     As BILLY FOX steps off the scales, EDDIE EAGAN calls out:
     
                     EAGAN
           Billy Fox, 173 3/4 pounds.
     
     JOEY removes JAKE's leopard-skin robe as he steps on the
     scale. The REPORTERS crowd around.
     
                     EAGAN (CONT'D)
           Jake LaMotta, 167 pounds.
     
     JAKE'S HANDLERS urge him with words of encouragement as they
     walk toward his dressing room.
     
     INT. JAKE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY
     
     EAGAN walks over.
     
                     JAKE
           What's up, Colonel?
     
                     EAGAN
           I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
     
                     JOEY
           Sure.
     
                     EAGAN
           I suppose you heard what
           everybody's been saying, Jake.
     
                     JAKE
           What who's been sayin'?
     
                     EAGAN
           You were a big favorite in this
           fight. Then two days ago the odds
           start jumping all over the place
           until you're a 12-5 underdog.
     
                     JAKE
           I don't follow no gamblin'
           Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
     
                     EAGAN
           Now the fight's off the books
           altogether.
           Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet
           down on this fight. Some people are
           saying you're going into the tank.
     
                     JAKE
           Believe what you want.
     
                     EAGAN
           I want to believe you, LaMotta.
     
                     JAKE
           I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin'
           jig's gonna wish he never came outa
           the jungle. You got any money?
     
                     EACAN
           What?
     
                     JAKE
           You got any money you want to bet
           on Billy Fox, you can put it right
           here...
                (extends his hand)
           'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down
           for nobody.
     
     EAGAN taps JAKE on the shoulder.
     
                     EAGAN
           That's all I wanted to hear.
     
     JAKE glares at EAGAN as the COMMISSIONER walks away.
     
     INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT (NOV. 14, 1947)
     
     The old Garden is packed. The EX-CHAMPS, the PRESS, the
     OFFICIALS, the MOB GUYS, the FANS -- they're all here.
     
     The FIGHTERS are announced. BILLY FOX and JAKE touch gloves
     and return to their corners.
     
     FOX is taller and has a longer reach than JAKE.
     
     The bell sounds and the FIGHTERS come out. FOX goes to the
     head; JAKE goes to the body.
     
     FOX lands a solid blow to JAKE's jaw, but LAMOTTA is unfazed.
     FOX is surprised. In the past, his opponents have gone down
     when he connected.
     
     In the audience, COMO, SALVY, and some other BOYS watch with
     interest.
     
     JAKE moves in with a rapid series of trademark body blows.
     All of a sudden, FOX is wobbly. JAKE goes for the head, then
     cuts his punch short. FOX is about to go down.
     
     JAKE throws his arms around FOX to make sure he doesn't fall.
     
                     JAKE
                (to Fox)
           Stand up! What the fuck are you
           doin'?
     
     The REFEREE breaks them apart and FOX remounts his attack.
     JAKE bicycles into a corner and lets FOX work him over.
     
     FOX connects: once, twice, three times. JAKE barely defends
     himself -- but he doesn't go down either.
     
     The CROWD starts to smell a fix. There are calls from the
     AUDIENCE.
     
                     CROWD
           Got your swimming trunks on, Jake?
           I hope they're paying you enough.
           Fake, fake.
     
                                         TIME CUT:
     
     JAKE's corner. JAKE is acting stunned. TONY, not aware of
     what's going on, is slapping JAKE.
     
                     TONY
           What's the matter with you? What's
           the matter with you?
     
                                         TIME CUT:
     
     The sign reads "Round Four." JAKE is in the center of the
     ring taking a relentless pasting from FOX. JAKE's arms hang
     at waist level... FOX lands one blow after another. The stink
     of a fix permeates the arena.
     
     JAKE is furious that FOX can't deck him. He curses through
     his mouthpiece (as he absorbs blow after blow):
     
                     JAKE
           Hit me! Hit me! What's the matter
           with you, you motherfucker? Hit me!
     
     Boos and catcalls echo through the Garden. This is not even a
     fight. The REFEREE, realizing this, steps in between FOX and
     LAMOTTA, waves his arms and signals that FOX is the winner by
     a technical knockout.
     
     As he does, JAKE spits his mouthpiece in disgust at FOX and
     struts back to his corner.
     
     JAKE, JOEY, and TONY are already on their way out of the
     arena as the REFEREE declares FOX the winner.
     
     COMO and the OTHERS, satisfied, get up to leave.
     
     INT. JAKE'S DRESSING ROOM - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
     
     As a REPORTER and a PHOTOGRAPHER come through the door, WE
     SEE and hear a commotion in the hall behind them. They rush
     in, look, and stop by the door. There is silence -- except
     for JAKE'S uncontrollable sobbing. The atmosphere is like
     that of funeral.
     
     JAKE is seated behind the rubbing table. He is still in his
     leopard-skin robe. His head hangs low as he sobs.
     
     The PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture. The HANDLER motions to him
     to stop, and then goes and sits near the door. The REPORTER
     still stands near the doorway, seeming quite stunned by the
     scene he is witnessing, but nevertheless continuing to
     scribble away on his pad.
     
     JOEY, standing near JAKE, has his back to everyone; his
     shoulders are shaking, his lips are tightly drawn. He cries
     soundlessly. TONY is pacing nearby.
     
                     TONY
           Don't fight anymore!
                (pause)
           It's a free country, don't fight
           anymore!
     
                     JAKE
                (between sobs)
           Why did they have to stop it? Why
           did they have to stop it?
     
     The REPORTER leans over to the HANDLER and whispers.
     
                     REPORTER
           What happened?
     
                     HANDLER
                (quietly)
           He must've been really hurt in the
           2nd. He didn't answer me when I
           tried to tell him something in the
           corner.
     
     JAKE, still buried in his robe, becomes aware of the hum of
     voices and shouts out:
     
                     JAKE
           Get everyone out of here!
     
     The REPORTER and the PHOTOGRAPHER leave. JAKE continues to
     sob.
     
     INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
     
     INSERT: CLOSE UP of a Daily News Headline from November 22,
     1947: "Board Suspends LaMotta."
     
     JAKE, dejected, sits on the couch. In front of him, on the
     coffee table are scattered several newspapers -- including
     the one with the headline we have just seen.
     
     JOEY paces in front of JAKE.
     
                     JOEY
                (yelling)
           It woulda been so easy, Jack. So
           easy...
     
     JOEY goes into a boxing stance.
     
                     JOEY (CONT'D)
           Stick out your hands, Jake.
     
                     JAKE
           C'mon, Joey.
     
                     JOEY
           G'wan, do it.
                (jabs at him)
           Protect yourself, rummy.
     
     JAKE, out of reflex, sticks out his hands. As he does, JOEY
     feigns a hit and falls onto the floor -- "out cold." JAKE
     looks down at him.
     
     JOEY pops to his feet.
     
                     JOEY (CONT'D)
           See? That's all there was to it.
     
                     JAKE
           What the fuck they want? I took the
           dive. They want me to fall down
           too? I don't fall down for nobody.
           I never went down in my life. Joey,
           what do I gotta do?
           Crawl on my hands and knees? I made
           an asshole of myself in the fuckin'
           Garden! All the newspaper writers
           make fun of me. I'm the bum of the
           year. All I want is a shot. Just a
           fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do?
           I'll do anything.
     
                     JOEY
           Except fall down like a normal
           person.
     
                     JAKE
           Yeah, except fall down. That's
           right.
     
                     JOEY
           All right, you don't wanna fall
           down, so now you gotta take a rest.
           So, you enjoy the suspension.
           'Cause there's nothin' you can do
           about it. Let the Commissioner and
           the D.A. jerk you around. So you
           wait.
     
                     JAKE
           Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am
           I gonna do for seven months? I'm
           gonna go crazy. How do I keep my
           strength? By that time I'll be too
           weak to win the title. And my
           weight? Forget about it -- I'm
           gonna blow up like a balloon. I
           ain't never gonna hold my weight
           down. Seven months! I don't know...
     
                     JOEY
           We did what we had to do. Tommy
           don't forget. Sooner or later
           you'll get your shot -- if Tommy
           don't die.
     
     EXT. BOOK-CADILLAC HOTEL, DETROIT - DAY (1949)
     
     It's raining outside the stately Book-Cadillac.
     
     A banner above the door proclaims.
                   The Book-Cadillac Welcomes
                         Marcel Cerdan
               Middleweight Champion of the World
                       and the Challenger
                          Jake LaMotta
     
     INT. BOOK-CADILLAC LOBBY - DAY
     
     The lobby is chaotic: FIGHT PEOPLE and SPORTSWRITERS mill
     anxiously about. Something's in the air.
     
     The BELL CAPTAIN pages:
     
                     BELL CAPTAIN
           Mr. Williams.
     
     MR. WILLIAMS, THE DETROIT PROMOTER last seen in the
     Copacabana Lounge, answers the page.
     
     WILLIAMS listens on the phone a moment, then hands it back to
     the BELL CAPTAIN and announces:
     
                     DETROIT PROMOTER
           It's official. The fight's been
           postponed twenty-four hours.
     
     A groan goes up from the lobby.
     
     INT. LAMOTTA'S SUITE - DAY
     
     JAKE's suite is modestly decorated and consists of a living
     room and two bedrooms.
     
     DR. PINTO is there sewing up a pork chop.
     
     JAKE, shadow-boxing in sportswear, paces back and forth.
     
     TONY watches him. VICKIE sits quietly on the sofa, sipping
     some wine.
     
     JOEY is on the phone.
     
                     JOEY
           That's right. "No comment."
                (listens)
           You like that? Good, 'cause I got a
           lot more "No comments" where that
           one came from.
     
     JOEY cuts the line off, then leaves the receiver off the
     hook.
     
                     JOEY (CONT'D)
           I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have
           a steak.
     
                     JAKE
           I can't eat a steak. If I eat a
           steak, I'm gonna have trouble
           making the weigh-in.
     
                     JOEY
           So eat just a little. You gotta eat
           something.
     
                     JARS
           What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I
           can't even eat!
     
     JAKE goes into the bedroom.
     
     JOEY goes over to the DOCTOR.
     
                     DOCTOR
                (shows him the pork chop)
           How's that?
     
                     JOEY
           How long did it take you?
     
                     DOCTOR
           45 seconds.
     
                     JOEY
           No good. Try to get it down. It's
           gotta be no more than 30 seconds to
           be on the safe side if we gotta
           stitch him up.
     
     INT. THE BEDROOM
     
     JAKE is alone. There is a knock at the door. JOEY opens it
     and pokes his head in.
     
                     JOEY
           Jake, somebody wants to say hello
           to you.
     
     JOEY opens the door wider. TOMMY COMO is at the door with
     JOEY. JAKE goes over to the door.
     
                     COMO
           Hey champ!
     
                     JAKE
           Tommy, thanks for coming over.
     
                     COMO
           You just take it easy, now. You'll
           do all right. Feelin' Ok?
     
                     JAKE
           I'm Ok.
     
                     COMO
           Just come by to wish you luck.
                (shakes his hand)
           Need anything?
     
                     JAKE
           No, we're all right. Thanks anyway,
           Tommy.
     
                     COMO
           Ok, champ.
     
     COMO turns to go. He says goodbye to everyone in the living
     room. He goes over and kisses VICKIE. JAKE watches this from
     the bedroom doorway.
     
                     COMO (CONT'D)
                (as he kisses Vickie)
           Look at her. As beautiful as
           always. Take care of that guy, will
           ya?
     
                     VICKIE
                (going to the door with
                him)
           I'll take care of him. Thanks,
           Tommy. Bye.
     
                     JAKE
                (to Vickie)
           C'mere.
     
     She goes to the bedroom doorway. JAKE grabs her arm, pulls
     her in, and slams the door.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
                (pushing her toward the
                bed area)
           Hey, you don't say goodbye to him
           like that.
     
                     VICKIE
           What did I do?
     
                     JAKE
                (pushing her)
           You don't kiss like that. Hello and
           goodbye, that's all you do.
     
                     VICKIE
           All I did...
     
                     JAKE
                (interrupting)
           You know what I'm talking about.
           Don't ever make me look bad on the
           night of my big fight.
     
                     VICKIE
           You're hurting my arm.
     
     JAKE has her by the night table now. They are edging their
     way to the wall.
     
                     JAKE
           Shut up. You just say hello and
           goodbye to him. You don't kiss him
           the way you did. That's out of
           line.
     
     JAKE pushes her against the wall. The lamp falls. There is a
     loud crash. She tries to move away. He grabs her by the
     throat and pins her against the wall. She's gagging.
     
                     VICKIE
           But Jake... I didn't say
           anything...
     
                     JAKE
           Don't ever do that again. You don't
                (he pushes her against the
                wall)
           do it!
     
                     VICKIE
                (gagging)
           Jake...
     
     JOEY looks in and then starts to come over.
     
                     JAKE
           You hear what I said? You don't do
           it.
     
     He pushes her again. VICKIE tries to get away, but can't
     move.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
                (pushing her again)
           You don't do it.
     
     JOEY has his hand on JAKE's arm, trying to pry it away from
     VICKIE's throat.
     
                     JOEY
           Jake, Jake...
     
     TONY and the DOCTOR watch from the doorway.
     
     VICKIE's eyes close. JAKE releases his grip. JOEY helps
     VICKIE. JAKE watches this.
     
                     JAKE
                (to himself)
           She ain't gonna ruin this fight for
           me.
     
     EXT. BRIGGS STADIUM - NIGHT (JUNE 16, 1949)
     
     Bright floodlights illuminate the arena. The weather's clear
     and the stadium is filled with cheering fight FANS.
     
     An ANNOUNCER steps into the center of the ring and begins ti
     introduce the many CELEBRITIES that have gathered for the
     fight.
     
                     ANNOUNCER
           And here is the young man who has
           inherited Marcel Cerdan's European
           championship - Laurent Dauthuille.
     
     DAUTHUILLE jumps into the ring.
     
     While WE HEAR him introduce the boxers and celebrities, WE
     SEE a rapid MONTAGE: JAKE preparing for the title bout:
     
     PRE-FIGHT MONTAGE
     
     A) JAKE and GROUP arrive in the dressing room.
     
     B) In his bathrobe, JAKE puts on his boxing shoes.
     
     C) We see a pan with raw steak in it. JOEY drains the blood
     (juice) into a glass and JAKE takes a long, slow swallow.
     
     D) REPRISE of IMAGES from PREVIOUS SCENE (SLOW MOTION) - NEW
     ANGLE.
     
     TOMMY COMO shakes JAKE's hand in the bathroom doorway. VICKIE
     kisses COMO. Jake watches.
     
                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
           And our very special guest tonight
           needs no introduction. The only man
           to defend the heavyweight crown a
           remarkable twenty-five times, the
           king of all heavyweights, the Brown
           Bomber, Joe Louis. Come into the
           ring, Joe.
     
                     JOE LOUIS (V.O.)
           Thank you, Johnny. Let's bring the
           middleweight crown back to the old
           U.S.A. where it belongs.
     
     Many cheers.
     
     E) DR. PINTO injects a hypodermic needle filled with
     novocaine into each of JAKE's fists.
     
     F) JOEY massages JAKE's neck.
     
     G) JAKE's hands are bandaged
     
     H) REPRISE of IMAGES from PREVIOUS SCENE (SLOW MOTION - NEW
     ANGLE)
     
     JAKE strangles VICKIE in the bedroom, then releases her.
     
     JOEY looks after her, but the IMAGE makes them look as if
     they're making love. Jake watches.
     
                     ANNOUNCER
           And in this corner, the
           middleweight champion of the world,
           from Casablanca, Morocco, the
           Casablanca Clouter, Marcel Cerdan!
     
     I) JAKE puts on his cup and trunks.
     
     J) MARIO laces up JAKE's gloves.
     
     K) JAKE, ready to fight, a towel draped around his head,
     bounces on the balls of his feet. He starts walking down the
     corridor from his dressing room, surrounded by MARIO, JOEY,
     DR. PINTO and his HANDLERS. He enters the stadium.
     
     INT. BRIGGS STADIUM - NIGHT
     
     JAKE, wearing his leopard-skin robe, is pushed through the
     CROWD by JOEY, MARIO and his HANDLERS. He's still shadow
     boxing.
     
     JAKE steps into the ring to both cheers and boos (many still
     remember the Fox fight). JAKE raises his gloves.
     
                     ANNOUNCER
           And in the opposite corner, from
           New York, New York, the challenger,
           the Bronx Bull, Jake LaMotta!
     
     JAKE shakes hands with the assembled CELEBRITIES and EX
     CHAMPIONS.
     
                     JAYE
           I only wish it was you, Joe.
     
                     JOE LOUIS
           Win the belt back for us, Jake.
           Good luck.
     
     JAKE glances at VICKIE who is sitting in the third row. She
     is nervous.
     
                                         TIME CUT:
     
     The opening bell sounds. CERDAN and LAMOTTA touch gloves and
     begin to fight.
     
     JAKE is hot: there's no stopping him tonight. He fights like
     a man possessed.
     
     CERDAN clinches JAKE to avoid his brutal body blows. JAKE
     pushes him out of the clinch in disgust.
     
     There are no more boos. JAKE has won over the crowd.
     
                                         TIME CUT:
     
     END OF ROUND NINE. JAKE is working over a bloody CERDAN.
     Punches to the body, then to the head, then back to the body.
     The bell sounds.
     
     JAKE walks back to his corner and sits down. JOEY is
     ecstatic:
     
                     JOEY
           Look at him, Jackie! You got at!
           The fuckin' championship! He's
           yours! Finish him off.
     
     JAKE doesn't have the chance. The REFEREE, standing in
     CERDAN's corner, waves his hands signaling the end of the
     fight.
     
     The REFEREE holds up JAKE's hands as THE ANNOUNCER takes the
     mike:
     
                     ANNOUNCER
           The new middleweight champion of
           the world by a knockout after nine
           rounds, the Bronx Bull, Jake
           LaMotta!
     
     JOEY is all over him. TONY helps VICKIE through the MOB.
     
     In his corner, CERDAN holds his head in his hands and says,
     "My title, my title!"
     
     The OFFICIALS clear a circle as they bring over the jewel
     studded championship belt. JOE LOUIS fastens the belt around
     JAKE's waist.
     
     JAKE touches the oversized belt with his bloody gloves. Tears
     fall across JAKE's huge grin as he holds his hands high in
     the air. It is the most glorious night in his life.
     
     EXT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - NIGHT (1956)
     
     The name "Jake LaMotta's Lounge" is emblazoned in neon across
     a lounge/liquor store on Collins Avenue, Miami's main drag.
     JAKE's bar is across from The Rooney Plaza, one of Miami's
     more prestigious hotels.
     
     Fifties cars are parked outside the club.
     
     INT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - NIGHT
     
     JAKE LAMOTTA, 34 years old, wearing a tux, steps in front of
     a large painted wall mural of the Cerdan fight as he enters
     his club.
     
     The Lounge is dominated by a large circular bar. Featured
     entertainers perform on a raised platform in the center of
     the bar.
     
     The club is half filled with SPORTS, ENTERTAINMENT and MOB
     TYPES.
     
     The small BAND plays a routine fanfare as JAKE steps onto the
     platform. He takes the mike with one hand and silences the
     BAND with the other. The applause dies out as he speaks:
     
                     JAKE
           Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
           It's a thrill to be standin' here
           talking to you wonderful people. In
           fact, it's a thrill to be standin'.
           I haven't seen so many people since
           my last fight at Madison Square
           Garden. After that fight a reporter
           asked me, "Jake, where do you go
           from here?" I said, "To a
           hospital."
     
     About HALF THE PATRONS are listening; of them, HALF are
     laughing, SOME a little too loud.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           I fought one hundred and six
           professional fights and none of
           them bums figured out how to fight
           me -- they kept hitting me in the
           head!
                (calls to the bar)
           Will somebody at the bar -- Linda? 
           - get me a drink. I figure if I'm
           gonna work to drunks I might as
           well be one of 'em! I like this
           place. It's a family type club...
           every night I see a lot of fathers
           sitting out there with their young
           daughters! That's nice.
     
     LINDA hands him a drink.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           Thanks, honey. -- She's terrific.
           The kinda girl you wanta take home
           to meet your father. Especially if
           your old man's a degenerate! --
           Here's a toast! "To your health!
           You only live once. But if you play
           it right, once is enough." I
           shouldn't be drinkin' like this
           'cause I'm tryin' to lose weight.
           I'm on this terrific diet -- I'm
           allowed to eat anything I want. As
           long as I don't swallow it! Well, I
           never had much luck with my weight.
           In fact, -- I never had much luck
           with anything -- until about a few
           years ago, when this happened --
     
     He indicates the blow-up behind him and waits for applause,
     of which there is some.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           ... thanks, I'm glad to see you
           remember. For those of you that
           don't... that's me takin' the title
           from Cerdan.
           You know, the tough thing about
           winnin' the title... the next thing
           you gotta do is have a rematch...
           just to show it wasn't no fluke. So
           what happens? Marcel Cerdan, a
           really great champ, after I beat
           him... he gets himself killed in
           that airplane crash... a pretty
           rotten break for him. That's why I
           don't like to fly. People say to
           me, "Look, Jake, when your time is
           up, your time is up." And I say,
           "Yeah, but suppose I'm on the plane
           and the pilot's time is up?" As
           good as Cerdan was, I could've
           taken him again. But I never got
           the chance to prove it wasn't no
           fluke. He got killed but he got to
           be what they call a legend. I don't
           know what's worse -- bein' a fluke
           or bein' a legend. -- That's the
           kinda luck I got. That's why I quit
           the ring and moved down here from
           New York. My wife said, "You gotta
           get outa this town, Jake." Come to
           think of it... the boxing
           commission said the same thing! But
           I don't miss New York. Give me
           Miami any day.
     
     The AUDIENCE applauds.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           Miami's a great place. I get along
           with everybody in this town... even
           the police force... They got the
           best cops here money can buy! --
           Only kiddin'. By the way... me and
           my wife Vickie's gettin' ready to
           celibrate our eleventh wedding
           anniversary.
     
     More applause.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           We get along real great. We fight a
           little but I never really belted
           her on purpose. Once  in a while
           I'm standin' there doin' little
           shadow-boxin' and she happens to
           walk right into the shadow... I
           can't help that.
           She says, "Whataya hittin' me for?"
           I says, "It's nothin'. It's only a
           love tap." She says, "It's a good
           thing you're not crazy about me!" --
           I am crazy about her. I heard her
           talkin' to a friend on the phone
           and she was sayin', "After eleven
           years, I'm still in love with the
           same guy." -- If I ever find out
           who the bum is, I'll kill him!
           Women. You can't live with 'em, you
           can't live without 'em.
     
     Then, suddenly, falling into character... he quotes lago's
     speech in Othello.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           "'Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy.
           It is the green-eyed monster, which
           doth mock the meat it feeds on.
           That cuckold lives in bliss who,
           certain of his fate, loves not his
           woronger; But O, what damned
           minutes tells he o'er who dotes,
           yet doubts -- suspects, yet fondly
           loves!" -- That's from somethin'
           called "Othello" --
     
     OR, ALTERNATE SPEECH:
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           Is whispering nothing? Is leaning
           cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?
           Kissing with inside lip? Stopping
           the career of laughter with a sign?
           -- A note infallible of breaking
           honesty -- horsing foot on foot?
           Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks
           more swift? Hours, minutes? Noon,
           midnight? and all eyes blind with
           the pin and web but theirs, theirs
           only, that would unseen be wicked?
           Is this nothing? Why, then the
           world and all that's in't is
           nothing; The covering sky is
           nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife
           is nothing; nor nothing have these
           nothings, if this be nothing." --
           That's from something called "The
           Winter's Tale" -- Shakespeare! You
           all remember Shakespeare.
           He wrote all them famous plays one
           after the other, then he went into
           a big slump and he ain't done
           anything good in years. That speech
           is about jealousy -- jealousy's a
           bad thing. Jealousy bothers a lot
           of guys... take me... I almost
           killed my brother... I love him...
           he's my family... I mean, there's
           nothin' he wouldn't do for me. And
           that's the way we been goin' thru
           life -- doin' nothin' for each
           other! Anytime he got in trouble
           when we was kids, I got him out of
           it. You know, he used to steal
           little things when we was growin'
           up. But he was particular... only
           stole things that begin with an 'a'
           -- a watch, a car, a suit, a
           ring... But I was wrong... I
           shoulda never hit my brother.
           Afterwards, I was sorry. Now every
           time I need somethin' I gotta go
           shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist
           once told me, "When you hit your
           brother you're really hittin' your
           mother, but you can't admit it to
           yourself." He's really crazy. I
           woulda never hit my mother. I mean,
           only in self-defense!
     
     INT. JAKE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY (1950)
     
     JAKE is struggling with his later model ten-inch RCA TV. He
     fools with the dials, then slaps the side. The bluish video
     image comes and goes. JOEY watches JAKE fix the TV.
     
     JAKE has a half-eaten sandwich in his hand.
     
     VICKIE enters the house, surprised to find JAKE home.
     
                     VICKIE
           Jake, you're home.
     
     JAKE looks up at her. (She goes over to him and kisses him.)
     MOVING SHOT.
     
     JOEY gives VICKIE a polite peck on the mouth. MOVING SHOT.
     
                     JOEY
           Hi, Vickie.
     
     JAKE watches JOEY kiss VICKIE. VICKIE notices JAKE'S
     reaction.
     
                     VICKIE
           What's the matter with you?
     
                     JAKE
           Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to
           work. Paid all this money for it
           and still can't get a station a
           mile away. And Mr. Wizard here
           ain't no help.
     
                     JOEY
           Screw you, Jack.
     
                     JAKE
                (to Vickie)
           Where you been?
     
     VICKIE goes into the bedroom to take off her coat. On the
     stairs, MOVING SHOT:
     
                     VICKIE
           I went out.
     
                     JAKE
                (to Joey)
           What's that kissing on the mouth
           shit?
     
                     JOEY
           What? I just said hello. Since when
           I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
     
                     JAKE
           Ain't a cheek ever good enough for
           you? I never even kissed Mama on
           the mouth.
     
                     JOEY
           Well, you're not supposed to kiss
           your mother on the mouth.
     
                     JAKE
           Well, that's what I mean.
     
     JAKE leans over the TV.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           How's that?
     
                     JOEY
           I can't tell. You're stomach's in
           the way.
     
     JAKE stares at JOEY.
     
                     JOEY (CONT'D)
           Don't give me those looks. I'm just
           your manager. The minute you start
           to be champ, you start eating like
           there's no tomorrow. And you giving
           me looks. All I know is that I
           don't have to defend my title next
           month.
     
     JAKE looks up at JOEY.
     
                     JAKE
           Answer me somethin'. What happened
           at the Copa with Salvy when I was
           out of town?
     
                     JOEY
           When?
     
                     JAKE
           You know, when you gave him a
           beatin'.
     
                     JOEY
                (being as vague as
                possible)
           Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He
           was drunk or somethin', I dunno.
           Anyway, the windup was I gave him a
           beatin'. Tommy called me down, and
           we straightened it out. It's all
           forgotten about.
     
                     JAKE
           Why didn't you tell me about it?
     
                     JOEY
           It didn't have nothin' to do with
           you.
     
                     JAKE
           Didn't it have nothin' to do with
           me?
     
                     JOEY
           No, I just told you what happened.
     
                     JAKE
                (he obviously knows)
           Who did it have anything to do
           with... Vickie?
     
                     JOEY
           Jack, no. I just explained the
           whole thing to you. It was just
           between me and Salvy, if it had
           anything to do with you and Vickie,
           I woulda told you about it.
     
                     JAKE
           Well, I heard some things.
     
     MOVING in on JOEY, JAKE'S P.O.V.
     
                     JOEY
           "You heard some things." Will you
           stop worryin' about that shit?
           Forget about it. You know you got a
           title fight comin' up.
     
     PAUSE.
     
                     JOEY
                (refering to the TV)
           Whatever you touched, that's good
           now.
     
                     JAKE
           Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
     
                     JOEY
           What?
     
                     JAKE
           You're supposed to keep an eye on
           her for me. I'm askin'...
     
                     JOEY
                (interrupting)
           I did keep an eye...
     
                     JAKE
           Then why did you give him a beatin'
           if he didn't do anything? You and
           him been friends a long time.
     
                     JOEY
           Some things changed between us.
           Now, he thinks who the fuck he is.
           He's been passing certain remarks
           that I don't like.
     
                     JAKE
                (interrupting)
           Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't
           tellin' me the truth.
     
                     JOEY
           What bullshit? Hey, I'm your
           brother. You wanna believe me - you
           trust me?
     
                     JAKE
           When it comes to her, I don't trust
           nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
     
                     JOEY
           Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm
           tellin" you what happened. He got
           outta line, we had a fight, and
           it's staightened out now.
     
     There is a pause. (Move in on JOEY, JAKE'S P.O.V.)
     
                     JAKE
                (suspicious)
           You givin' me that look. I gotta
           accept your word, but if I find out
           anythin', I'm gonna kill
           somebody...
     
                     JOEY
                (yelling)
           So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill
           Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy
           Como, kill me while you're at it.
           What do I care? You're killing
           yourself the way you're eating, the
           way you worry about things you
           don't have to worry about.
     
                     JAKE
                (interrupting)
           What do you mean, "you"?
     
                     JOEY
           What?
     
                     JAKE
                (interrupting, catching
                Joey)
           What do you mean, "you"?
     
                     JOEY
                (caught)
           I meant, kill everybody. You or me
           or anybody. You're a big shot.
           Kill, kill... g'head.
     
                     JAKE
           But you said "you."
     
                     JOEY
           So what?
     
                     JAKE
           Eh, Joey, even you don't know what
           you meant. You mentioned Salvy,
           Tommy Como, you -- that means
           somethin'. Why'd you say them? You
           coulda said anybody.
     
                     JOEY
           You're worried about this girl,
           you're gonna let this girl ruin
           you're life for you... You wanna
           worry, worry about your fuckin'
           stomach that you can't bend over --
           that you gotta step in the ring in
           a month.
     
                     JAKE
           Did you ever fuck my wife?
     
                     JOEY
           What?
     
                     JAKE
           I don't mean now. I mean before --
           before we met.
     
                     JOEY
           Whadda ya mean?
     
                     JAKE
           Did you ever fuck my wife?
     
                     JOEY
           Whatsa matter with you?
     
                     JAKE
           You're very smart, Joey, very
           smart. Nobody gives me a straight
           answer around here.
           You're givin' me these answers, but
           you still didn't answer my
           question. Did you fuck Vickie?
     
                     JOEY
                (fed up, he starts to
                leave)
           I gotta go. I gotta get outta here.
           I can't take this shit. Lenore is
           waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're
           a definite wacko. You're fuckin'
           crazy, you know that, crazy.
     
     JAKE'S P.O.V., MOVING SHOT as JOEY leaves. JAKE goes into the
     bedroom.
     
     INT. THE BEDROOM
     
     JAKE walks over to VICKIE. (MOVE in on VICKIE - JAKE'S P.O.V.
     becomes her shot.)
     
                     JAKE
           Where you been all day?
     
                     VICKIE
           I took the kids to my sister's.
     
                     JAKE
           I called. You weren't there.
     
                     VICKIE
           I got bored so I went to the
           movies.
     
                     JAKE
           What'd you see?
     
                     VICKIE
           I went to the movies.
     
                     JAKE
           What'd you see?
     
                     VICKIE
           "Father of the Bride."
     
                     JAKE
           What was it about?
     
                     VICKIE
           Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I
           have to tell you everything?
     
                     JAKE
           Did you ever go to the Copa when I
           was away?
     
                     VICKIE
           What're you talking about?
     
                     JAKE
           Answer me when I talk to you. What
           happened that night?
     
                     VICKIE
                (interrupting, yelling)
           I am answering...
     
                     JAKE
                (hits her)
           What do I have to do to get a
           straight answer around here.
     
     JAKE holds onto her, but she gets away.
     
                     VICKIE
           Jake, no --
     
                     JAKE
                (as he chases her around
                the room)
           Do I have to kill you, eh?
                (hits her)
           Do I have to kill somebody to get
           an answer?
                (hits her)
           I know about you at the Copa. I
           know all about it.
     
     JAKE catches her.
     
                     VICKIE
           I didn't do anything wrong. I
           swear. I just had a few drinks.
     
                     JAKE
                (pins her down, hits her)
           With Salvy, eh?
     
                     VICKIE
           I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy
           was there.
                (gets hit)
           Stop it. I just had a drink, that's
           all. I didn't do anything wrong.
                (gets hit)
     
     VICKIE escapes and locks herself in the bathroom.
     
                     JAKE
                (by bathroom door)
           Come out of there! Did you fuck
           Salvy?
                (punches door)
           Answer me. Open this fuckin' door,
           you fuckin' cunt!
                (punches door)
           Who've you been fuckin'?
     
                     VICKIE
                (from inside bathroom)
           Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
     
                     JAKE
           You're a fuckin' liar.
     
     He breaks down the door.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           Who've you been fuckin'? Salvy?
                (hits her)
           Tommy Como?
                (hits her)
           I can't trust nobody.
                (hits her)
           Did you fuck Joey?
                (hits her)
           Who you been fuckin'?
     
     She finally manages to push him away.
     
                     VICKIE
           All right, I fucked everybody! Go
           ahead, kill me, kill me.
     
     VICKIE takes JAKE's hand and hits herself. JAKE is stunned.
     
                     VICKIE (CONT'D)
           I'll say anything you want me to
           say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked
           Tommy. I fucked your brother. I
           fucked everybody! What do you want
           to hear? I sucked your brother's
           fuckin' cock!
     
                     JAKE
           You did?
     
                     VICKIE
           Yeah, I sucked his cock.
     
     JAKE starts to walk away. VICKIE goes after him.
     
     JAKE is gone.
     
     INT. JOEY'S PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - DAY
     
     JOEY is at the kitchen table eating lunch with his family.
     His wife, LENORE, her hair done up in pin curls, sits next to
     him. JOEY's TWO KIDS sit across the table from them,
     bickering.
     
                     JOEY
                (to kids)
           Don't hit your brother! Be nice.
     
     Suddenly, JAKE comes through the front door, goes directly to
     the table, grabs JOEY, lifts him into the air, and starts
     hitting him.
     
                     JOEY (CONT'D)
           Jake, stop it.
     
     JAKE keeps hitting JOEY. The KIDS start to cry. LENORE wants
     to stop the fight, but is afraid to get too close.
     
                     JAKE
           Was Vickie part of the deal with
           Tommy? Was my wife part of the
           deal? Tell me, was that it?
     
                     JOEY
           Stop it. What're you, crazy?
     
     JAKE drags JOEY into the living room, and pushes him onto the
     floor.
     
                     JAKE
                (kneeling over Joey and
                hitting him)
           You didn't tell me. You didn't tell
           me. You let me marry her. You let
           me marry her.
     
     VICKIE rushes into the house, past LENORE and the TWO KIDS
     who are screaming even louder now.
     
                     VICKIE
                (hitting Jake on his back
                as he hits Joey)
           You're killing him. You're killing
           him for nothing. Stop it.
     
                     JAKE
                (hits her)
           Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you
           mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
     
                     VICKIE
                (still hitting Jake)
           Nothing is what I said! Go on, kull
           me.
                (hits him)
           Kill me.
                (hits him)
           I'm not afraid of you anymore. I
           don't care if you kill me like
           you're killing him. You're a sick
           animal.
     
     JOEY is knocked out. LENORE goes over to him and holds him.
     
                     JAKE
                (to Vickie)
           You're the fuckin' animal! You ran
           around with every guy I knew while
           I was breakin' my ass for you.
     
                     VICKIE
                (as she pushes and hits
                Jake to the front door)
           You're not only an animal, you're a
           stupid animal.
                (pushes and hits him out
                the front door)
           You're rotten.
                (hits him)
           Rotten.
                (hits him)
           Rotten.
                (hits him)
           You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You
           belong in a mental hospital.

     VICKIE gives JAKE a final push out the door and then slams it
     in his face.
     
     JAKE is left alone on the front steps.

     EVENING
     
     JAKE sits alone in the darkness.
     
     VICKIE lets herself in. She comes and stands behind him.
     
                     VICKIE
           Well, he ain't dead in case you're
           interested.
                (pause)
           I'm leaving you. And I don't care
           if you do try to kill me. Go ahead.
           I'm not afraid of you anymore.
           There's worse things than being
           dead and one of them's living with
           you --
                (pause)
           I'm leaving tonight. I must have
           been crazier than you are for
           stayin' with you this long. You're
           hopeless. You're not gonna let
           anybody love you. I kept thinking
           that you'd change when you got to
           be the champ... But I just can't
           take it anymore. I'm taking the
           kids and I'm leavin'.
     
     There is a pause.
     
                     JAKE
           Aw, Vickie, aw Vickie, please no.
           Vickie, no... don't leave me.
           Christ, I'm pleading... I know, I
           know all the bad things, but I need
           you. I'm a bum without you and the
           kids. I'll change. Aw, Vickie,
           maybe I don't do it the right way,
           but I love you. I love you.
     
     There is a pause.
     
                     VICKIE
           You know, if there's one thing -- I
           just don't understand you, not one
           single little bit. You love me?

           Yeah --

     The steam is oppressively thick. It must be 140 degrees.
     
     JAKE, nude, does push-ups on the floor. His body is bathed in
     sweat.
     
     He pushes himself up, then collapses. His eyes are glazed
     over from lack of strength.
     
     He makes his way to the door and pounds on it.
     
     TONY opens the door and gets on his knees beside JAKE.
     
                     TONY
           It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
     
                     JAKE
                (barely coherent)
           What time is it?
     
                     TONY
           Nine o'clock.
     
                     JAKE
           At night?

           Yeah. At night.
     
                     JAKE
           How many pounds I gotta lose?
     
                     TONY
           Three more, I figure.
     
                     JAKE
           Just give me a chip of ice to put
           in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
     
                     TONY
           I'll give you anything you want,
           Jake. I think you should come out
           for a few minutes -- give yourself
           a break.
     
                     JAKE
                (barely audible)
           Are you outa your mind? If I come
           out, I'll lose the title.

     VICKIE is seated on the sofa, reading newspapers. JAKE is
     pacing.
     
                     VICKIE
           Jake, why don't you just try lying
           down and get some rest.
     
                     JAKE
           I don't know what it is. I dunno,
           it's the kind of thing that -- the
           words won't come out.
     
                     VICKIE
           Jake --
     
                     JAKE
           What?
     
                     VICKIE
           I want to say something to you
           without you blowing your stack.
     
                     JAKE
           OK. Talk.
     
                     VICKIE
                (pause)
           Why don't you just call him up?
     
                     JAKE
           What do I say to him? Call him up
           on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm
           sorry about that little trouble we
           had. How about havin' dinner?" Is
           that what I say?
     
                     VICKIE
           No, not that.
     
                     JAKE
           Then what?
     
                     VICKIE
                (pause)
           I don't know.
     
     INT. OLYMPIA STADIUM, DETROIT - NIGHT (SEPT. 13, 1950)
     
     The LAMOTTA-DAUTHUILLE middleweight championship is told
     through the eyes and words of the RINGSIDE ANNOUNCER. JAKE is
     not doing well.
     
                     RINGSIDE ANNOUNCER
           ... Ladies and gentlemen, I've sat
           in front of these microphones for
           over twenty years but this is the
           strangest championship bout I've
           ever seen. With two minutes to go
           in the final round, the champion,
           the mighty Bull from the Bronx, is
           just simply taking punch after
           punch from the challenger.
           Dauthuille scores a combination,
           then backpedals. LaMotta pursues
           him. One minute to go. Laurent
           DauthuiLlle, who has already beat
           Lamotta in a non-title bout, is
           about to fulfill a dream -- to
           bring the middleweight crown back
           to France.
     
     In the ring, JAKE looks like he's on queer street. Bouncing
     off the ropes, opening his jaw to DAUTHUILLE. But
     DAUTHUILLE's punches lack strength. JAKM is playing possum.
     
                     RINGSIDE'ANNOUNCER
           Thirty seconds to go. The Bull
           starts to swing. LaMotta comes in
           for a brutal body combinaticn: one,
           two, three, four punches. LaMotta
           has landed a solid left hook to the
           Frenchman's jaw! Dauthuille seems
           confused. LaMotta is swinging
           wildly now: right, left, right,
           left! Dauthuille is backing off!
           Everyone is on their feet! I can
           hardly see, ladies and gentlemen.
           Dauthuille is on the ropes. LaMotta
           hits a right -- Dauthuille is down!
           Dauthuille is down! Referee Lou
           Handler is counting him out --
           three, four, five -- if Dauthuille
           can stand, he'll win the decision --
           eight, nine --  Dauthuille is on
           one knee -- ten! It's all over!
           With thirteen seconds left on the
           clock, Jake LaMotta has retained
           his middleweight championship in
           one of the most remarkable combacks
           in boxing! Dauthuille is standing
           now, confused. But the fight is
           over.
     
     AN ANNOUNCER holds up JAKE's victorious hand. He seems as
     surprised as everyone else.
     
     TONY throws JAKE'S robe around his shoulders as THE ANNOUNCER
     calls out:
     
                     ANNOUNCER
           The middleweight champion, and
           still champion by a knockout in
           fifteen rounds, the Bronx Bull, the
           Raging Bull, Jake LaMotta!
     
     The CROWD cheers. JAKE raises his arms in victory.
     
     INT. JAKE'S DRESSING ROOM - OLYMPIA STADIUM - NIGHT
     
     It is after the fight. TONY, VICKIE, and OTHERS are in the
     room. Some PEOPLE are leaving. Congratulations are heard.
     
     TONY puts away JAKE's fight gear.
     
     JAKE, half-dressed, looks troubled.
     
                     JAKE
                (to Vickie)
           I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
     
                     VICKIE
           Why don't you just call him?
     
                     JAKE
           I dunno.
     
                     VICKIE
           Tell him how you feel -- you miss
           him. Tell him you're sorry.
     
                     JAKE
                (pauze)
           Ok, all right. Telephone's in the
           hall. Dial his number.
     
     VICKIE goes to the pay phone in the hall, and dials long
     distance.
     
     JAKE is nervous, but follows VICKIE.
     
                     THE HALLWAY
           As the number starts to ring,
           VICKIE hands the phone to JAKE.
     
                     JOEY (O.S.)
           Hello... hello...
     
     JAKE can't answer.
     
                     JOEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           What's this, a joke? Hello... Hey!
     
     JAKE can't answer.
     
                     JOEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           Well, if there's somebody
           listenin', their mother's a fuckin'
           whore who takes it in the ass.
     
     There is a click as JOEY hangs up.
     
     JAKE stands there, and finally hangs up the phone.
     
     INT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - NIGHT (1956)
     
     JAKE gulps down the last of his Scotch.
     
                     JAKE
                (continuing his monologue)
           I shoulda never hit my brother.
           Afterwards I was sorry. Now every
           time I need somethin' I gotta go
           shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist
           once told me, "When you hit your
           brother you're really hittin' your
           mother but you can't admit it to
           yourself." He's really crazy. I
           woulda never hit my mother. I mean,
           only in self-defense! A lot of
           people wanta know who was the best
           guy I ever fought. Let's see...
           there was that one I fought
           twice... the other Frenchman... you
           know who I mean...
                (having trouble
                pronouncing the name)
           ... Dauthuille! He was tough, but I
           beat him... I had to! I mean, how
           would it sound losin' to a guy
           whose name you can't even
           pronounce? But... Robinson. I can
           say that alright. I fought Sugar
           Ray so many times it's a wonder I
           don't have diabetes! Linda... get
           me another drink! Linda's the most
           popular waitress here... you can
           tell by her tips! She's the kinda
           girl I go for. You oughta see the
           ones I get.
     
     LINDA brings him another Scotch.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           ... Thanks, babe. She's a nice kid.
           She'll only do it with a guy if she
           really likes him. She's got a lot
           in common with Will Rogers -- never
           met a man she didn't like! ... I
           was talkin' about Sugar Ray. Some
           of you think I was better than
           him... but you know, it's a toss
           up. Except the last fight...
           February 14, 1951.
     
     JAKE sips his drink.

           Valentine's Day. The anniversary of
           the St. Valentine's Massacre.
           Robinson didn't use a machine gun
           but it was still a massacre...
     
     JAKE takes another drink.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           Actually, I was doin' okay at
           first. In fact, by the end of the
           fifth round I really had him
           worried -- he thought he killed me.

     on JOEY's new television console.
     
     JOEY walks by on his way to another room, but stops to watch.
     
     LENORE is not a fight fan, but is caught up in the fight,
     anyway.
     
                     LENORE
           Look at that. The sonofabitch is
           outboxing Robinson.
     
                     JOEY
           I can't believe he's getting that
           jab in.
     
     The bell sounds, and a Pabst commercial comes on:
     
                     PABST COMMERCIAL
           "Friend, the quality that has
           carried Pabst Blue Ribbon around
           the world is yours for the asking.
           Next time that friendly bartender
           says, 'What'll you have?' give him
           the answer the whole world gives,
           Pabst Blue Ribbon!"

     TONY is wiping JAKE off in his corner.
     
                     JAKE
           He ain't hurting me, but I can't
           get him down.
     
                     TONY
           Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab,
           jab. You're ahead on points.
     
     In the other, SUGAR RAY'S TRAINER pats down ROBINSON's
     pompadour as he says:
     
                     S.R.'S TRAINER
           He's going, Sugar. He's old. He
           ain't Jake LaMotta no more. Make
           your move, Sugar. Kill him!
     
     ROBINSON nods.
     
     The bell sounds and the FIGHTERS step onto the canvas. They
     look at each other before the boxing starts -- they both know
     the inevitable outcome. ROBINSON smiles.

     ROBINSON makes his move. His arms are a blur, swinging
     rapidly but accurately.
     
     JOEY and LENORE are suddenly silent.
     
                     TV ANNOUNCER
           LaMotta's on queer street, but he's
           still standing. Robinson throws a
           right, a left, a right, a right and
           a right again! How can LaMotta stay
           on his feet?
     
     On the TV, WE SEE that ROBINSON has JAKE up against the
     ropes. He's giving JAKE a pier six beating. It's the Fox
     fight for real.
     
     JAKE's face is so soaked in blood that it's impossible to
     pinpoint the cuts.
     
                     TV ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
           No man can take this kind of
           punishment. LaMotta is just a rag
           doll now. God knows what's holding
           him up. This is an historic
           beating. Sugar Rav staggers LaMotta
           with a left and comes across with a
           blackjack punch to the champion's
           head. The referee is stepping in,
           Robinson has LaMotta on the ropes.
           That's it! Sugar Ray Robinson,
           former welterweight champion, has
           taken the middleweight crown from
           Jake LaMota.
     
     As the REFEREE stops the fight, JOEY sighs with relief.
     
     INT. CHICAGO STADIUM - NIGHT
     
     LAMOTTA, a bloody and beaten fighter, walks over to the
     victorious ROBINSON and puts his arm on his shoulder.
     
                     JAKE
           You never knocked me down. You
           could never knock me down.
     
     ROBINSON, receiving congratulations from every direction,
     takes time to turn to JAKE and say:
     
                     ROBINSON
           So what?
     
     EXT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY (JUNE 2, 1954)
     
     ESTABLISHING SHOT. The house is quite large, and has
     beautiful landscaping and a swimming pool.
     
     INT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
     
     JAKE, wearing sportclothes that can't hide his paunch, and
     VICKIE, wearing a dress and looking her best, sit in the
     living room with their THREE CHILDREN (the TWO BOYS, and also
     a GIRL, about two years old).
     
     A still PHOTOGRAPHER clicks pictures of JAKE and VICKIE as
     TWO REPORTERS talk with JAKE.
     
                     JAKE
           I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's
           TV bout 'cause I can't make the
           weight. I'm fighting at light
           heavyweight, and I still can't make
           the weight.
     
                     REPORTER
           Does that mean...
     
                     JAKE
           It means I'm through with boxing.
           I'm tired with tryin' to make the
           weight anymore. I'm sick of
           thinkin' about weight, weight,
           weight.
     
                     REPORTER
           You sound bitter.
     
                     JAKE
           Why should I be bitter? Boxing's
           been good to me. I got a nice
           house, three kids, a beautiful wife
           -- take a picture of her. Vickie.
     
     VICKIE poses dutifully.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been
           Mrs. America if I didn't pull her
           outa the contest. Didn't want her
           wearing a swimsuit for nobody but
           me.
     
                     REPORTER
           What do you think of Jake's
           retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
     
     JAKE cuts in:
     
                     JAKE
           I also bought a club on Collins
           Avenue, and I'm gonna open it real
           soon. Know what I'm gonna call it?
           "Jake LaMotta's."
     
     INT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - NIGHT (1956)
     
     JAKE, an empty glass in his hand, stands on the bar platform.
     He's wearing a white tuxedo jacket with a red rose in the
     lapel. His tuxedo shirt is stained. He continues his
     monologue.
     
                     JAKE
           Valentine's Day. The anniversary of
           the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
           Robinsin didn't use a machine gun
           but it was still a massacre...
                (takes another drink)
           Actually, I was doin' okay at
           first. In fact, by the end of the
           fifth round I really had him
           worried --- he thought he killed
           me. You know, I could keep tellin'
           you this brilliant material all
           night -- but you'd only laugh. Now
           I'm gonna sing. -- Any requests? I
           mean, besides "don't"!
                (then to piano player)
           -- In the key of H.
                (then to audience)
           You're laughin'. Give me the right
           key and I'll play in anybody's
           flat! I sing for a reason. When I
           finish, you'll be so sobered up,
           we'll sell a lot of booze.
     
     JAKE's onstage version of "That's Entertainment" differs from
     the backstage version. It's not just that he's a little drunk
     -- no, his voice is defiant, sadly defiant. He is singing at
     the PATRONS rather than to them.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           "When the fighter's not engaged in
           his employment, his employment,
           although he was Champ and quite the
           rage, he must go somewhere else to
           seek employment, seek employment.
           So what does he do? He goes upon
           the stage and meets his true
           adversaries, all you members of the
           human race. But a fighter's life is
           not a bowl of cherries, still I'd
           rather have an egg than a fist upon
           my face... That's Entertainment!
     
     JAKE brings the BAND to a crescendo with a wave of his hand,
     then silences it. The spotlight goes out and there is a
     hearty round of applause.
     
     JAKE receives the kisses, glad handshakes and congratulations
     of the PATRONS as he works his way around the club.
     
     JAKE's new friends love him. They are PARTY GIRLS, SPORTS
     FIGURES, COLUMNISTS, MOBSTERS, B ACTORS, and OTHER
     "CELEBRITIES."
     
     JAKE poses for a still with TWO BUXOM YOUNG LOVELIES. ONE
     GIRL giggles as he fondles her. After the flash goes off, the
     GIRLS admire his "small, delicate" hands.
     
     JAKE steps over to a table and greets J.R., a newspaper
     columnist, and his COMPANIONS.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           J.R., glad you could make it.
     
                     J.R.
           You were great, Jake. Just like old
           times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't
           here tonight. Oh Jake, this is
           State's Attorney Bronson and his
           wife.
     
     JAKE shakes his hand, then holds it up -- showing an empty
     palm.
     
                     JAKE
                (joking)
           Sorry, empty! Heh, heh! Oh, I
           didn't mean that. If I don't give
           your husband no money, he won't
           have enough to buy you a drink. To
           show you I'm a nice guy, this one's
           on me. The last one was your
           payment for this month.
     
     BRONSON is embarrassed. He doesn't think the joke is funny,
     but he manages a smile. His WIFE gives a nervous laugh. JAKE
     leans over and kisses her.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           You're a good sport, lady.
     
                     J.R.
           I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in
           '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were
           great.
     
                     JAKE
           Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
     
                     J.R.
           Where's your wife, Jake?
     
                     JAKE
           Do you think I'd let her in a place
           like this with guys like you
           hangin' around?
     
     JAKE feigns a few jabs, and they all laugh. He walks off.
     
     As JAKE leaves, J.R. whispers to his FRIEND:
     
                     J. R.
           You ought to see his wife.
     
     JAKE steps over to a table where some of the "BOYS" are
     sitting. RICKY is the Miami 1956 version of Salvy.
     
                     JAKE
           Hey, Ricky, glad you came.
     
                     RICKY
           Wouldn't miss it, Jake.
     
     JAKE calls a WAITRESS over.
     
                     JAKE
           Hey, honey, give these fellas a
           round on me. I can tell they're
           gonna be regular customers.
     
     The WAITRESS says to a clearly underaged GIRL:
     
                     WAITRESS
           I'll have to ask for your I.D.
     
     JAKE leans over and gives the young GIRL a long kiss on the
     lips. She enthusiastically reciprocates.
     
                     JAKE
           Whew! Any girl that can kiss like
           that can drink in my club any time!
     
     They all laugh as JAKE moves on. The life of the party.
     
     EXT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - DAY
     
     JAKE, hungover, his tux wrinkled, walks out of the club to
     the adjacent parking lot.
     
     VICKIE is sitting in her yellow Cadillac outside the Club.
     The curbside window is halfway up. She calls to him:
     
                     VICKIE
           Jake.
     
     JAKE, chagrined, steps over to the car.
     
                     JAKE
           I'm sorry. I had to work late last
           night. Slept at the club.
     
                     VICKIE
           I'm leaving your Jake.
     
                     JAKE
           Sure, what else is new?
     
                     VICKIE
           No. This time it's true. I didn't
           bother to tell you until I had
           everything worked out.
     
     JAKE tries to open the door. It's locked.
     
                     JAKE
           Open the door, Vickie.
     
                     VICKIE
           No. I won't talk to you where you
           can use your hands on me.
     
                     JAKE
           Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
     
                     VICKIE
           I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting
           a divorce. I'm getting custody of
           the kids.
     
                     JAKE
           Aw, c'mon, Vick --
     
                     VICKIE
           I'm sick of it. I can't watch you
           this way. You're too drunk all the
           time. There's too many girls. I
           can't... I don't wanna talk about
           it. I made up my mind.
     
     JAKE tries to reach in the window, but VICKIE hits the power
     switch, closing it and catching his hand. She now has to yell
     to him:
     
                     VICKIE (CONT'D)
           You got three days to get your
           stuff out of the house. After that,
           the cops will be there. I have the
           kids with me. I never want to see
           you again.
     
     VICKIE turns her face and drives away.
     
     JAKE grabs at the Cadillac, but it is bigger and stronger
     than him.
     
     JAKE is left alone in the parking lot. The car is gone.
     
     INT. JAKE'S OFFICE - DAY (JAN. 9, 1957)
     
     JAKE has an office above the lounge. Ever since VICKIE left,
     it's also been his apartment.
     
     The place is a mess. JAKE sends his laundry out when he runs
     out of clean clothes. Dirty socks, shorts and shirts are
     scattered randomly. Empty whiskey bottles on the desk, empty
     beer cans in the wastebasket.
     
                     1ST DEPUTY
           Let's go, Jake, wake up!
     
                     JAKE
           Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
     
                     1ST DEPUTY
                (showing badge)
           We're from...
     
                     JAKE
                (interrupting)
           I know where you're from. You guys
           look the same every place.
     
                     1ST DEPUTY
           They wanna talk to you.
     
                     JAKE
           About what?
     
                     1ST DEPUTY
           I don't run the joint. They just
           told me to bring you in.
     
                     JAKE
           For what?
     
                     2ND DEPUTY
           C'mon, get dressed.
     
     JAKE hunts for his clothes.
     
                     JAKE
           Hey, I'm a big tax payer down here.
           Don't that entitle me to some
           information what this is all about?
     
     The SECOND DEPUTY shows JAKE a photo.
     
                     2ND DEPUTY
           You recognize this girl? She been
           in the club?
     
                     JAKE
           I dunno.
     
                     2ND DEPUTY
           She says you introduced her to men.
     
                     JAKE
           I introduced a lot of people to
           men. So what? What does that mean?
     
                     2ND DEPUTY
           She's fourteen.
     
     CLOSE UP of picture.
     
     EXT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY
     
     JAKE, wearing a suit, walks up to the door and pushes the
     bell.
     
     VICKIE opens the door and looks at him over the chain.
     
                     JAKE
           Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
     
                     VICKIE
           Are you drunk?
     
                     JAKE
           No. Open the door.
     
     JAKE tries to touch her face through the doorway crack, but
     she steps back.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           Please, Vick. I won't bother you.
           I'm out on bail. You can send the
           kids next door. I just gotta pick
           one thing up, then I'll get outa
           here.
     
     VICKIE thinks a moment, then opens the door and lets JAKE in.
     
                     VICKIE
           The kids are sleeping.
     
                     JAKE
           I promise I just gotta pick up one
           thing.
     
                     VICKIE
           All right, just don't make any
           noise.
     
     INT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY
     
     JAKE walks directly past VICKIE into the living room. VICKIE
     watches from a safe distance.
     
     JAKE removes his jewel-studded championship belt from the
     glass bookcase and carries it into the kitchen.
     
     In the kitchen, he takes a hammer and screwdriver out of a
     drawer, places the belt on the counter top, and starts
     digging the jewels out of it.
     
     VICKIE appears in the doorway.
     
                     VICKIE
           What are you doing?
     
                     JAKE
           I need ten thousand dollars. My
           lawyer says if we can spread ten
           thousand bucks around, we can get
           the case dropped.
     
                     VICKIE
           But they don't have a case against
           you.
     
                     JAKE
                (digging at the belt)
           Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a
           14-year-old testify in court? Did
           you see the papers? "LaMotta on
           Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot
           at the Champ.
     
                     VICKIE
           Jake, be careful! What're you doing
           to the belt?!
     
                     JAKE
           Don't make no difference no more.
     
                     VICKIE
           Can't you get the money from your
           friends?
     
                     JAKE
           What friends?
     
     JAKE, frustrated by his task, turns the belt over and hammers
     at it. The jewels scatter across the counter top and floor.
     JAKE collects the jewels and puts them in his pockets.
     
     INT. JEWELRY SHOP - DAY
     
     JAKE stands at the counter of a small jewelry store. The
     JEWELER examines the stones.
     
                     JEWELER
           Didn't you also wish to sell the
           Championship Belt, Mr. LaMotta?
     
                     JAKE
           That's it. Those are the jewels
           that were in the belt.
     
                     JEWELER
           But where's the belt?
     
                     JAKE
           You want the jewels or the belt?
     
                     JEWELER
           Both. These stones are worth about
           fifteen hudred dollars, but the
           belt of a champion is a very rare
           item. The belt with the stones
           untouched would have been worth
           near five thousand dollars.
     
     JAKE seems to despair of the whole thing: the belt, the
     attempt to raise 10 g's, the vice case, his life.
     
     EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY
     
     JAKE places a call from a booth outside the jewelry store.
     
                     JAKE
                (on phone)
           I can't raise the ten thousand.
           Fuck 'em. Let 'em put me on trial.
     
     INT. BARBIZON DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Same as Scene 1.
     
     JAKE, 42 years old, continues to rehearse. He is seated
     across from a mirror.
     
                     JAKE
           So there I am in the can... and not
           the one that says "gentlemen" on
           the door. I'm talkin' about jail!
           Down south!
           I mean, jail up north is gotta be
           like summer camp compared to jail
           down in cracker country. And if
           you're a guy like me, you ain't got
           a chance in a place like that.
           Especially if you're Italian... you
           come from the Bronx... and you're
           an ex-champ. As soon as they saw
           me... soon as they heard me... I
           know I'm in trouble. To me, they
           got an accent, and to them, I got
           an accent! You gotta get the
           picture -- I'm big, I got small
           hands, I walk like I'm still in the
           ring... the balls of my feet pop up
           and down, you know... and whenever
           I get the chance, I read a lot. So
           naturally, takin' all this into
                                           co
           sideration, they figure it adds up
           to one thing -- I'm queer! Now I
           didn't mind too much when they
           called me "Queer" or "Mr. Tough
           Guy" or "Yankee Punk"... But one
           day these screws got to me... I was
           workin' on the work gang, pickin'
           up some trees that were knocked
           down by a storm or somethin' and
           puttin' 'em on this truck. All of a
           sudden... one of the trees slipped
           and fell on me and pinned me to the
           ground. I'm lyin' there with a tree
           across my chest! This screw walks
           over, takin' his time, he looks
           down at me and says, "Well, Champ
           Pimp... you lyin' down on the job
           again?"! They got a great sense of
           humor when they're standin' there
           with a gun in their arms and you
           got a tree on your chest! So I look
           up at him and say, "Oh, this
           tree... it fell on me." And he
           says, "Oh, I'm sorry... If I'd have
           known, I would've yelled 'timber'"
           I said, "Hey, look... it hurts. I
           think maybe I broke somethin'!" He
           says, "Well, whaddaya know... Champ
           PImp's got himself a boo-boo." Then
           I got as stupid as him. I said, "If
           I'm Champ Pimp... how 'bout givin'
           me the money you made last night?"!
           Then another screw comes over and
           says, "This Yankee creep givin' you
           trouble?" -- What kind of trouble?
           What am I gonna do -- hit 'em with
           the tree? Now anybody else in their
           right mind would've said, "No sir,
           I wouldn't think of giving any of
           you gentlemen trouble... I just
           want to serve my time and get the
           hell out of here as soon as I can."
           That's anybody else. When I said
           it... it was a little different.
           "You stupid cracker... take your
           hands off me or I'll get up and
           kick your brains out -- but first
           you gotta bend over so I can find
           'em!" Next thing I know I'm in the
           hole. Solitary confinement. All my
           life I had guys in my corner
           yellin' "Go get 'em, jake... kill
           'em! You're the greatest." Now
           there's nobody rootin' for me. But
           it wasn't so bad. I learned things
           there. I learned how to scratch a
           calendar on the wall. I never knew
           how to do that before. Now I know.
           Monday is one scratch. Tuesday is
           two scratches. Wednesday is three
           scratches. And so on. Except for
           Sundays. Sundays is no scratches.
           Sundays rested.
     
     INT. DADE COUNTY STOCKADE - DAY
     
     The CAMERA TRACKS down the lonely corridors of the Dade
     County Prison. Empty faces stare out from behind the bars.
     
     JAKE is led down a long corridor by TWO GUARDS. His hands and
     legs are manacled and chained.
     
     The GUARDS, redneck screws both, take special pleasure in
     working JAKE over.
     
     They take JAKE to the "Hole" -- solitary confinement.
     
     ONE of the GUARDS unmanacles JAKE.
     
     Both GUARDS push JAKE into the cell and slam the door.
     
     INT. THE HOLE - DAY OR NIGHT
     
     A thin slit provides the only light in JAKE's cell.
     
     The rough cement walls are covered with obscure graffiti. The
     8x8x8 room features only a cot and a toilet.
     
     The room is mostly darkness. Sounds are more tangible here
     than sights.
     
     WE SEE JAKE's body as it passes through the slit of light.
     
     JAKE crouches into the corner away from the light. As WE SEE
     JAKE's face, the following MONTAGE images appear.
     
     (There will be contrasting sound effects accompanying the
     images: for example, the image of JAKE hitting VICKIE might
     be accompanied by the sounds from a love scene between them.)
     
     A) 1940s black and white pornography: partially clothed men
     and women engaged in explicit sex acts.
     
     B) Boxing magazines: fighters' beaten and bloody faces. A
     body building ad: Charles Atlas raises his muscled biceps.
     
     C) Li'l Abner comics; Daisy Mae's tits seem about to fall
     free.
     
     D) Reprise from earlier scene: Back in JAKE and IRMA's old
     apartment, JOEY, using a towel as a glove, punches JAKE in
     the face.
     
     E) A 1934 "OLDER GIRL" sashays into the candy store in
     flickering 8mm black and white footage. WE SEE ohter Bronx
     PRETEEN GIRLS walking, smiling.
     
     F) At Shorehaven pool, JAKE and JOEY, in bathing suits, are
     sleeping in the sun next to each other. OTHER BATHERS are
     around, also taking in the sun.
     
     G) Reprise from earlier scene: As in D, JOEY hits JAKE in the
     face again.
     
     WE SEE again the image of JAKE's face as he sits in his cell.
     
     The MONTAGE continues:
     
     H) JANIRO's face at the weigh-in.
     
     I) JAKE throws JANIRO a kiss at the weigh-in.
     
     J) JAKE punches in JANIRO's face.
     
     K) A naked GIRL stands in the doorway of a bedroom.
     
     L) JAKE lies in bed with IRMA staring at the ceiling.
     
     M) VICKIE's pretty young face DOUBLE EXPOSES with SUGAR RAY
     ROBINSON's.
     
     N) DR. PINTO injects novacaine into JAKE's fists.
     
     O) Sitting in his corner of the ring, JAKE spits blood into a
     pail...
     
     P) Still in JAKE's corner: JOEY wipes off his brother's
     bloody face.
     
     Q) Still in JAKE's corner: There is an open cut over JAKE's
     eye. JOEY, rushing against time, sucks the blood from the
     wound as DR. PINTO begins to examine it.
     
     R) Still in JAKE's corner: JOEY puts the mouthpiece in JAKE's
     mouth. (SLOW MOTION)
     
     S) JAKE wins over CERDAN. JOEY, overenthusiastic, hits JAKE
     on the back of the head a little too hard. JAKE gives JOEY a
     quick look, but JOEY just embraces him.
     
     T) On a bed, a GIRL is going down on JOEY. The GIRL turns and
     looks up at JAKE. It's LINDA, the waitress from his club.
     JAKE stares.
     
     U) JAKE's fist hits LINDA's face.
     
     V) VICKIE playfully bends JAKE's hand back, pretending to
     break it.
     
     W) JAKE hits LINDA again. She cries.
     
     X) Repeat image N: DR. PINTO injects novocaine into JAKE's
     fists.
     
     WE SEE again the image of JAKE's face as he sits in his cell.
     
     The MONTAGE continues:
     
     Y) VICKIE is in her underwear in a bedroom. A pair of black
     arms come in and embrace her body.
     
     Z) CLOSE UP of JAKE; he reacts to this. He's in the ring with
     SUGAR RAY. He knocks SUGAR RAY out of the ring.
     
     AA) VICKIE again. JAKE approaches her from behind, pulls her
     head back by her hair, and slaps her.
     
     BB) THE ANNOUNCER points to SUGAR RAY as the winner.
     (Different fight.) CAMERA PANS to RAY, victorious, his arms
     up.
     
     CC) A bloodied JAKE comes over to SUGAR RAY and embraces him.
     
     WE ARE BACK WITH JAKE in the cell. He slowly starts to bang
     his head against the wall.
     
                     JAKE
                (murmuring)
           Why, why, why?
                (with each bang of his
                head)
           I'm a man, I'm a man. I'm no
           faggot. I'm not a faggot. Ma, why?
           What do they want? My cock's not
           enough. What do they want from me?
           Why? Ma? Why?
     
     JAKE is now smashing the wall with all his strength --
     vicious body punches.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           Why, why, why me? You took it away
           from me. They took everything away.
           What do they want from me? What the
           fuck do they want from me? I ain't
           bad. I ain't bad. I'm not that guy.
           I'm not that guy. I'm not a
           monster. I'm not an animal.
     
     JAKE breaks his knuckles; the pain and blood are unbearable.
     
     JAKE collapses to the concrete floor. His hands are smashed.
     He cries, then sobs.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           I'm not like that. Please. I'm not
           like that. Please. Please. Please.
     
     Then silence.
     
     We begin to hear: JAKE doing a monologue.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           And so, as Shakespeare said, I've
           been down so low there's nowhere
           else to go.
     
     INT. METROPOLE - NIGHT (1958)
     
     The Metropole is a club on 7th Avenue off Times Square.
     
     JAKE LAMOTTA, 36 years old and wearing a hip Fifties suit,
     continues his monologue.
     
                     JAKE
           Except here, gentlemen, with you
           bums. I call you "gentlemen"... but
           you know what you really are! You
           know, this place used to be pretty
           exclusive... now they got bouncers
           outside to throw the drunks in! My
           first night here I said to the
           boss, "Where's the toilet?" -- He
           said, "You're in it!" By the way,
           this engagement is just a stepping
           stone for me. If I do good here,
           I'm ready to get out of the
           business!
     
     The CROWD starts to shout: "Get the fuck off the stage!"
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           OK, OK, I know what you're waitin'
           for -- and from the looks of you,
           you been waitin' for it for a long
           time. I had my own joint in Miami
           Beach once... it was too high-class
           for you guys... we had a 50-cent
           minimum charge just to keep out the
           riff-raff!
     
     The CROWD continues to shout, as before, also shouting:
     "Bring out the girls!"
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           Hey, sorry. Here's your girls.
                (grabs his crotch)
           Yeah, she's here... just like it's
           advertised out front. She's come
           back. A girl who's seen the Lower
           Depths... who's been as far as I
           have in that direction. She's on
           her way back up now... give you an
           idea how low she was! Let's give
           her a warm welcome... make her glad
           she's back, boys. -- Miss Emma
           48's!
     
     JAKE gets off the stage as MISS EMMA 48's goes into her
     dance. He goes over to the bar and gets a drink. SEVERAL
     OLDER MEN in T-shirts - a disreputable looking lot - are at
     the bar.
     
     EXT. METROPOLE - NIGHT
     
     The Club is closing. JAKE and EMMA, the stripper, come out
     and walk by a delicatessen on their way to a parking lot.
     
     JAKE sees his brother JOEY enter the delicatessen.
     
                     JAKE
           Look, sweetie, be a good girl.
           Here's some money. Take a cab. Go
           home by yourself. Just wanna walk
           around a little, sort of unwind.
           OK?
     
                     EMMA
           Will I see you later?
     
                     JAKE
           Yeah. I dunno... I'll call you.
     
     JAKE goes to the parking lot entrance as EMMA gets into a
     cab.
     
                                         DISSOLVE TO:
     
     EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
     
     It's about twenty minutes later.
     
     DOLLY INTO A MEDIUM SHOT of JAKE waiting by the parking lot.
     He looks at the delicatessen.
     
     JOEY finally comes out carrying a paper bag. Not noticing
     JAKE, he walks right past him to his car which is parked near
     the rear of the outdoor lot.
     
                     JAKE
           Hey, Joey --
     
     JAKE walks towards JOEY with his hand outstretched.
     
     JOEY looks at JAKE. Silence. JOEY turns his back and starts
     to get into his car.
     
     JAKE runs over to JOEY and grabs his shoulder.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           No, Joey, no. Look, wait a minute,
           please --
     
     JOEY looks at JAKE like he's shit, throws JAKE's hand off his
     shoulder, and starts to get into his car again.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           Aw, Joey --
     
     JAKE stops JOEY from getting into his car. He puts his hand
     on JOEY's shoulder again.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           You're right. You're perfectly
           right. You got every right in the
           world to hate my guts.
     
     JOEY pulls away from JAKE's hand, and tries to put the paper
     bag into the front seat of the car.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           No, please. I know I was a
           cocksucker. You're right. I shoulda
           never raised my hands to you.
     
     JOEY half pushes JAKE away, and begins to get into his car
     again.
     
     JAKE pulls JOEY by the arm.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           No, Joey, listen to me --
     
     JAKE pulls too hard, causing JOEY to drop the paper bag to
     his feet. The containers of coffee and tea in the bag break
     open and splatter JOEY's pants legs.
     
     JOEY stares down at his pants, then up at JAKE. Suddenly, he
     belts JAKE with a left and a right to the jaw. JAKE is taken
     by surprise, and backs off to get his own hands up.
     
     JOEY keeps pouring it on. JAKE drops his hands and takes it.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           Go ahead.
                (gets punched)
           Hit me again.
                (gets punched)
           I deserve it...
                (gets punched)
           Pay me back...
                (gets punched)
           More...
                (gets punched)
     
     JOEY stops in mid-punch and stares at JAKE. He can't figure
     it out.
     
     JAKE nods and tries to smile, but starts to cry instead.
     
                     JAKE (CONT'D)
           More. Go ahead, Joey. I deserve it.
     
     JOEY pauses, then finally throws a very weak punch to JAKE's
     shoulder.
     He leaves his hand there -- then, uncurls his fist -- and
     finally puts his hand around JAKE's neck as tears start to
     fill his eyes.
     
     JOEY hugs JAKE close to him, crying.
     
     They hug each other, both crying. They don't say anything.
     
     EXT. BARBIZON PLAZA THEATER - NIGHT (1964)
     
     The theater lights are flashing.
     
     This may not be Broadway, but it's a long way from the
     Metropole. The entrance to the Barbizon looks out on the
     corner of 6th Avenue and Central Park South.
     
     A stand-up billboard in front of the theater advertises "An
     Evening with Jake LaMotta." The billboard also lists the
     authors whose works will be performed: Paddy Chayevsky, Rod
     Serling, Shakespeare, Bud Schulberg, Tennessee Williams.
     
     INT. BARBIZON DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Same as Scenes One and Eighty-One.
     
     JAKE is alone preparing to go onstage. He rehearses.
     
                     JAKE
           You know, I'm not a philosopher or
           anything like that but I been
           around a little and the way I look
           at it is -- We're, all of us,
           lookin' for the same thing: a shot
           at the title. No matter what you
           wanta be... you wanta shot at bein'
           the best. Well, I had mine and
           it'll always be in the record
           books... it don't make no
           difference what happens to me from
           here on in -- I got my shot and
           that's a fact. Some guys weren't
           that lucky... like the one Marlon
           Brando played in "On the
           Waterfront" -- an up and comer
           who's now a down and outer. You
           remember... there was this scene in
           the back of the car with his
           brother Charlie, a small-time
           racket guy, and it went somethin'
           like this -- "It wasn't him,
           Charlie. It was you. You 'member
           that night in the Garden you came
           down my dressing room and said.
           'Kid, this ain't your night.
           We're going for the price on
           Wilson.' You 'member that? 'This
           ain't your night!' My night -- I
           coulda taken Wilson apart! So what
           happens? He gets the title shot
           outdoors on the ballpark, and what
           do I get? A one-way ticket to
           Palookaville. I never was no good
           after that night. It was like a
           peak you reach. Then it went
           downhill. It was you, Charlie. You
           was my brother, Charlie. You
           shoulda looked out for me a little
           bit. You shoulda taken care of me
           just a little bit so I wouldn't
           have to take them dives for the
           short end money... You don't
           understand! I coulda had class. I
           coulda been a contender. I coulda
           been somebody -- instead of a bum,
           which is what I am. Let's face it.
           It was you, Charlie."
     
     A shadow goes by the frame; it's a STAGEHAND.
     
                     STAGEHAND (O.S.)
           Hey Jake, how you doing?
     
     The shadow exits.
     
                     JAKE
           How long do I have?
     
     The shadow pops in again.
     
                     STAGEHAND (O.S.)
           About five minutes
     
     The shadow exits.
     
                     JAKE
           OK.
     
     JAKE pauses, then starts to shadow-box in his dressing room.
     
     His breath comes in quick gasps. His feet pop up and down
     like they were on canvas. His tiny fists jerk forward with
     short bursts of light.
     
     Still alive. Still a contender. A 42-year-old man fighting
     for his shot.
     
     The CAMERA DOLLIES into a FULL SHOT of his fists as they hit
     the empty air -- in and out of the frame.
     
     This quote appears: (Music in)
                 
     "Verily, verily I say unto thee,
       Except a man be born again,
       He can not enter into the kingdom of heaven..."
     
                                                      John 3-3
     
     The CAMERA goes into DARKNESS.
     
     The END CREDITS roll up.
     
                            THE END
