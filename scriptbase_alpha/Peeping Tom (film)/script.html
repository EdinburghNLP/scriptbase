               Leo Marks



               The screen remains dark for a moment.

               In the darkness WE HEAR the film's THEME MUSIC - a gentle 
               whirring purring noise. Nothing to be alarmed about. It 
               might be a small contented motor.

<b>               FADE IN:
</b>
<b>               EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT
</b>
               LONG SHOT of the solitary figure of a WOMAN standing 
               professionally alone at the end of the street.

               It is a bright, still night. We can HEAR the Woman whistling 
               'Stardust' merrily to herself.

               CAMERA TRACKS around her. A Man's footsteps are overlaid.

               We HEAR the Man start to whistle 'Stardust' under his breath - 
               haltingly at first, then in time with the Woman.

               As we approach, she glances at us over her shoulder - then 
               turns round for a better look.

               Her whistling stops - so, at the same moment, does the 
               man's.

               CLOSE SHOT of DORA - a plump, attractive brunette - still 
               young enough to need two glances at the customers.

               She smiles at us - and is pleased with the reception. She 
               hesitates for a long moment, weighing us up carefully... 
               and then - half defiantly, half expecting to be laughed 
               at.

<b>                                     DORA
</b>                         It'll be two quid...

               Evidently we have two quid.  

               She beams with relief - throws her fur over her shoulders, 
               jerks her head towards the right - and sets off.

               CAMERA TRACKS after her.  Overlaid is the sound of the 
               man's footsteps.

               Dora resumes her whistling. So, under his breath, does the 
               man who is following her.

<b>               EXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT
</b>
               A wider street than the last - but just as empty.  

               Dora sways her way towards a small house. CAMERA FOLLOWS 
               at a respectful distance.

               CAMERA PANS from Dora's hips to an overflowing dustbin.  

               CLOSE SHOT of a man's hand throwing something into the 
               dustbin. It is an empty packet marked Kodak Film.  CAMERA 
               PANS to Dora's house. It stands next to a chemist shop.

               Dora climbs the few steps which lead to her front door - 
               glances round at us encouragingly - then unlocks the door.

<b>               INT. HALLWAY OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               She switches on a light - and hurries up a flight of stairs. 

               CAMERA TRACKS after her.

               She changes her tune to 'Goodnight Sweetheart'... and so - 
               under his breath - does the Man who is following her.  

               A woman with hair like a two-toned car comes down the 
               stairs, winks at Dora - looks at us for a moment with great 
               curiosity... winks... then passes out of camera.

               Dora reaches the landing - we are close behind her.

<b>               INT. LANDING OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               Dora unlocks the door of her room - and goes inside.

<b>               INT. DORA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               She switches on the light, throws her fur onto a chair, 
               lights the gas fire  then turns round.

               CLOSE SHOT of Dora. She holds out her hand-smiling.

               And suddenly. There is a gentle whirring purring sound.

               CAMERA HOLDS ON Dora - she is staring at something with 
               great curiosity.

               It turns quickly to bewilderment - and the bewilderment to 
               fear. She steps back from CAMERA - but CAMERA won't have 
               it.

               Dora is now staring at something in horror - she opens her 
               mouth to scream - a shadow falls across her face.

               The sound purrs on.

<b>                                                              FADE OUT: 
</b>
<b>               FADE IN:
</b>
<b>               BLACK AND WHITE FILM SEQUENCE
</b>
               The solitary figure of Dora standing professionally alone 
               at the end of a street. WE SEE her turn towards CAMERA - 
               and smile at us.

               We are watching her on a 16mm screen - projected in BLACK 
<b>               AND WHITE.
</b>
               CAMERA PULLS BACK to show the surround in natural colour.

<b>               INT. MARK'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               A darkened room in natural COLOUR. The movie screen images 
               are in BLACK AND WHITE.  

               We can SEE the back of a Man's head as he bends intently 
               over a projector. He is watching Dora on the screen. He is 
               breathing quickly.

               We see Dora's hips waggling their way home.

               The Man raises his head, so that we cannot see the screen.

               When he lowers it again, we see the Woman with the two-
               toned hair winking at Dora... then we see Dora throwing 
               her fur onto a chair - and turning towards us.

               WE SEE her staring at something in bewilderment... then 
               backing away from CAMERA in fear.

               WE HEAR the Man breathing as if at the end of a very long 
               race.

               As Dora opens her mouth to scream, and a shadow falls across 
               her face - the title:

<b>                                      PEEPING TOM
</b>
               Blots out what is happening to her.

               OTHER CREDITS FOLLOW... behind them we can see Dora's hands 
               pushing something away.

               Before the DIRECTOR'S CREDIT:

<b>                                                                 CUT TO:
</b>
<b>               EXT. A PARK - NIGHT
</b>
               It is very dark.

               CLOSE SHOT of a stack of deck chairs.

               Two forms behind it - a MAN'S and a WOMAN'S.

               They are intertwined and motionless... suddenly a brilliant 
               shaft of light is trained onto them.

               Overlaid is a gentle, whirring sound.

               CAMERA PANS quickly to a nearby tree.

               CLOSE SHOT of the lens of a cine-camera - the motor 
               purring... a blinding spotlight.

               CAMERA PANS to the couple - the whirring of the camera is 
               overlaid.

               The Man leaps up - shielding his eyes against the light.

               He advances towards the tree.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         Hey, you peeping...

               The spotlight goes out. There is the sound of footsteps 
               running away — and the night is at peace again.

               And now WE SEE who DIRECTED the picture.

<b>                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>               LONG SHOT. AMBULANCE - DAY
</b>
               It is standing in the roadway outside Dora's house.

               WE SEE it through the finder of a small cine-camera.

<b>               EXT. STREETS BY DORA'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
               A crowd has gathered outside the house - and we are watching 
               them from a corner of the street (ALWAYS THROUGH THE FINDER-
<b>               MATTE).
</b>
               WE SEE several Policemen holding back the crowd as two 
               Ambulance Men hurry into the house, carrying an empty 
               stretcher.

               Gentle, whirring sound is overlaid.

               WE SEE children staring curiously into the empty ambulance - 
               and a group of Women talking excitedly to a Reporter.

               CLOSE SHOT of a SMALL MAN looking at us curiously as he 
               approaches (FILLING THE SCREEN WITHIN THE MATTE).

<b>                                     SMALL MAN

               The finder is lowered.

               CLOSE SHOT of a Young Man (MARK) sighting a cine-camera. 

               He lowers the camera - and turns politely to his 
               interrogator.

               He seems to have slight difficulty informing his words.

<b>                                     MARK

               Mark smiles at him pleasantly.

               The Ambulance Men come out of the house carrying the 
               stretcher... there is a body on it covered by a sheet.  
               Mark raises his cine-camera and photographs them. He 
               photographs the ambulance as it drives off. He photographs 
               the Policemen dispersing the crowd. He photographs his 
               Interrogator, who gladly poses for him.

               Then he slings his camera over his shoulder, and strolls 
               away.

               Her photograph is on the front page of a newspaper.  

               Above it is a caption: BRUTALLY MURDERED.

               Mark is staring at a newspaper in the window of a small 
               newsagent's shop.  

               He glances distastefully at an array of film magazines - 
               showing actresses showing everything - then hurries into 
               the shop.

               Mark turns round.

               Mr. Peters hesitates, drumming his fingers on the counter.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He starts to drum his fingers on a

               He stops drumming his fingers. So, at that moment, does 
               Mark.

               Mark busies himself sorting some newspapers. 

               A whole row of Doras smile up at him.

               The Elderly Gentleman hesitates - glancing at Mark's back.

               From under the counter he produces a thick book. Mark turns 
               round.

               From his POV WE SEE the Elderly Gentleman open the book. 
               He - er- seems - er - more than a little interested.

               At the top of the staircase is a door. Mark and his camera 
               trudge towards it. The door opens suddenly. A vivacious 
               young redhead - Milly - pokes her head round. She has a 
               towel round her shoulders.

               From REVERSE ANGLE WE SEE Mark venture a shy smile at Milly. 
               Milly opens the door impatiently.

               Through the half-open door we catch a glimpse of a second 
               Girl (LORRAINE). She is staring out of a window, her back 
               to camera. She is naked except for a shawl draped round 
               her shoulders.  

               Mark enters the room... the door begins to close. CAMERA 
               TRACKS towards the door. On the threshold of the room, a 
               hood is thrown over our faces. THE SCREEN BLACKS OUT.

               In the darkness WE HEAR Milly's voice.

               Through the ground-glass of the camera WE SEE a SMALL 
               INVERTED IMAGE of Milly.

               The ground-glass camera begins travelling slowly down 
               Milly's back.

               CLOSE SHOT of Milly. She is on a couch, lying on her stomach 
               at a slightly oblique angle. All that WE CAN SEE are her 
               face and naked shoulders.

               From Milly's POV WE SEE Mark under the hood of an antiquated 
               camera.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's toes - in sandals, next to the tripod 
               of the camera. They start to wriggle. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Lorraine. We watch her in profile as she 
               stares out of the window - clutching her shawl. She has 
               outstandingly beautiful features. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is standing by the side of the 
               camera, studying us thoughtfully. He is holding a remote-
               control switch panel in his hand. He clicks off several 
               lights and then switches several others on... then he ducks 
               back under the hood.

               We join Mark under the hood.  

               WE SEE a small INVERTED IMAGE of Milly on the ground-glass. 
               Her shoulders are now white and glistening, her spine 
               caressed by shadows. She is staring into the camera.

               He adjusts the focus. We can see more clearly the contempt 
               on Milly's face.

               There is a gentle KNOCK at the door, and Mr. Peters enters. 
               He carries a tray of coffee. He keeps his eyes modestly 
               lowered.

               He lays the tray on a table, still keeping his eyes lowered, 
               and goes out.

               stiffens. Milly's voice is overlaid.

               Lorraine turns round.  

               The left side of her face is classical in its beauty. She 
               has a hare lip, which twists and distorts the whole of the 
               right side. Her eyes are large - and beautiful - and 
               defiant.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark looking at her.

               him in silence.

               Milly shrugs and reaches for the coffee pot.

               Overlaid is the gentle purring of a cine-camera.

               The hand filling the glass is a woman's (MRS. STEPHENS). 
               She is sitting in a high-backed chair, and we cannot see 
               her face. Over her shoulder we watch a party in progress. 
               A group of Young people have surrounded someone to whom 
               they are singing:

               CLOSE SHOT of 'dear HELEN'. A sensitive, intelligent, and 
               extremely attractive girl, who — as the encircling 
               youngsters now inform us in song - is:

<b>                                     YOUNG PEOPLE

                         She's got the key of the door,
                         She's never been twenty-one before.

               CLOSE SHOT of the glass by Mrs. Stephens' side. It is half 
               empty. An elderly lady leans across to her. She is Mrs. 
               Partridge, slightly high on a glass of sherry.

                         daughter, Mrs. Stephens.

               Mrs. Stephens grunts. Someone switches on a gramophone and 
               the young couples start dancing at once. Tony hurries up 
               to Helen.

               Helen goes towards him. A YOUNG MAN calls out sharply:

</b>                         Look!

               He is pointing at something out of camera. All heads - 
               except Mrs. Stephens' - follow the direction of his gaze.  
               Mrs. Stephens continues to sit motionless in the high-backed 
               chair.

               CAMERA PANS to the window. Mark is standing there.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at Mark. We watch him over her 
               shoulder - Tony's arm encircling it.

               The chap from upstairs presses his face to the window. 
               From his POV WE SEE Helen's eyes looking at him - the key 
               of the door in them - looking at him, not staring. Suddenly 
               the rest comes into focus - Tony's arm around Helen's 
               shoulder... the high-backed chair in the foreground with 
               the back of that motionless head... a young couple giggling 
               as they stare at him. Mark steps away, and the CAMERA PULLS 
               BACK with him.

               We catch a glimpse of the house - large, sprawling, but 
               with a touch of quality about it, in a quiet, unpretentious 
               street.

               Mark hurries towards a side entrance.

               refills it has begun to tremble.

               The lights are on.

               WE FOLLOW Mark (and his camera) along a small passage which 
               leads to the hall. The sound of a dance record can be heard. 
               Mark starts to whistle it under his breath.

<b>               INT. HALL - NIGHT
</b>
               Over his shoulder we see a staircase, and beyond it the 
               door of Helen's sitting room. The sound of Helen's party 
               fills the hall.

               Mark reaches the staircase. There is the sound of a door 
               opening. Helen's voice is overlaid:

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Thank you.

               He turns away.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Happy Birthday.

               He hurries up the stairs.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She stares after him for a moment. 
               Then returns thoughtfully to her party.

<b>                                                               FADE OUT:
</b>
               The screen remains dark for a moment. We are with Mark in 
               a darkened room. He is giving a film show - and we are the 
               screen.

<b>               INT. MARK'S DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               His cine-projector points straight at us.  A flickering 
               light shines in our eyes. We can see him crouching behind 
               the projector.

               Mark leans forward, watching the screen intently... 
               Perspiration trickles down his forehead. He is breathing 
               very quickly. The sounds of the party seep up from 
               downstairs - music, laughter, and a Girl's yelp.

               There is a knock on the door. Mark does not hear it.  

               CAMERA PANS to the door of the room. It is blacked-out 
               like a photographic dark-room. The knock is repeated.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He switches off the projector instantly.

               CAMERA PANS to an open cupboard in the corner.

               CLOSE SHOT of the shelves. They are stacked with spools of 
               film.

               CAMERA travels slowly over these spools. WE SEE Mark's 
               hand add two more to the collection; his Voice is overlaid.

               He closes the cupboard door.

<b>               INT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Mark comes out of the dark-room behind him - the light is 
               kept out by a baffle and a curtain. He has a pleasant, 
               normally untidy bedsitting room.

               He wipes his handkerchief across his forehead - then hurries 
               to the door. He opens it - Helen is standing there.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - shaking his head, smiling shyly.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen.

                         so I've brought you this.

               She holds out a plate on which is a piece of birthday cake.

</b>                         I'll... go first.

               He leads the way - she follows. For a moment the screen is 
               in darkness. A dark-room darkness.

<b>               INT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               We can HEAR - faintly — the dance music from downstairs.  
               There is a click - and the walls are suddenly bathed in 
               diffused light, throwing the room into delicate shadow. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round in amazement.

               As certain events of possible interest are to take place 
               in this room, here, in detail, is what amazes Helen.

               The room is the product of three rooms which have been 
               knocked into one. It is very large and extremely well 
               constructed (as we are soon to learn, it was originally a 
               laboratory). One half of the room is used for processing, 
               and the other half for filming - and for trade shows. The 
               two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perched 
               all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glinting 
               in the light.

               In the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a 
               'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls. There 
               are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of 
               equipment above the 'dry'.

               This part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frowning 
               in the ceiling above the benches.

               The other part of the room has a window at the far end of 
               it. Heavy drapes are putted across it.

               Mark's projector rests on a small table in front of the 
               16mm screen.  Two banks of floods and a variety of spots 
               light this part of the room. There is a small control panel 
               on the wall.  

               Some of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is old. 
               All of it glistens with the affection of its owner.

               There is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone 
               except an adult... the kind who starts to wonder who paid 
               for it all.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He stands by the lighting panel, 
               watching Helen.

               From his POV WE SEE her brushing the hair out of her eyes 
               as she looks slowly round. He brushes the hair out of his. 
               For a moment she turns her back to him. He presses a switch 
               on the wall. A gentle light ripples through the back of 
               Helen's hair.

               SHOT of Helen. She turns to him. She is very nearly at a 
               loss for words.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         This is so... well - so many 
                         things... but above all - it's

               She takes a final look round.

               He looks at her thoughtfully.

</b>                         All right!

               He crosses to the corner cupboard - opens the door.

               CLOSE SHOT of the cupboard.  WE SEE Mark's hand reach for 
               a spool of film... then hesitate, poised above another 
               spool.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - watching with interest.

               REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mark. He closes the cupboard, and 
               turns round... there is a spool of film in his hand.

               He walks slowly towards his projector... he seems — for 
               the moment — to have forgotten she is there.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - watching him thread the film into 
               the projector.

               He places a chair a few feet away from the screen - and, 
               with an oddly courteous bow, beckons her into it. She sits 
               down.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He looks at her intently for a moment - 
               then turns off the lights. Over Helen's shoulder We can 
               just make out the empty screen. Mark switches on the 
               projector.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - the light flickering on her face. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at Helen's face.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen. WE SEE her expression of surprise. 
               Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE the surprise growing. Over 
               Helen's shoulder we see the screen. We are looking at a 
               small boy. He is lying in his bed asleep. Although the 
               print is old, we can see that he is a remarkably handsome 
               boy.

</b>                         Mark, what a beautiful child.

               The boy turns restlessly in his sleep... one of his pillows 
               falls to the floor.

                         My Father. 

               A light - as if from a small torch — starts to shine on 
               the child's eyes. He moves restlessly.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         What a wonderful idea...

               The light plays on the child's left eye, then on his right. 
               It is growing brighter.

<b>                                     HELEN

               The child wakes up suddenly. He stares at something... 
               then starts to scream.

<b>                                     HELEN

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching her in silence.

</b>                         ...but what was that light?  ...The 
                         camera, I suppose?  

               Mark does not answer. The small screen is filled with the 
               face of the screaming, terrified child.

               (Mark's father now tries a not altogether successful 
               dissolve:)

               WE NOW SEE the little boy standing in front of a garden 
               wall. He tries hard to climb to the top of the wall, but 
               falls over. Helen laughs. Mark watches her in silence. 
               Small Mark tries again - and again - to scale the wall... 
               At last he succeeds.

<b>                                     HELEN

               WE SEE the little boy lying flat on the wall staring at 
               something... rapt, motionless.  

               The cine-camera which is taking this picture now tracks 
               rather clumsily towards the wall.

               HIGH ANGLE SHOT over the wall of what is fascinating young 
               Mark - A man and woman are lying on the ground, kissing. 

               The CINE-CAMERA PANS - again rather clumsily - to young 
               Mark... staring intently.

               The small screen begins to dissolve ...so does the large 
               one.

<b>               INT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               Over Mrs. Stephens' shoulder WE SEE the party in progress. 
               The glass by her side is full again. Tony is dancing with 
               an attractive blonde.

               The head nods.

               Tony advances reluctantly towards her.

               REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens.

               Over Tony's shoulder WE SEE a powerfully built and once 
               lovely woman.

               She is so perpetually drunk as almost to be sober. The few 
               movements she makes are slow - deliberate - and give nothing 
               away. The voice articulates so carefully that the slur 
               scarcely shows.

               The fact that she is blind almost helps to conceal the 
               fact that she is drunk. Her sightless eyes stare out the 
               camera as Tony reaches her.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen's eyes. The light from the projector 
               flickering into them.

</b>                         I hate people who chatter in films -

               She is leaning forward, her face cupped in her hand, 
               watching the small screen intently.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. His face is cupped in his hand as he 
               watches her intently.

               Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE Mark in the making.

               The child is again asleep... this time he is being 
               photographed from the head of the bed - the CAMERA POINTING 
<b>               STRAIGHT DOWN AT HIS FACE.

               A beam of light starts to shine onto his eyes, first onto 
               the left, then onto the right.

               Mark looks at her in silence.

               The boy moves restlessly, then turns over onto his face, 
               pulling the bedclothes round him. His right hand is limp 
               on the pillow. The light shines for a moment on this hand, 
               then goes out.  Helen half turns towards Mark.

               Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE something drop onto the child's 
               bed... something which stays quite still for a moment, 
               then starts crawling towards the counterpane. It is a small 
               lizard.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Mark, whatever is that?

               Her voice trails away. She stares - repelled and fascinated - 
               at the screen.

               WE SEE Mark reach for his cine-camera. 

               Over Helen's shoulder WE SEE the lizard reach the 
               counterpane. It stretches itself out on the floral design - 
               its body is pointed towards the child's hand.

               WE HEAR a click - and suddenly a spotlight falls onto 
               Helen's face.

               OVERLAID is the GENTLE PURRING of Mark's cine-camera. She 
               wheels towards him - blotting out the small screen.

               He switches off the spot... the purring of the camera dies 
               away. She turns towards the small screen.

               The small boy is sitting upright... screaming with terror... 
               there is no sign of the lizard.

               A handkerchief is thrown onto the boy's bed. He continues 
               crying - looking up into someone's face.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching the screen.

               We hear a man's deep voice overlaid.

               Small Mark reaches for the handkerchief and wipes his 
               eyes... his hands are trembling.

               The small screen trembles with them into a clumsy dissolve.

               From Helen's POV WE SEE the screen.

               Small Mark is wearing a dark suit and a black tie.

               He is standing at the foot of a four-poster bed, staring 
               at something in horror and disbelief... his hands clasp 
               the bedrail tightly.

               Slowly - very slowly - he walks towards the head of the 
               bed, staring.

               His lips begin to quiver. He bends forward over the bed. 
               WE CAN SEE the back of his bowed head.

               We catch a glimpse of a woman's hands folded in front of 
               her.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen.

               Suddenly - and healthily - his temper snaps.

               He pushes a lever on his projector as far forward as it 
               will go.

               The film is now shown at tremendous speed - We catch a 
               glimpse of a long line of cars.

               WE SEE a girl in a bikini by sand-dunes. Mark offers no 
               comment.

                         the previous sequence.

               He pulls back the lever of his projector... the film returns 
               to its normal speed.

               WE SEE the same attractive young woman standing in a garden. 
               She is holding a bewildered and defiant Mark by the hand.

               Suddenly the girl runs towards camera - leaving Mark 
               standing alone.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen watching intently.  It's out of focus!

               From Helen's POV WE SEE a tall man in a black coat walking 
               away from camera. He hurries towards small Mark - who 
               watches him anxiously.

                         honeymoon.

               The back of Mark's father suddenly obscures our view of 
               small Mark... all we can see is that tall figure looking 
               downwards standing very still.

               Camera wobbles - as if the person holding it is laughing.

               Mark stares at the blurred screen, perspiration trickling 
               down his forehead.

               The small screen comes back into focus - and suddenly our 
               camera rushes towards it.

               WE SEE a CLOSE SHOT of a CLOSE SHOT - and at the moment we 
               see it, Mark's Voice is overlaid... A whisper which echoes 
               round the room.

               We are looking at a close shot of a camera in a small boy's 
               hands.

               There is a single shrill chord of music on the sound track.

               CLOSE SHOT of the shelf which encircles Mark's room.  

               We are looking at the very same camera which the small boy 
               is holding.

               CLOSE SHOT of the camera in small Mark's hands.

               His father's finger points lo the view-finder.

               Small Mark stares into it. Small Mark begins to smile.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching himself being born.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen watching Mark.

               She turns to the projector - touches the wrong switch.

               Small Mark and his father go rapidly backwards.

               Mark turns off the projector abruptly. 

               The room is in darkness.

               WE CAN HEAR both of them breathing quickly. 

               The light goes on. Mark is standing by the exit - he keeps 
               his face averted.

               Helen walks slowly towards the exit. She glances round 
               once, over her shoulder, then goes into the other room. 

               Mark stares after her.

               She walks towards the door... turns round suddenly - almost 
               in anger.

               He turns round slowly. From his POV WE SEE the willingness 
               to understand on her face.

               She walks towards him... takes his handkerchief from his 
               jacket pocket and wipes his forehead.

               He puts his arm round Helen, and closes the door. 

               Mark stares after them, motionless.

               The CAMERA LINGERS on the birthday cake.

               As the light fades, a voice yells: Cut!

               HIGH ANGLE SHOT of a set showing part of a large West End 
               store.

               A blonde is lying unconscious in front of a lift - and a 
               crowd of extras surround her. 

               As the word 'cut' dies away, the extras relax - and the 
               blonde (DIANE ASHLEY) props herself onto her elbow, looking 
               towards the Director.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Director (ARTHUR BADEN) standing beside 
               the camera.

</b>                         OK. Print that one!

               He glances at the CHIEF CAMERAMAN (PHILIP TALE), who nods 
               his head in agreement.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark standing at the back of the camera crew. 
               He shakes his head in disagreement.

               The Chief Cameraman spots Mark's small mutiny and wags his 
               finger at him. As the Chief Cameraman turns away, Mark's 
               finger automatically wags back.

               CLOSE SHOT of Baden looking at his watch. He sighs, then 
               nods to the Assistant Director who stands beside him.

</b>                         All right, everyone! Back at two!

               Baden walks out without a word to anyone. A hubbub of 
               chatter breaks out. The unit downs tools and begins to 
               disperse.

               CLOSE SHOT of one of the extras (VIVIAN) - a small, 
               vivacious, brunette with delicate, attractive features.

               She edges towards the camera crew.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark watching her.

               Over his shoulder WE SEE Vivian glance towards him. He 
               nods almost imperceptibly.

               Vivian hurries towards the exit.

               Mark turns to a shelf behind him - picks up his cine-camera 
               and a little full string bag containing his lunch.

               She is leaning against a wall in a corner of an exterior 
               set - a Chinese temple or a medieval castle (or a 
               combination of each like a Pinewood drawing-room).  

               Beside her she has a small tape-recorder, or record-player. 
               We hear music - modem rhythms.

               There are several people strolling about - but no one in 
               the immediate vicinity. No one... except Mark.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - settling down on the other side of 
               the wall (where they can talk without being seen together).

               MR. JARVIS is immersed in reading a script... his eyes 
               race across the page.

               No reply.  Vivian hesitates... then edges slowly forward.

               Ahead of her are shadowy counters full of merchandise. 
               Beyond them is the door of the lift.

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian. She starts whistling nervously under 
               her breath.

               Very faintly overlaid is the sound of Mark whistling under 
               his.

               Vivian stops whistling - and so does Mark.

               and almost falls.

               Suddenly she is bathed in light.

               Mark puts the cine-camera and the black cloth bag on the 
               dolly, slowly mounts the platform, closes the blimp - and 
               swings the camera.

               We watch him from the top of the studio, from the door of 
               the studio, from the Director's chair. And finally WE WATCH 
               HIM from Vivian's POV. She stops dancing but the music 
               continues.

               He stares ahead of him, his mind far, far away... then 
               bends and looks into the finder.  

               There is a single harsh chord of music - and the screen 
               goes dark. It remains dark for a moment.

               Suddenly the darkness parts like curtains - and in the 
               centre WE SEE Vivian's face in the finder of the studio 
               camera. (Unlike the ground-glass of the newsagent's camera, 
               we see everything the right way up and in perfect 
               perspective.)

               Mark hooks a filler-light below the camera and switches it 
               on. He adjusts the finder until he has made of Vivian's 
               delicate features a radiant miniature.

               The miniature smiles shyly at him. She has stopped dancing 
               and is looking directly at the camera. Music continues.

               peers into the finder. (The camera dolly is on tracks - he 
               tracks forward.)

               In the finder WE SEE a large trunk - 'at greatly reduced

               From Vivian's POV WE SEE Mark leave the studio camera — 
               and hurry towards the trunks. She watches him wide-eyed.

<b>               INT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING
</b>
               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He raises his head slowly - and locks 
               the studio camera off. Then he walks slowly towards her.

               HIGH ANGLE SHOT of Mark walking towards Vivian.

               CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN to the trunk behind her. Mark's voice is 
               overlaid:

               CLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis.

<b>               INT. CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING
</b>
               The great man is poised for the kill. He is moving forward 
               stealthily... and suddenly breaks into a run. 

               CAMERA PANS - and WE SEE the object of his attentions. A 
               wisp of smoke is coming from behind an alcove.

               CLOSE SHOT of a Fireman - smoking a cigarette. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis - smoking!  

               CLOSE SHOT of the Fireman's terror as he sees Don Jarvis.

               The Fireman opens his mouth to explain — and smoke exudes.

</b>                         Come with me!

               The Fireman follows him meekly.

<b>               CAMERA PANS.
</b>
               So near - yet a lifetime away - a red light is burning 
               above a closed door.

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian - puzzled.

<b>               INT. STUDIO E. - EARLY EVENING
</b>
               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

               He is holding his cine-camera; fixed to it is a collapsible 
               tripod. 

               Suddenly he pulls one leg of the tripod out. WE SEE that a 
               very sharp spike protrudes from the end of it.

               From Mark's POV WE SEE Vivian looking at the spike.

               He raises it towards her - until the spike is only inches 
               from her throat.

<b>                                     VIVIAN

</b>                         But... there's something else...

               We can hear his heart pounding as if it will burst - and 
               gradually Vivian, too, becomes aware of it.

<b>                                     VIVIAN
</b>                         Well? What is it?

               Just for a moment Mark's arm moves. His back hides what he 
               is doing. Suddenly WE SEE Vivian turn her head sharply - 
               she is looking at something out of camera.

<b>                                     VIVIAN
</b>                              (in a whisper)
                         That...?

               The spike is very close to her throat - but Vivian ignores 
               it, staring out of camera.

               Over Mark's shoulder we concentrate on Vivian's face.

<b>                                     VIVIAN
</b>                              (in a whisper)
                         Mark... take it...

               The fear on her face is rapidly growing...

<b>                                     VIVIAN
</b>                         ... away!

               She tries to move back - but the trunk prevents her.

<b>                                     VIVIAN
</b><b>                         MARK - YOU!
</b>
               It is almost a scream.

               We can hear Mark breathing quickly. 

               Vivian raises her hands to push something away from her.  

               Suddenly the screen is filled with her eyes. WE SEE them 
               dilating with terror. There is a sudden crash as the big 
               power switches go out in the roof.

               The lights go out.

               There is a scream in the darkness.

               Then silence.

               The darkness acquires a grey, opaque quality as if one is 
               seeing the world through a curtain - it is the world of 
               Mrs. Stephens.  

               A bright light is felt, rather than seen, beating against 
               our eyelids. It looms closer and stronger.

<b>                                     HELEN'S VOICE (O.S.)

               From Helen's POV WE SEE her reach for her glass with a 
               steady hand.

               Helen spins the coin on the table Mrs. Stephens listens 
               intently... the coin stops spinning.

               Her fingers shoot out and feel the surface of the coin.

               She turns the coin over and carefully feels the other side. 
               Helen watches her with a smile - then looks thoughtfully 
               at the ceiling.

               Helen glances at her watch... then looks curiously round 
               the room.

               CLOSE SHOT of Vivian's recorder, placed on a chair.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen. She picks it up and looks at it, 
               curiously, fingering the stops.

               Helen turns round. Mark is standing on the threshold of 
               the dark-room.

<b>                                     HELEN

               He walks towards her... he stops suddenly. He is staring 
               at the recorder in her hand.

<b>                                     HELEN

</b>                         Yes.

               Gently he takes it from her - as if it is a cup with which 
               she has finished - and replaces it on the shelf.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen.

               Her voice trails away.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is holding out a small package.

               He watches her hold it against her dress.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark touching his lapel. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen glancing at her watch.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark glancing at his. He thinks of the ticking 
               clock in the dark-room.  

               Helen looks up, and sees him.

               He looks as if he has just been voted the best cameraman 
               of the year (unanimously) - and the two films he directed 
               have both won Oscars (though Don Jarvis understood them).  

               His delighted astonishment is such that she has to smile.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY - and WE SEE whom he is addressing. 
               It is Diane.

               CAMERA PULLS FURTHER BACK and WE SEE that we are in a small 
               theatre watching rushes...

               CAMERA PANS across Baden's disgruntled face... the Chief 
               Cameraman's bored face... the Script Girl's puzzled face... 
               to Diane's expression of rapture as she watches herself on 
               the screen.

</b>                         I'd like to see that one.

               From Diane's POV WE WATCH the screen. We see the Tall Man 
               (SHOP ASSISTANT) reaching for a trunk and laying it on the 
               counter. He opens it with a flourish. Vivian passes across 
               the screen - glances casually at the trunk - and wanders 
               off.

               The Assistant Director nods.

               CAMERA LINGERS for a moment on the screen as Diane (on-
               screen) smiles at the Assistant.

                         I'll take it.

               The Assistant bows and closes the trunk. We dissolve to

               The Assistant is leaning over the counter, listening 
               intently. Diane stands in front of the counter, receiving 
               the attentions of the Make-up Man.  

               Baden's voice is overlaid:

               (and its crew) are off camera, and we concentrate on Baden 
               briefing his artistes.  

               He is clutching a script as if afraid that opening it might 
               be indecent exposure.

               From Mark's POV WE WATCH the scene being rehearsed. Diane 
               approaches the trunk counter and the Assistant smiles at 
               her.

               She pockets another item.  He turns and wrestles with 
               another trunk... brings it forward and opens it

               Mark walks away quietly from the back of the Camera Crew. 
               He hurries to the shelf where he keeps his cine-camera and 
               a lunch basket. He reaches for his camera.  

               Diane's voice is overlaid.

               Mark turns towards the rehearsal and raises his cine-camera. 
               WE SEE the Assistant try to lift a blue trunk - and half 
               collapse with the weight of it.

               CLOSE SHOT of Baden - beaming.

               The Assistant manages to drag the trunk forward. He leans 
               over it - exhausted - then starts to open it.

               Mark moves round until Diane's face is in the finder.

               As the lid of the trunk is opened we can see only her eyes 
               above the rim of the lid... WE HEAR her scream.

               CLOSE SHOT of Baden - freezing.  

               There is the sound of a body falling to the ground.

               They have formed themselves into small groups and are 
               talking in whispers.  The Assistant Director is standing

               Mark glances out of the window.

               From his POV WE SEE a police car driving across the 
               courtyard. Mark watches with great interest - then reaches 
               for his cine-camera.

               He photographs the police, then puts his cine-camera on to 
               the table and sits back... waiting. CAMERA LINGERS for a 
               moment on the folded tripod.

<b>               INT. SET - DAY
</b>
               The set is completely deserted. It is lit by a single lamp. 
               A solitary trunk stands on the counter, its lid closed.  

               WE SEE Don Jarvis enter, followed by the two Policemen. 
               Baden and the Publicity man bring up the rear.

               Don Jarvis points towards the trunks department. The Chief 
               Inspector nods, then he and the Sergeant approach the 
               counter.

               Carefully the Inspector raises the lid of the trunk - he 
               looks inside.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector - over the top of the lid. His 
               expression is mainly one of surprise.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Sergeant staring into the trunk. He is 
               also surprised - but there is nausea in his face.  

               They look up at almost the same moment... their eyes meet.

</b>
               He is looking out of the window - his camera at the ready.  
               Overlaid is the sound of a door opening... the buzz of 
               conversation dies away. We hear Don Jarvis' voice.

               A hand tugs at Mark's elbow. He turns round. The Clapper 
               Boy looks at him waringly.

               From Mark's POV WE SEE Don Jarvis standing in the doorway -
               facing a suddenly hushed room. The great man's hands are 
               folded in front of him -

               the window falls upon Mark, listening to him with rapt 
               attention. Mark's hands are folded in front of him.

               He walks slowly towards the door.

               The Clapper Boy takes out a copy of Sight and Sound and 
               starts to read it.

<b>               INT. SMALL OFFICE - DAY

               The Inspector is seated at a desk, reading some notes. The 
               Sergeant is seated by the side of the desk, a pile of papers 
               in front of him.

               There is a gentle knock on the door. The Sergeant glances 
               at a list.

                         Whatever that may be?

               The Inspector nods.

               He puts a tick on the list. There is the sound of a door 
               opening. The Inspector looks up...

               From his POV WE SEE a young man with a camera over his 
               shoulder advancing shyly towards him.

               at the Inspector.

               The telephone rings.  The Sergeant promptly answers it.

               From the Sergeant's POV WE SEE Mark turn to go into the 
               passage.

               The Sergeant stares at the camera on his shoulder... then 
               the door closes.

               The Sergeant makes a note on a piece of paper.

<b>               INT. PASSAGE - DAY

               The Inspector and Mark walk side by side along the passage. 
               The Clapper Boy comes into view - still reading Sight and 
               Sound.

               The Clapper Boy glances up - just in time to see the 
               Inspector and Mark walk side by side to the end of the 
               corridor.

<b>               INT. ENTRANCE TO SET - DAY

               A Constable is standing outside the entrance to the set.  
               From his POV WE SEE the Inspector and Mark approach.  The 
               Constable stiffens...  From Mark's POV WE SEE the Constable 
               barring the entrance.

<b>                                     INSPECTOR

</b>                         ...thanks for the escort

               The Inspector hurries towards the door of the set. 

               The Constable opens it - and the Inspector goes inside. 

               The Constable closes the door - and stands in front of it. 

               Mark turns away quickly.

</b>
<b>               EXT. COURTYARD - DAY
</b>
               The carpark is jammed with cars - but there is hardly anyone 
               in sight. Mark hurries towards the large sliding doors of 
               Stage E - they are a few feet apart. He looks round 
               carefully, then slips inside.

<b>               INT. STAGE E. - DAY
</b>
               Facing Mark is the darkened set of an hotel bedroom. Beyond 
               this is another set - also in darkness - and beyond this 
               yet another. Only in the far comer of the studio - in the 
               furthermost set - is there a light burning. Voices can 
               faintly be heard coming from this set. 

               Mark walks quietly towards a long ladder which leads up to 
               the gantry. Carefully - rung by rung - he starts to climb 
               the ladder. At the top of the ladder is a gallery. Mark 
               moves along the maze of bridges until he is nearly above 
               the Policemen.

               Mark raises his head cautiously - and looks down.

               Far below WE CAN SEE the Inspector standing next to the 
               Doctor - a tall, silver haired man - who is peering into 
               an open trunk. Detectives are photographing the set. Mark 
               raises his cine-camera... its gentle purring seems to echo 
               round the studio.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's jacket pocket. A row of pencils is 
               sticking out. As he leans forward the pencils tilt. 

               Through the finder-matte of Mark's camera WE SEE the 
               Inspector - very far away - peering into the trunk and 
               nodding.

               A faint echo of conversation is overlaid.

<b>                                     DOCTOR (O.S.)
</b>                         No doubt at all... wounds were 
                         caused by the same instrument...

               Mark changes lens (and alters the finder to a 75mm lens). 
               The Doctor's face - thin and impersonal - appears in the 
               finder over the lid of the trunk.

                         most violent shock...

</b>                         What sort of shock?

</b>                         ...still cannot determine - but 
                         look!

               He points to something in the trunk - out of the camera's 
               eye-line.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

               He balances carefully - then raises the camera above his 
               head. As he leans forward, the pencils fall. WE SEE them 
               shooting like small torpedoes into the darkness below. 
               They make three separate landings.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Inspector. Looking up.

               From his POV WE SEE tiers of scaffolding deep in shadow...

</b>                         Quiet, everyone.  Please...

               The Detectives make as much noise to become quiet as the 
               normal occupants of the studio - and then there is complete 
               silence.

               Complete, except for the Doctor's asthmatic breathing... 
               And then - so gently that it might almost be in our own 
               minds - WE HEAR a purring sound from the shadows above. 
               The Inspector listens intently.

               There is a burst of laughter - the Inspector frowns.

                         our hands, and if we don't get him 
                         quickly there'll be a third unsolved 
                         murder to report to the 
                         Commissioner. So let's hurry things 
                         up, shall we?

</b>                         Sorry, Chief!

               The 'putty cat' Detective raises his flashlamp towards the 
               trunk counter. In the brilliant flash of light that ensues, 
               we glimpse a shadowy figure moving towards a ladder high

               Mrs. Stephens is doing her knitting. The inevitable glass 
               stands on the table beside her. Helen is seated opposite, 
               reading from a newspaper.

                         showed such promise, that her role

               She crosses to a cupboard and unlocks it, then turns round. 
               He is standing hesitantly on the threshold.

               He looks slowly round the room, stares for a moment at the 
               bed in the comer, but he won't cross the threshold. He 
               stays outside.

               Suddenly Mark stands motionless. He is staring at something 
               off camera.

               Especially when -

               Her voice trails away... she is staring at Mark staring at 
               something.

               In the shadows, at the mouth of an alley, a young couple 
               are kissing.

               Mark stands motionless, staring at them. Automatically his 
               hand reaches for his camera. Helen starts to speak - then 
               looks at him in silence. The man glances round. Mark hurries 
               away and Helen stares after him.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark.

               He turns back - waiting for Helen.

               From his POV WE SEE Helen come slowly towards him. She 
               looks at him searchingly for a long moment.

               He manages - but only just - to meet her eyes.

               A moment's pause. She drinks her wine - shy, awaiting his 
               reaction.

</b>                         ... I looked out of my window - 
                         and saw you going off to work 
                         carrying that camera like a little 
                         boy with a satchel... and an idea 
                         came... so thank you...

               He slams the table so violently that a lady nearby looks 
               around... then reaches for his camera.

</b>                         There isn't a single face that 
                         doesn't look like a child's - not 
                         a single one - if you catch it at 
                         the right moment.

               He turns around excitedly and sees her watching him.

</b>                         It would be a challenge!... Unlike

                         children to see.

               She looks at him curiously.

</b>                         But this would belong to them -

                         right... Oh, Helen... I would like 
                         to find those faces for you...

               He laughs excitedly... She looks regretfully at her watch. 
               At once he looks at his.

</b>                         Thank you...

               He signals to the head waiter... and pays his first bill 
               for two.

               They walk along the street very close together, but not 
               quite touching. Above them a light is shining on a blind 
               revealing a shadow of a woman undressing.

               Mark glances at the blind - then looks away quickly.

               He stares ahead of him... and continues to stare ahead of 
               him.

               Suddenly Helen tucks her arm through his, and smiles up at 
               him... they walk on in silence.

<b>               INT. HALL OF MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               Helen and Mark come in quietly, and close the door.

               She glances round the dimly lit hall. There is no light 
               under any of the doors, except one at the end of the 
               passage.

                         And you made it wonderful... without 
                         your camera.

               A shadow passes over his face.

               He stands motionless as she goes into her room... 

               From his POV WE SEE the half-opened door - and the bed in 
               the comer.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark forcing himself to look away.

               Helen reappears on the threshold - the camera in her hand. 
               He looks down at it - then slowly stretches out his hand.

               The door at the end of the passage opens and Tony emerges 
               in his dressing-gown, carrying a towel. He avoids looking 
               at them - goes into the bathroom opposite, and slams the 
               door.

               There is the sound of running water.

                         then I'll go to bed... and think 
                         of how to find faces for you...

               He looks down at the face which he has found for himself. 
               She raises her head slowly.

</b>                         ...faces which - are faces which...

               She kisses him very gently on the mouth. The bathroom begins 
               to sound like a small waterfall.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Good night, Mark...

               He watches her as she goes into the room, and doses the 
               door. A light goes on beneath the door.

               He stands very still for a moment... then turns the camera 
               round and points the lens towards his lips.

               Then he turns abruptly, and hurries up the stairs.

               The waterfall cascades on.  The screen grows dark - and 
               the dark-room grows out of it.

<b>               INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               The big drying drum is turning, feeding the dry print into 
               a box. A small motor drives it.  CLOSE SHOT of the box. 
               Mark is spooling up the film as it comes off the drier. 
               Once or twice he can't help glancing at an image.

               CLOSE UP of Vivian's face, in the image.

               Mark stops the motor and the drum, loosens the end of the 
               film, spools up with a snap, slides the spool off and 
               hurries out with it.

               Mark hurries to his projector, threads the film and starts 
               the projector. He flicks it on, as if it were a gramophone, 
               then looks eagerly at the 16mm screen.  

               Behind him something moves in the shadows 

               REVERSE SHOT of Mark.  

               Over the shoulder of someone who is standing deep in the 
               shadows WE SEE Mark. His head obscures what he is watching 
               on the screen.

<b>               HE TURNS ROUND SUDDENLY -
</b>
               From Mark's POV WE SEE the processing sinks deep in shadow. 
               He starts to move towards them, then suddenly stares at 
               the shadows at the back of the room.

               Silence - except for the whirring of the 16mm projector.  

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark's hand - switching on the light.  Mark 
               turns round... he is as astonished at what he sees as he 
               can be.

               CAMERA PANS in its own good time to the back of the room.  

               Mrs. Stephens is standing in the shadows... a heavy hand 
               rests on a heavy stick... the sightless eyes stare 
               unerringly towards the light switch.

                         the rest of the adventure alone...

               He stands motionless, staring at her standing motionless. 
               Above her head an ancient, half-blind camera also stares 
               at her. The only movement in the room is her smile.

               Mrs. Stephens nods. Her hand touches the black cloth loading 
               bag, lying on the table.

                         so do I.

               CLOSE SHOT of her hand - touching the black cloth bag. 

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - walking slowly towards her. 

               At once she raises the heavy stick - pointing it towards 
               him.  

               CLOSE SHOT of the stick. It is a shooting stick - with a 
               sharp spike on the end of it, similar to the tripod on 
               Mark's camera.

               Mark stares at the stick, fascinated.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens - exploring the inside of the 
               black cloth bag with her free hand.

</b>                         It's a changing bag... we put films 
                         in it - so that the light won't 
                         spoil them...

                         anything...

               The screen greys out.

               In Mrs. Stephens' own dark-room we hear the hum of Mark's 
               projector - and the pounding of Mark's heart - and, very 
               faintly, the sounds of Tony bathing himself.

                         wait to look at?

               The sound of his footsteps softly approaching.  Like a

               Very faintly we hear Tony singing in his bath.  

<b>               FADE IN:

               The singing dies away, and the sound returns to normal.  

               Over Mark's shoulder WE SEE Mrs. Stephens holding her stick 
               in front of her.

               Mrs. Stephens smiles - then turns her head towards the 
               16mm screen.

               He takes her arm gently and guides her towards us.

               Both of them stare at the 16mm screen... She leans forward - 
               her face only inches from the screen - the light from the 
               projector flickering on to her.  

               REVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. Slowly she stretches 
               out her hands and touches the screen.

               Her head and shoulders blot out most of the screen - but 
               between her outspread fingers WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of a girl's 
               terrified eyes.

               He hurries to his cine-camera.

</b>                         I've yet to meet an artist who

               Mark slips a new spool of film into his cine-camera.

                         another.

               He looks at her thoughtfully, then presses a light switch. 
               A spotlight falls blindingly on to her eyes. He presses 
               another switch, and then another, until the whole of her 
               face is shining with light.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS

                         on my face?

               He walks towards her. She starts to back away.

               The shadow of Mark's head appears on the 16mm screen. WE 
               SEE him raise his camera - then pull down the tripod.  

               Black out into the grey darkness of Mrs. Stephens' world.  

               WE HEAR the purring of Mark's camera - more clearly than 
               we have yet heard it. (There is the faint rasp of a cog 
               which needs oiling.) The sound of footsteps approaching... 
               the purring changes direction.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS (O.S.)

</b>                         It's almost over...

               The purring is on top of her. There is a sudden thud.

<b>               FADE IN: 
</b>
               Mrs. Stephens is leaning against the wall... she has dropped 
               her heavy stick. It lies on the floor a few feet away from 
               her. Mark is kneeling in front of her - the tripod firmly 
               on the floor. The cine-camera is pointing upwards into her 
               face. He peers excitedly into the viewfinder.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Please let me finish! It's for 
                         Helen!

               She edges towards her stick. He hurries forward and picks 
               it up. He looks at the spike on the end of it - then 
               carefully gives it to her by the handle. She grasps it 
               tightly.

                         photographed!

                 He returns excitedly to his camera.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS
</b>                         My daughter sees enough of my face 
                         without photographs...

               On Mark's focusing screen WE SEE the fear on her face. Her 
               hand trembles as she wipes away the perspiration.

<b>                                     MARK (O.S.)

</b>                         Not frightened! Hot!

               But it is fear that we are looking at.

<b>                                     MRS. STEPHENS
</b>                         So put that camera away...

               On the focusing screen we see her moisten her lips 
               nervously.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Yes!

               He switches off the camera abruptly, and folds up the 
               tripod. He turns away without looking at her - and hurries 
               to the door.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens listening to his movements - 
               puzzled.

               He glances towards her.

               From his POV WE SEE the fear in her eyes. He looks away at 
               once, staring into the darkened room.

               From her POV (shooting over her shoulder with a large CLOSE 
               SHOT of her ear in the foreground) WE SEE Mark standing in 
               the doorway - and hear, very clearly, his quick, uneasy 
               breathing.

               We hear his quick intake of breath.

               The tapping of her stick is overlaid. Mark hurries to the 
               door and opens it - staring into the dimly lit passage. 
               Over his shoulder WE SEE her tapping her way towards him 
               from the dark-room.

               The (studio) camera is ready for a tracking shot. The set 
               is redressed as the Hat Department of the store. The 
               Inspector stands on the dolly, looking round with interest.  

               The Doctor is sitting in a chair watching everything like 
               an excited schoolboy. The Sergeant has positioned himself 
               near the sound crew.  

               Baden walks on to the set, his arm round Diane's shoulder. 
               He is talking to her softly. She keeps her eyes on the 
               floor; he leads her to the front of the studio camera.

               He pats her arm reassuringly. The Chief Cameraman nods to 
               Mark.

               From the Inspector's POV WE SEE Mark pull a tape measure 
               from the front of the camera and hold it to Diane's 
               forehead. From Mark's POV WE SEE the Inspector watching 
               him over the top of the studio camera. A man with a shock 
               of white hair is also watching him... and the Sergeant 
               stares at him from the other side of the set. The tape 
               measure in Mark's hand remains steady.

               From the Inspector's POV WE SEE Mark replace the tape 
               measure and take up his position on a small stool by the 
               side of the camera.

                         him. He lectured to me.

               He looks at Mark with renewed interest. So does the 
               Inspector.

               From his POV WE SEE Mark and the Doctor talking. The Doctor 
               is fidgeting with his watch chain. Mark fidgets with his 
               jacket button. The Inspector then glances towards the Hat 
               Salesman, who is holding court in the comer. We return to 
               Mark and the Doctor.

               Mark puts his hands behind his back.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - his last hope gone.

               From the Sergeant's POV WE SEE the Doctor hand Mark a card, 
               and pat him jovially on the shoulder. The Sergeant edges 
               up to the Inspector.

               Overlaid is the noise of the unit dispersing. Mark picks 
               up his camera - then reaches for the lunch basket. An urgent

               He turns round. The Clapper Boy is standing there. The

               He winks at Mark, gives him the postcard.

               comes out with a manuscript in a parcel under her arm.

<b>               EXT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

               Mark watches her. Beyond him stands an insignificant-looking 
               man in a raincoat.

               Helen looks at her watch.

               Helen hurries homeward.

               Mark slowly turns his back and walks away, gradually 
               gathering speed. The man in the raincoat follows him.

               Mark hurries towards the shop... ahead of him a street 
               clock stands at just on six. Mark unslings his cine-camera 
               and photographs this clock... then he hurries into the 
               shop.

               The man in the raincoat walks into camera. He looks at the 
               clock, puzzled, then glances at the newsagent's window. He 
               gazes with interest at Mark's photograph of Milly, then 
               walks thoughtfully down the street.  

               All the clocks in the kingdom chime the hour of six.

               Mark takes the key. He starts to smile.

               the curtains of a window above the newsagent's shop go 
               out. CAMERA TRACKS TOWARDS the door of the shop. Mark comes 
               out, his cine-camera over his shoulder. He has a key in 
               his hand. He closes the door of the shop... then looks at 
               the key. He fits it into the lock - then slips it through 
               the letter-box. He turns and hails a taxi.

               CLOSE SHOT of the Detective. He looks at the shop, 
               hesitates, decides to follow Mark - hails another cab.

               Helen is leaning over the bed. She has her coat on.

               She shakes her mother's shoulders. Mrs. Stephens snores 
               on.

               She shakes her again — but it is hopeless. Helen pulls the 
               bedclothes round her mother, then turns away. She picks up 
               a large envelope and her handbag, and hurries to the door.

               then something starts to happen to the comers of her 
               mouth... and then her eyes become locked... and cannot 
               stop watching. Some kind of sound comes from the back of 
               her throat. Her hands dig into the table and she tries to 
               stand up. She cannot manage it the first time - and keeps 
               on watching, then, like a child waking from a nightmare,

               She stands with her back to him. From REVERSE ANGLE we see

               staring at the 16mm screen.

               The sound of him switching it off.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen — not enough breath to scream... hardly 
               enough to breathe.

               From her POV WE SEE him standing in front of the door, 
               looking ahead of him. She backs slowly away into the shadows 
               at the back of the room.

                         not all.

               The room is suddenly filled with the terrified screaming 
               of a small boy. Helen wheels round. The screaming seems to 
               be coming from the walls. Mark's hand is on a switch - one 
               of a number on a panel.

               He presses another switch. There is a click, and the 
               screaming stops, to be replaced by a low sobbing.

                         Turn it off!

               He does so - at once. She walks towards him. He turns away 
               from her.

               He turns to his cine-camera, and picks it up. He releases 
               the tripod.

               CAMERA HOLDS on Helen. She stands very still against the 
               wall. Mark's voice is overlaid.

<b>                                     MARK (O.S.)

                         frightening thing in the world 
                         is?...

               She is looking at something, puzzled.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         It's fear.

               The sound of his footsteps approaching...

</b>                         So I did something... very simple...

               WE SEE a look of fear spring into her eyes.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Very simple.

               WE SEE the spike approaching her throat... but she is 
               looking at something else.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         When they felt the spike... touching 
                         their throats... and knew I was 
                         going to kill them...

               The spike is touching her throat.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         ... I made them - watch their own 
                         deaths!

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen's face several times its natural size. 
               She is looking at herself in a large circular magnifying 
               mirror which has been fitted over the camera's face. The 
               mirror entirely obscures both Mark and the camera. There 
               is a small hole in the mirror through which the lens of 
               the camera winks. As Helen looks at her terrified distorted 
               face this small hole gives her an extra eye in the middle 
               of her forehead.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Made them see their own terror as 
                         the spike went in... and if death 
                         has a face, they saw that too!

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark - crouching behind the mirror, sweat 
               pouring down his forehead... his finger on the trigger of 
               the camera.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Not you! Not you! I'll never 
                         photograph you! I promised - I 
                         promised - Not you!  

               Helen's eyes are closed. The spike is still touching her 
               throat.

               CLOSE SHOT of Mark — his face turned away from the 
               viewfinder.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         ... frightened ... for you...

               There's the sound of a car pulling up. He hurries to the 
               other room.

<b>               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               The Police arrive: three cars.  Mark appears at an upstairs 
               window with his camera.

<b>                                     SERGEANT
</b>                         Look out!

               He thinks Mark has a gun. They all duck. Mark raises his 
               camera and photographs them. The Police recover and charge 
               for the house. Mark disappears.

<b>               INT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Mark hurries back into the room carrying his camera. He 
               knows exactly what he has to do.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Mark! Mark! Give yourself up!

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         I've been ready for this... for 
                         such a long time...

               Rapidly he fixes his camera on to a hook on the wall. Then 
               he adjusts the tripod so that the spikes protrude towards 
               him...

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         What are you...

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         It'll be all right.

               He makes chalk marks on the floor in front of the camera, 
               then switches on all the floodlights. WE CAN HEAR the 
               Policemen pounding on the door.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         I can beat that!

               He crosses to a switch - presses it.  The room is filled 
               with a small boy's screaming.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         Give yourself up... Mark!

               He stands next to her, and looks at his long array of 
               cameras. WE SEE that each one of them has been fitted with 
               a small metal disc (a delayed release), and that some of 
               the older cameras have flashlights attached.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Watch them, Helen... Watch them 
                         say goodbye - one by one -
                              (he presses a master 
                              switch on the wait)
                         I've timed this... so often...

               Slowly he walks past his cameras. As he does, the metallic 
               disc on each one explodes with a little plop - and the eye 
               of each camera winks once as if in salute. Some go off 
               with flashlights on either side of the room. The sound of 
               footsteps hurrying up the stairs.

               Ahead of Mark - coming steadily closer — are the spikes of 
               the tripod. The mirror on the cine-camera reflects the 
               approach - and Helen's terrified face.

<b>                                     HELEN
</b>                         No - No!

               The child's screaming reaches its peak as Mark approaches 
               the spikes... Ahead of him, on the small table where his 
               projector stands, is Helen's book The Magic Camera.

<b>                                     MARK

                         faces for you... 

               The Policemen are now rattling on the dark-room door. 

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         Helen - I'm afraid!

               We see his face, terrified, in the magnifying mirror. The 
               spikes are against his throat. The eye of the camera is 
               winking rapidly.

<b>                                     MARK
</b>                         I'm glad I'm afraid!

               Heavy shoulders are pressing against the dark-room door... 
               as it breaks in, Mark lunges forward against the spikes. 
               The cine-camera is wrenched away from the wall as he falls 
               back. He crashes against the small table, which falls over. 
               He is not parted from his camera - it is fixed to him by 
               the tripod, and falls back with him, covering his face 
               like a canopy. WE SEE his face in the lens of the cine-
               camera. and WE SEE his hand - lying limp on the cover of 
               The Magic Camera.

               The Policemen hurry into the room. They stare motionless 
               at what they see.

               CLOSE SHOT of Helen - her face buried in her hands.

               The child's screaming stops suddenly... and in the absolute 
               silence which follows WE HEAR the voice of Mark's father:

<b>                                     FATHER'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                         Don't be a silly boy... there's 
                         nothing to be afraid of...

               And a small voice answers.

<b>                                     CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                         Good night, Daddy...

               The spotlights begin to dim... The dazzling white of the 
               16mm screen fades slowly into greyness...

               The room is filled with the gentle breathing of a small 
               child.

<b>                                                               FADE OUT:

<b>               THE END
