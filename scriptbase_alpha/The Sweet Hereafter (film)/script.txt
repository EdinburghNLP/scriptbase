     FADE IN

     INT. SUMMER COTTAGE -- DAY

     A young family together in bed.  It is a bright summer
     morning.  Father, mother, and a three year old girl are
     still asleep.  They are naked.  A light breeze drifts into
     the room.  The scene is serene and softly suspended.

     Head credits appear over this idyllic image.  The little
     girl turns in her sleep.  A dog barks outside.

     INT./EXT.  CAR WASH. -- NIGHT

     From the peaceful tableau of the sleeping family, the scene
     shifts to a vehicle entering a car wash.  The image is shot
     through the windshield, from the driver's point of view.

     The car enters the lathered world of spinning felt wheels
     and gushing water.

     INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT

     Inside the car MITCHELL STEPHENS, a man in his mid-fifties,
     listens to a stirring piece of music.  The sound of the car
     wash is filtered out by the strains of music.

     EXT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

     The phone booth is located in a rundown area of a large
     city.  A young woman, ZOE, enters the booth and lifts the
     receiver.

     INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT

     MITCHELL STEPHENS is going through the wash.  The automatic
     mops and buffers embrace his car with water and suds.  The
     cellular phone in the car rings.  MITCHELL picks it up.

                    MITCHELL
          Yes?  Yes, I'll accept the charges.

     ZOE is on the phone.  There's a figure outside the booth
     waiting for her.

          Daddy, it's me...How are you doing?
          That's great...Where are you?

          wash.  Make sure you've got the
          windows closed.

          Remember that time we were having
          the car washed and I started playing
          with the automatic window?  How old
          was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got
          absolutely soaked, remember?

          you?  What's the matter with wanting

                    (over the phone)
          So what's the problem?

                    MITCHELL
          The problem is I have no idea who
          I'm talking to right now.

                    ZOE
                    (over the phone)
          'Cause you think I'm stoned, Daddy?
          'Cause you think I've got a needle
          stuck in my arm?  Is that what
          you're thinking, Daddy?

                    (over the phone)
          Daddy!  Are you listening to me,
          Daddy?!

     The music that MITCHELL has been listening to becomes louder
     as he stares at the spinning felt wheels of the car wash.

          you're in so I know...how to talk to
          you...how to act...

     The blues number continues as the camera cranes down to the
     bandstand of a country fair.  A local band is rehearsing.

     Around the practising band, various carpenters and
     technicians are making final preparations for that evening's
     big event.

     One of the people watching the band is SAM BURNELL, a man in
     his early forties.  He watches his daughter, NICOLE, as she
     sings into the microphone.  NICOLE is sixteen.

     NICOLE stares at her father as she sings.

     ANGLE ON

     SAM looking back at his daughter.  He is intensely proud of
     her.  SAM is a carpenter, working on at the fair site.  He
     gets back to his work, hammering a supporting beam into the
     grandstand.

     MITCHELL STEPHENS in a crowded airport washroom, watching a
     young father, PETER, trying to change the diaper on his
     three year old daughter.

     MITCHELL stares at the little girl, his face registering a
     wistful smile.  PETER is having a hard time trying to find
     the towel from the toddler's bag and keeping an eye on her
     at the same time.

                    MITCHELL
          Need a hand?

                    PETER
          Sure, it you could find a towel in
          this bag.  I know my wife packed one
          in there...

     MITCHELL comes forward and searches through the toddler's
     bag.

                    MITCHELL
          You always think you're prepared for
          these things.

                    PETER
          Tell me about it.

                    MITCHELL
          How old is she?

                    PETER
          Almost three.

          Here we go.

                    PETER
          Thanks.

     PETER lays the towel across the counter, and dries the
     little girl.  MITCHELL watches as PETER puts a new diaper on
     her.  The toddler stares up at MITCHELL, her eyes are
     playful.

     MITCHELL stares at the girl's face.

                    MITCHELL
          Yes, operator, I'm in a strange
          situation.  I'm calling from my car,

     get out of the car without getting soaked.

     ANGLE ON

     MITCHELL as he leaves the car, trying to protect himself
     from the onslaught of water with his umbrella.  He is
     immediately soaked by a large mop.  The camera watches

     wash.

     MITCHELL walks into the office of the car wash.  No one is
     there.  There is an ominous buzz coming from another room.

     MITCHELL moves towards the garage of the car wash/auto
     repair establishment.  He moves into a larger room, full of
     discarded auto parts.  The buzzing noise is coming from an
     electric guitar, which has been left on, and is on the verge
     of screeching feedback.

     Someone was just here.  They are nowhere to be seen.

                    MITCHELL
          Hello?

     No response.  MITCHELL picks up the guitar, which begins to

          That was great.

                    NICOLE
          Really?

                    SAM
          You're going to blow everyone away.

                    NICOLE
          You mean it?

                    SAM
          Of course.

                    NICOLE
          You don't sound like one hundred
          percent absolutely sure.

                    SAM
          I am.  Really.  It was awesome.

     NICOLE assesses SAM.  Sensing his sincerity, she throws her
     arms around him in a gesture of unabashed excitement.

     exhausted looking woman in her mid-thirties, once attractive
     but very run-down.  RISA stares at MITCHELL'S soaked
     clothes.

     else.

          night?

                    MITCHELL
          Hard to say.  I might have...some
          business here.

     A voice is heard from the darkness beyond the desk.

          You here about the accident?

     MITCHELL stares at WENDELL'S haunted eyes, then looks back
     at RISA.  He immediately knows their story.

                    MITCHELL
          Yes.  I'm a lawyer.  I realize this
          is an awful time, but it's important

     NICOLE smiles at this scene.  SAM notices, turns around to
     see the children, then turns back to NICOLE.

     MITCHELL STEPHENS is having a meeting with WENDELL and RISA
     WALKER in their livingroom behind the reception area.
     MITCHELL has a pad of paper and is taking notes.

                    WENDELL
          Kyle Lambston's a drunk.  Nobody
          likes him.  He's a nasty piece of
          work.

                    MITCHELL
          In what way?
 






                    WENDELL
          Been drinking since high school.
          Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart
          enough.

                    MITCHELL
          Any criminal record?

                    WENDELL
          Probably half a dozen traffic
          convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost
          his licence.  That's why he don't
          work no more.

                    WENDELL
          Can't get off that shitty dump they
          live on.  What little money comes in
          goes to booze.

                    MITCHELL
          How does the family survive?

                    WENDELL
          Don't know.  Food banks, welfare,
          church charity.  They scrape by.

     MITCHELL looks at RISA, who has remained silent.

                    MITCHELL
          What about Doreen?

                    RISA
          She...she was a friend of mine.

                    MITCHELL
          When?

                    RISA
          At school.  She fell for Kyle just
          before we graduated.  Got pregnant,
          and...went to live in a trailer up
          on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own.
          Kyle started spending more and more
          time at the Spread Eagle...

                    MITCHELL
          That's the local bar?

                    RISA
                    (nodding)
          ...coming home drunk and I guess
          feeling trapped by his life and
          blaming her for that...and...
 






     RISA hesitates.

                    WENDELL
          Taking it out on her.

     MITCHELL stops taking notes, and looks at the WALKERS.

                    MITCHELL
          He beat her?

     RISA nods.  MITCHELL crosses the LAMBSTONS off of his list.
     He looks up at RISA and WENDELL.

                    MITCHELL (CONT'D)
          You see, to do this right, to
          actually have a chance at winning -
          of getting some money to compensate
          you for the loss of your boy - we
          need folks like you.  Sensitive,
          loving parents.  People with no
          criminal background or history of
          trouble in town.  Do you understand?

     The WALKERS nod.

                    MITCHELL (CONT'D)
          Now, of all these parents you've
          told me about whose kids were
          killed, who would you consider to be
          good upstanding neighbors?

     RISA stares hard at MITCHELL.

                    RISA
          What do you mean?

                    MITCHELL
          People who will help our cause.

     Pause.

                    RISA
          Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe
          and Shelly Hamilton.

                    WENDELL
                    (caustically)
          Yeah, right.

     Beat.  MITCHELL looks at WENDELL, waiting for an
     explanation.

                    WENDELL (CONT'D)
 






          I mean, everyone knows Joey steals
          antiques from summer cottages.
          Resells them to dealers in the city.
          He's been doing that for years.

     MITCHELL regards WENDELL with a slight smile of admiration.

                    MITCHELL
          That's great, Wendell.  That's the
          sort of thing I need to know.  So it
          doesn't come back to haunt our case
          later on.

                    RISA
          There's the Prescots...

                    WENDELL
          That sonofabitch owes thousands to
          the bank and half the businesses in
          town.  He's about to lose his house
          and car.

                    RISA
          But Charlene...

                    WENDELL
          Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle
          every other night.  Sleeps with
          whatever she can get her hands on.
          She'll go down for a pat on the head
          and a fistful of peanuts.

     MITCHELL is taking notes.

                    WENDELL (CONT'D)
          Don't even think of the Bilodeaus or
          the Atwaters.  They're all inbred.

                    RISA
          The Ottos.

     Pause.  MITCHELL waits.  No response from WENDELL.

                    MITCHELL
          Tell me about the Ottos.

                    RISA
          Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear.
          He was their adopted son.  A
          beautiful boy.  Indian.

                    MITCHELL
          Indian?
 






                    RISA
          Yes.

                    MITCHELL
          That's good.  Judges like adopted
          Indian boys.  Tell me more about the
          Ottos.

     As RISA talks, MITCHELL takes notes.

                    RISA
          They're smart.  Been to college.
          They moved here from the city about
          a dozen years ago.

                    MITCHELL
          What do they do?

                    RISA
          Crafts.

                    MITCHELL
          Crafts?

                    RISA
          Wanda does these photographic
          things.  That's one of her pictures
          on the wall.

                    WENDELL
          Yeah, well, they probably smoke
          weed.

                    RISA
          You don't know that.

                    MITCHELL
          Have they ever been busted?

                    RISA
          No.

                    WENDELL
          You don't know is what you mean.

     MITCHELL regards the tension between RISA and WENDELL as he
     continues to make notes.

     MITCHELL'S cell phone rings.  He answers it.

                    MITCHELL
          Yes, I'll accept the charges.

     MITCHELL stands up.
 







                    MITCHELL (CONT'D)
          Do you mind if I step outside for a
          moment?  It's a private call.

     This scene takes place two years after the accident.

     MITCHELL STEPHENS is playing with his headset, which doesn't
     seem to be working.  He summons a STEWARDESS over.

                    MITCHELL
          I'm not getting any sound.

     The STEWARDESS checks the headset and confirms the problem.

                    STEWARDESS
          I'll find you another pair.

     The STEWARDESS leaves.

     A young woman seated beside MITCHELL hands him her headset.

                    ALISON
          You can have mine.

     MITCHELL takes ALISON'S headset.  Their eyes lock for a
     moment.

                    ALISON (CONT'D)
          Yes, we do know each other.  I'm
          Alison Jones.

                    MITCHELL
          Alison Jones.

                    ALISON
 






          I was a friend of Zoe's.  We went to
          school together.  I used to come to
          your house.

                    MITCHELL
                    (pretending to
                    remember)
          Yes.

                    ALISON
          Ally.  That was my nickname.

                    MITCHELL
          Ally.  That's right.

                    ALISON
          How are you?

                    MITCHELL
          I'm just fine, Ally.  What about
          you?

                    ALISON
          I'm fine.  Still working with my
          father.

                    MITCHELL
          And what does he do again?

                    ALISON
          He used to work with you.  Until you
          found out he was having an affair
          with your wife.

     Pause.  MITCHELL finally remembers ALISON JONES.

                    MITCHELL
          Ally Jones.

                    ALISON
          How is Mrs. Stephens?

                    MITCHELL
          We're...not together.

                    ALISON
          I'd heard that.  But she's well?

                    MITCHELL
          Yes...fine.

                    ALISON
          And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
 






     Pause.  The STEWARDESS comes back with a new headset.  She
     notices the set that ALISON has given him.

                    STEWARDESS
          Oh, you've beaten me to it.

     WANDA and HARTLEY OTTO are waiting for the school bus with
     their adopted son BEAR.

     The bus arrives, and the door opens to reveal DOLORES
     DRISCOLL, who is driving.

                    DOLORES
          Good morning, Wanda.  Hi, Hartley.

                    WANDA
          Hi, Dolores.

     DOLORES watches as WANDA and HARTLEY OTTO affectionately say
     goodbye to their boy.  WANDA gives BEAR a photograph, which
     has strong psychedelic influences.  BEAR shows it proudly to
     DOLORES.

                    WANDA (CONT'D)
          What do you think?

                    DOLORES
          Well, it's certainly what you'd call
          interesting.

                    WANDA
                    (laughing)
          You hate it.

                    DOLORES
          I didn't say that.

                    WANDA
          I could wrap it up.  Protect the
          other kids.

                    DOLORES
          I'll just strap it on the roof.
 







                    WANDA
          It's for the school bazaar.

                    DOLORES
          Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon
          Bear.  Let's get you out of here.

                    WANDA
          Away from your crazy Mom.

                    DOLORES
                    (voice over)
          The Ottos always waited for the bus
          with Bear.  They were the only
          parents who did that, together like
          that.  I guess they're what you
          might call hippies.

                    MITCHELL
                    (voice over)
          What do you mean by that, Mrs.
          Driscoll?

     INT. DOLORES'S HOUSE -- DAY

     DOLORES and MITCHELL are in the modest livingroom of
     DOLORES'S house.  The conversation continues from the
     previous voice over.

     In the corner of the room sits ABBOTT, DOLORES'S husband.
     ABBOTT has suffered a massive stroke, and seems to be
     completely paralyzed.  His presence, however, is intense and
     powerful.

     MITCHELL frequently looks over to ABBOTT during his
     conversations with DOLORES.  ABBOTT is always watching him
     like a hawk, making MITCHELL uneasy.

                    DOLORES
          Dolores.  No one calls me 'Mrs.
          Driscoll'.

                    MITCHELL
          What do you mean by that, Dolores?

                    DOLORES
          About the Ottos?

                    MITCHELL
          Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
 






                    DOLORES
          I mean, the way they look.  Their
          hair and clothing...

                    MITCHELL
          Do they have any reputation for
          drugs?

                    DOLORES
          No, nothing like that.  The Ottos
          are what I'd call model citizens.
          They're regular at town meetings.
          They give their opinions  in a
          respectful way.  They always help
          out at various fund-raising bazaars
          in town , though they aren't church
          goers.

                    MITCHELL
          And they loved Bear.

                    DOLORES
          Oh yes.  Like I said, they always
          came out together to see him off to
          school.  It's like he was their
          little treasure.  He was such a
          beautiful boy.  That's a picture of
          him on the wall there, behind
          Abbott.

     MITCHELL turns around to find the picture of BEAR.

     It is right behind ABBOTT'S head, so MITCHELL has to divide
     his attention between the cute PHOTOGRAPH of BEAR clutching
     a prize rabbit at last year's county fair, and ABBOTT'S
     glaring eyes.

     ANGLE ON

     The PHOTOGRAPHS of various children with their pets.  Some
     have ribbons.

                    DOLORES (CONT'D)
                    (voice over)
          Those are all from the fair last
          year.  Abbott and me were judges at
          the pet show.

                    MITCHELL
          For rabbits?

                    DOLORES
                    (nodding)
 






          Abbott used to breed them 'til he
          had the stroke.  Bear won first
          prize.  Just look at the smile on
          his face.

                    DOLORES
          He was one of those children that
          bring out the best in people.  He
          would have been a wonderful man.

          around Upper Hat Creek.  He always
          started to do that when he caught up
          to the bus.  He'd wave at his kids,
          Jessica and Mason, who always sat at

          So Billy was driving behind the bus
          at the time of the accident?

     DOLORES nods.  Her expression is distant.

                    DOLORES
          Billy loved to see his kids in the
          bus.  They always sat in the back,
          so they could wave to each other.
          It comforted him.

                    MITCHELL
          From what?

                    DOLORES
                    (confused)
          From what?

                    MITCHELL
          Did he have any particular problems
          that you knew of?  Financial
          pressures...run-ins with the law...

                    DOLORES
          No, nothing like that.  Billy's
          wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few
          years ago.  He took over raising the
          children by himself.  It was obvious
          how much he missed Lydia.

                    MITCHELL
          You talked about it?

                    DOLORES
          No.
                    (beat)
          I saw it on his face.

          Which one?

                    ALISON
          Which one?

                    MITCHELL
          Which clinic?

                    ALISON
          I don't remember the name.  It was
          near a beach.

                    MITCHELL
          Sunnyridge.  That was a long time

          ago.

     Beat.  ALISON proceeds cautiously.
 






                    ALISON
          So there were others?

                    MITCHELL
                    (as he eats)
          Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics,
          half-way houses, treatment centers,
          detox units...

                    ALISON
          Then...when did she get better?

                    MITCHELL
          She didn't.

                    ALISON
          But you said...

                    MITCHELL
          That's where I'm going.  To see her.

                    ALISON
          She's in trouble?

                    MITCHELL
          Yes.
                    (beat)
          Do you find there's something
          strange about this meat?

     ALISON stares at her plate.  MITCHELL summons the
     STEWARDESS.

                    STEWARDESS
          Some more wine?

                    MITCHELL
          I'm afraid this meat is overdone.

                    STEWARDESS
          I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens.
          Would you like to try the fish?

                    MITCHELL
          What is it?

                    STEWARDESS
          Poached salmon.

     MITCHELL considers this.  He is polite, but slightly edgy.

                    MITCHELL
          Do you have a cold plate?
 






                    STEWARDESS
          We do.

                    MITCHELL
          Is there shrimp on it?

                    STEWARDESS
          Yes.

                    MITCHELL
          If you could pick the shrimp off, as
          well as anything that touches the
          shrimp...

                    STEWARDESS
                    (smiling)
          I'm not sure if that will leave much
          on the plate.

                    MITCHELL
          Well, let's see what we get.

     The STEWARDESS leaves with MITCHELL'S food.  MITCHELL gets
     up.

                    MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                    (to ALISON)
          If you could excuse me for a moment.

     ALISON nods.  MITCHELL leaves.  ALISON picks at her meat
     undecidedly.

     INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- DAY

     In the mirror of the tiny washroom of the plane, MITCHELL
     washes some water on his face.  He stares at his reflection
     in the mirror.

     EXT. THE OTTOS HOUSE. -- DAY

     MITCHELL approaches the house of HARTLEY and WANDA OTTO.  He
     gets out of his car and knocks on the door.

     WANDA OTTO answers.  She has been crying.  The two stare at
     each other.

                    MITCHELL
          Mrs. Otto, my name is Mitchell
          Stephens.  The Walkers told me you
          might be willing to talk to me.
 







     Pause.

                    MITCHELL (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry for coming over
          unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto,
          but the Walkers said you would
          understand.  I know it's an awful
          time, but it's important that we
          talk.

                    WANDA
          Who are you?

                    MITCHELL
          I'm a lawyer.

                    WANDA
          You can't come here.

                    MITCHELL
          Please, let me explain.  I'll only
          take a moment of your time.

                    WANDA
          No.

                    MITCHELL
          Please.

     WANDA pauses, stares at MITCHELL, then lets him in.

                                     CUT TO

     INT. THE OTTOS HOUSE. -- DAY

     MITCHELL walks into the OTTO residence.  It is a large two-
     storey space divided into several smaller chambers with
     sheets of brightly colored cloth - tie-dyes and Indian
     madras - that hang from wires.

     On a low brick platform in the centre of the main chamber is
     a large wood-burning stove.  A few feet from the stove,
     sitting on an overstuffed cushion, is HARTLEY OTTO.

     HARTLEY is listening to music on his headphones.  He is very
     stoned.  WANDA moves over, and pulls the headphones off her
     husband's head.

                    WANDA
          We have a guest.  What did you say
          your name was?

                    MITCHELL
 






          Mitchell Stephens.

     MITCHELL hands them a card.  HARTLEY reads it with
     deliberation.

                    WANDA
          The Walkers sent him by.

     HARTLEY rises up.  He stares at MITCHELL.  A tense pause.

                    HARTLEY
          You want a cup of tea or something?

                    MITCHELL
          A cup of tea would be nice.
                    (beat)
          Would it be alright if I sit down
          for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I
          want to talk to you.

     WANDA stares at MITCHELL.  No response.  MITCHELL waits a
     beat, then seats himself rather uncomfortably on a large
     pillow.  He is unsure whether to cross his legs, or fold
     them under his chin.

                    MITCHELL (CONT'D)
          The Walkers spoke very highly of
          you.

                    WANDA
          You've been retained?

                    MITCHELL
          Yes.

                    WANDA
          Their child died, and they got a
          lawyer.

     Pause.  MITCHELL assesses WANDA'S energy.

                    MITCHELL
          It should be said that my task is to
          represent the Walkers only in their
          anger.  Not their grief.

                    WANDA
          Who did they get for that?

                    MITCHELL
          You are angry, aren't you, Mrs.
          Otto?  That's why I'm here.  To give
          your anger a voice.  To be your
 






          weapon against whoever caused that
          bus to go off the road.

                    WANDA
          Dolores?

                    MITCHELL
          It's my belief that Dolores was
          doing exactly what she'd been doing
          for years.  Besides, the school
          board's insurance on Dolores is
          minimal.  A few million at the very
          most.  The really deep pockets are
          to be found in the town, or in the
          company that made the bus.

                    WANDA
          You think someone else caused the
          accident?

                    MITCHELL
          Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing
          as an accident.  The word doesn't
          mean anything to me.  As far as I'm
          concerned, somebody somewhere made a
          decision to cut a corner.  Some
          corrupt agency or corporation
          accounted the cost variance between
          a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar
          out-of-court settlement.  They
          decided to sacrifice a few lives for
          the difference.  That's what's done,
          Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so
          many times before.

     HARTLEY returns with the tea.

                    HARTLEY
          But Dolores said she saw a dog and
          tried to...

                    MITCHELL
          How long has Dolores been driving
          that bus, Mr. Otto?  How many times
          has she steered clear of danger?
          What went wrong that morning?

     MITCHELL takes the cup of tea.

                    MITCHELL (CONT'D)
          Someone calculated ahead of time
          what it would cost to sacrifice
          safety.  It's the darkest, most
          cynical thing to imagine, but it's
 






          absolutely true.  And now, it's up
          to me to make them build that bus
          with an extra bolt, or add an extra
          yard of guard rail.  It's the only
          way we can ensure moral
          responsibility in this society.  By
          what I do.

     Pause.

                    WANDA
          So you're just the thing we need.

                    MITCHELL
          Excuse me?

                    WANDA
          Isn't that what you want us to
          believe?  That we're completely
          defenseless?  That you know what's
          best?

                    MITCHELL
          Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very
          carefully.  I do know what's best.

          As we're sitting here the town or
          the school board or the manufacturer
          of that bus are lining up a battery
          of their own lawyers to negotiate
          with people as grief-stricken as
          yourselves.  And this makes me very,
          very mad.  It's why I came all the
          way up here.  If everyone had done
          their job with integrity your son
          would be alive this morning and
          safely in school.  I promise you
          that I will pursue and reveal who it
          was that did not do their job.

                    MITCHELL
          Who is responsible for this tragedy.
          Then, in your name and the Walkers'
          name and the name of whoever decides
          to join us, I shall sue.  I shall
          sue for negligence until they bleed.

     Pause.

                    WANDA
          I want that person to go to jail.
          For the rest of his life.  I want
          him to die there.  I don't want his
          money.
 







     MITCHELL nods sympathetically.

                    MITCHELL
          It's unlikely that anyone will go to
          prison, Mrs. Otto.  But he or his
          company will pay in other ways.  And
          we must make them pay.  Not for the

          money or to compensate you for the
          loss of your son.  That can't be
          done.  But to protect other innocent
          children.  You see, I'm not just
          here to speak for your anger, but
          for the future as well.
                    (beat)
          What we're talking about is an
          ongoing relationship to time.

     Pause.  HARTLEY looks at MITCHELL'S teacup.

                    HARTLEY
          I didn't ask if you wanted milk.

                    MITCHELL
          No.  A little sugar though.

                    HARTLEY
          We've only got honey.

                    MITCHELL
          I'll...take it straight.

     MITCHELL maintains his eye contact with WANDA.

                    WANDA
          Are you expensive?

                    MITCHELL
          No.

                    MITCHELL
          If you agree to have me represent
          you in this suit, I will require no
          payment until after the case is won,
          when I will require one third of the
          awarded amount.  If there is no
          award made, then my services will
          cost you nothing.  It's a standard
          agreement.

                    WANDA
          Do you have this agreement with you?
 






                    MITCHELL
          It's in my car.

     MITCHELL gets up.

                    MITCHELL (CONT'D)
          I'll just be a minute.  Anyhow, you
          should discuss this all without me
          before you make any decision.

     MITCHELL moves to the door.

     EXT. THE OTTOS HOUSE. -- DAY

     MITCHELL leaves the house and moves to his car.  He gets
     inside and closes the door.

     Once inside, MITCHELL opens his briefcase and takes out an
     agreement for the OTTOS.  Something inside the briefcase
     catches his attention.

     ANGLE ON

     A photograph of ZOE.

     MITCHELL stares at this photograph.

                    MITCHELL

          I've done everything the loving
          father of a drug addict is supposed

     INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- EVENING

     MITCHELL and ALISON have finished dinner.  MITCHELL is
     drinking a triple scotch.

                    MITCHELL
                    (continuing from
                    voice over)
          ...I've sent her to the best
          hospitals, she's seen all the best
          doctors.  It doesn't matter.  Two
          weeks later she's on the street.
          New York, Vancouver, Pittsburgh,
          Toronto, L.A.  The next time I hear
          from her, it's a phone call scamming
          for money.  Money for school, or
          money for a new kind of therapist,
 






          or money for a plane ticket home.
          'Oh Daddy, just let me come
          home...Please, Daddy, I have to see
          you...'  But she never comes home.
          I'm always at the airport, but she's
          never there.  Ten years of this, ten
          years of these lies, of imagining
          what happens if I don't send the
          money, of  kicking down doors and
          dragging her out of rat-infested
          apartments, of explaining why that
          couldn't be my daughter in a porn
          flick someone saw...well, enough
          rage and helplessness, and your love
          turns to something else.

          What...does it turn to?

                    MITCHELL
          It turns to steaming piss.

     Pause.  ALISON is shocked by MITCHELL'S intensity.  He
     collects himself.

                    MITCHELL (CONT'D)
          I'm...so sorry.

                    ALISON

     BILLY is sitting in a chair in Room 11, smoking a cigarette.
     The room is dark.  After a while, RISA enters through the
     door and slips inside.

                    RISA
          Have you been waiting long?

                    BILLY
          A while.

                    RISA
          Billy, do you have to smoke?
          Wendell can smell if someone's been
          smoking.

     BILLY gets up to put out his cigarette in the toilet.  He
     notices some work tools in the washroom.

                    BILLY
          What's all this?

                    RISA

          No.  It should be dry by now.

     unbutton her shirt.  RISA stops him, smiles, and kisses
     BILLY.  After a moment, she pulls away, unbuckles her belt,
     and slips off her jeans.  She moves to the bed.

          What time's he coming home?

                    RISA
          When the game's over, I guess.

     BILLY moves to the radio and turns it on, tuning into a
     hockey game.  RISA laughs.  He lowers the volume.  RISA
     takes off her shirt, and moves behind BILLY, kissing his
     neck.  BILLY closes his eyes.

     JESSICA and MASON, BILLY'S children, are being read to sleep

     OF HAMELIN.

                    NICOLE
          The Pied Piper of Hamelin.
          By famous Hanover city;
          The river Weser, deep and wide,
          Washes its wall on the southern
          side;
          A pleasanter spot you never spied;
          But, when begins my ditty...

                    MASON
          What's a ditty again?

                    NICOLE
          It's like a song.

                    MASON
          Oh.

                    NICOLE
 






          When begins my ditty,
          Almost five hundred years ago,
          To see the townsfolk suffer so
          From vermin, was a pity...

                    MASON
          What's vermin again?

                    NICOLE
          Rats!
          They fought the dogs and killed the
          cats,
          And bit the babies in the cradles,
          And ate the cheeses out of vats.
          And licked the soup from the cook's
          own ladles,
          Split open the kegs of salted
          sprats,
          Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,
          And even spoiled the women's chats,
          By drowning their speaking
          With shrieking and squeaking
          In fifty different sharps and
          flats...

          tomorrow?

          Did the Pied Piper take the children
          away because he was mad that the
          town didn't pay him?

                    NICOLE
          That's right.

                    MASON
          Well, if he knew magic - if he could
          get the kids into the mountain - why
          couldn't he use his pipe to make the
          people pay him for getting rid of
          the rats?

                    NICOLE
          Because...he wanted to them to be
          punished.

          The people in the town?

                    NICOLE
          Yes.

                    MASON
          So he was mean?

                    NICOLE
          No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.

                    MASON
          Oh.

          their attention.  I mean, Wendell's
          a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his
          nature.  But Risa, she's still got
          dreams.

     EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- MORNING

     DOLORES opens the door for SEAN.  RISA is wearing a down
     parka over her nightgown and bathrobe and is wearing
     slippers.

                    RISA
          Morning, Dolores.

                    DOLORES
          Hi, Risa.  Aren't your feet
          freezing?

     RISA looks down at her slippers.

                    RISA
          I guess they are.

     SEAN gets to the landing of the bus, then turns around and
     looks at his mother.  He extends his hands like a baby
     wanting to be hugged.

                    SEAN
          I want to stay with you.

     Pause.  RISA stares at her son with great intensity and
     feeling.

                    RISA
          Go on now, Sean.  Go on.

     SEAN turns away and looks into the bus full of children.

                    NICOLE
          C'mon, Sean.  Sit next to me.

     MASON is sitting beside NICOLE.  NICOLE whispers something
     to him, and he makes his way for SEAN.

     MASON goes to the back of the bus and sits beside his
     sister, JESSICA.  SEAN moves tentatively towards NICOLE.

     ANGLE ON

     Back on DOLORES and RISA.

                    DOLORES
          Is he okay?

          I don't know.

          Temperature?

                    RISA
          No.  He's not sick or anything.
          It's just one of those mornings, I
          guess.

          But I never had 'those mornings'
          myself.  Not so long as I had the
          schoolbus to drive.  Not so long as
          I had my kids.

     DOLORES is lost in this memory, realizing she will never
     drive the children again.  A tear runs down her cheek.

     ABBOTT, sensing his wife's mood, activates his electric
     wheelchair and maneuvers himself towards DOLORES.

     MITCHELL watches as DOLORES grasps ABBOTT'S hand.

     EXT. ROAD. -- MORNING

     From BILLY'S point of view, the schoolbus smashes through
     the guardrail and the snowbank.  It plummets down the
     embankment to the frozen-over pond.

     Still upright, the bus slides across the ice to the far
     side.  The ice lets go and the rear half of the yellow bus
     is swallowed at once by the freezing water.  The sound of
     the ice breaking is terrifying.

                    DOLORES
                    (voice over)
          It emerged from the blowing snow on
          the right side of the road.  It
          might have been a dog or a small
          deer or maybe even a lost child.  It
          might have been an optical illusion
          or a mirage.  Whatever it was, for
          the rest of my life I will remember
          that red-brown blur...

          Every time I get on one of these
          flights to rescue Zoe, I remember
          the summer we almost lost her.  She
          was three years old.  It happened in
          the morning, at this cottage we used
          to rent.  We were all sleeping
          together in bed.  It was a wonderful
          time in our lives.  We still thought
          we had a future together, the three
          of us.  Did you ever visit the
          cottage?

          I...don't think so.

                    MITCHELL
          I woke to the sound of Zoe's
          breathing.  It was laboured.  I
          looked over and noticed she was
          sweating and all swollen.  I grabbed
          her, rushed to the kitchen, and
          splashed water on her face.

                    ALISON
          What happened?

                    MITCHELL
          I didn't know.  I was in a panic.  I
          guessed she'd been bitten by an
          insect, but there was no doctor.
          The nearest hospital was forty miles
          away, and Zoe was continuing to
          swell.  Klara took her in her arms
          and tried to breast-feed her, while
          I dialed the hospital.  I finally
          got a doctor on the line.  He
          sounded young, but cool.  He was
          confident, but there was a
          nervousness.  He have been an
          intern.  This was the first time he
          ever had to deal with anything like
          this.  He wanted to seem like he
          knew what he was doing, but he was
          just as scared as I was.

     ALISON stares at MITCHELL, taken by his need to chronicle
     and detail this irrelevant stranger.

     FATHER (YOUNG MITCHELL) is on the phone.  The camera is

     In front of him, MOTHER (KLARA) is breast-feeding the THREE
     YEAR OLD GIRL (ZOE).

                    MITCHELL
                    (voice over)
          He surmised that there was a nest of
          baby black widow spiders in the
          mattress.  He told me they had to be
          babies, or else with Zoe's body
 






          weight she'd be dead.  He told me I
          had to rush her to the hospital.  He
          was alone.  There was no ambulance
          available.  'Now you listen', he
          said, 'There's a good chance you can
          get her to me before her throat
          closes, but the important thing is
          to keep her calm.'  He asked if
          there was one of us she was more
          relaxed with than the other.  I
          said, 'Yes, with me.'

                    MITCHELL
          Which was true enough, especially at
          that moment.  Klara was wild-eyed
          with fear, and her fear was
          contagious.  I was a better actor
          than she was, that's all.  Zoe loved
          us equally then.  Just like she
          hates us both equally now.
                    (beat)
          The doctor told me that I should
          hold her in my lap, and let Klara
          drive to the hospital.  He asked me
          to bring a small, sharp knife.  It
          had to be clean.  There was no time
          to sterilize properly.  He explained
          how to perform an emergency
          tracheotomy.  How to cut into my
          daughter's throat and windpipe
          without causing her to bleed to
          death.  He told me there'd be a lot
          of blood.  I said I didn't think I
          could do it.  'If her throat closes
          up and stops her breathing, you'll
          have to, Mr. Stephens.  You'll have
          a minute and a half, two minutes
          maybe, and she'll probably be
          unconscious when you do it.  But if
          you can keep her calm and relaxed,
          if you don't let her little heart
          beat too fast and spread the poison
          around, then you might just make it
          over here first.  You get going
          now', and he hung up.

          lullaby to his little girl.

          The other part was a surgeon, ready

          for the second that Zoe's breath
          stopped to make that incision.

     of the windows in the rear have gone.  There is a ghostly
     quality to this image, as though the video light is
     searching through the remains of an ancient shipwreck.

     night, absorbing the disturbing energy of the bus.  He hears
     a truck approaching the garage from the distance.  It's
     BILLY ANSEL.  MITCHELL retreats to his parked car as BILLY
     stops his truck in front of the bus and steps out of the
     truck.

     BILLY leaves his headlights on, and they cast dark shadows
     over the inside passenger seats.  BILLY stares at the bus a

          Mr. Mitchell Stephens, Esquire,
          would you be likely to sue me if I
          was to beat you right now?  Beat you
          so bad that you pissed blood and
          couldn't walk for a month.  Because
          that's what I'm about to do.

                    MITCHELL
          No, Mr. Ansel.  I wouldn't sue you.

                    BILLY
          Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the
          people of this town alone.  You
          can't help.

                    MITCHELL
          You can help each other.  Several
          people have agreed to let me
          represent them in a negligence suit.
          Your case as an individual will be
          stronger if I'm allowed to represent
          you together as a group.

          Case?

          The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos.

          important to initiate proceedings

          I'm saying is let me direct your

          Why are you telling me this?

                    MITCHELL
          I'm telling you this because...
          we've all lost our children, Mr.
          Ansel.

                    MITCHELL
          They're dead to us.  They kill each
          other in the streets.  They wander
          comatose in shopping malls.  They're
          paralyzed in front of televisions.
          Something terrible has happened
          that's taken our children away.
          It's too late.  They're gone.

     The phone continues to ring, as BILLY stares at MITCHELL.

     MITCHELL turns to look at the ringing phone.

     INT. DOLORES'S HOUSE -- DAY

     MITCHELL is getting ready to leave.  DOLORES is still
     grasping onto ABBOTT'S hand.

                    DOLORES
          I have a question for you, Mr.
          Stephens.

                    MITCHELL
          What's that, Dolores?
 






                    DOLORES
          I told you that I was doing fifty
          miles an hour when the accident
          happened.  That's how I remembered
          it.  But the truth is, I might have
          been doing sixty.  Or sixty five.
          And if that's true, that I was over
          the limit when the bus went over,
          what would happen then?

                    MITCHELL
          That would complicate things.

                    DOLORES
          Because I'd be to blame, right?

                    MITCHELL
          Billy Ansel will insist that you
          were driving fifty-one miles an
          hour.  Just like you've done every
          morning for the past fifteen years.

                    DOLORES
          He knows that?  Billy?

                    MITCHELL
          Yes.  He does.

                    DOLORES
          Billy said that?

     MITCHELL nods.

                    DOLORES (CONT'D)
          You've talked to Billy?

                    MITCHELL
          I did.

                    DOLORES
          And Billy told you that he'll tell
          that to...

                    MITCHELL
          Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does
          not volunteer to say so in court, I
          will subpoena him and oblige him to
          testify to that effect.

     Pause.  MITCHELL plans his next step.

                    MITCHELL (CONT'D)
          But in order to do that, you must
          let me bring a suit in your name
 






          charging negligent infliction of
          emotional harm.  That's what I'm now
          asking you to consider.

     Pause.  DOLORES is lost.

                    MITCHELL (CONT'D)
          It's clear to me and other people
          that you have suffered significantly
          from this event.

                    DOLORES
          What other people?

                    MITCHELL
          Excuse me?

                    DOLORES
          Who's been talking to you about what
          I'm feeling?  Who should care about
          what I'm feeling?

     MITCHELL stares at DOLORES.

                    MITCHELL
          Dolores, people have to know that
          you've suffered too.

                    MITCHELL
          And they won't understand until you
          let me clear your name - your good
          name - once and for all.  Will you
          let me do that?  Will you let me do
          my duty?

     Suddenly, ABBOTT says something.  He twists his face around
     his mouth, purses his lips on the left side and emits a
     string of broken syllables and sounds.  After this outburst,
     DOLORES looks at MITCHELL, a comforted smile on her face.

                    DOLORES
          You heard what Abbott said?

                    MITCHELL
          Yes.

                    DOLORES
          Anything you didn't understand?

                    MITCHELL
          There might have been a word or two
          that slipped by.  Maybe you could
          clarify it for me, just to be
          absolutely sure.
 







                    DOLORES
          Abbott said that the true jury of a
          person's peers is the people of her
          town.  Only they, the people who
          have known her all her life, and not
          twelve strangers, can decide her
          guilt or innocence.  And if I have
          committed a crime, then it's a crime
          against them, so they are the ones
          who must decide my punishment.

     MITCHELL stares at ABBOTT, who stares back.

                    MITCHELL
          That's what he said, is it?

                    DOLORES
          Yes.  Abbot understands these
          things.

     EXT. DOLORES'S HOUSE -- DAY

     MITCHELL leaves the DRISCOLL house, watched by DOLORES.

     INT. HOSPITAL -- MORNING

     NICOLE BURNELL is in bed.  A doctor, DR. ROBESON, is
     touching her forehead.  NICOLE'S family (SAM, her mother
     MARY, and her little sister JENNY)

                    DR. ROBESON
          The mind is kind.

     The camera fixes on NICOLE'S expression as she stares ahead.

                    NICOLE
                    (voice over)
          They say I'm lucky because I can't
          remember the accident.

                    SAM
          Don't even try to remember.

                    MARY
          You just think about getting well,
          Nicole, that's all.

     The camera is always fixed on NICOLE'S face when her voice
     over is heard.

                    NICOLE
 






                    (voice over)
          I know I'm as well as I ever can be
          again.  So shut up, Mom.  To stay
          like this, to live like a slug, I'm
          going to have to work like someone
          trying to get into the Olympics.

                    SAM
          Just wait till you see what we've
          got waiting for you at home.

     her family.

                    NICOLE
                    (voice over)
          It's an incredible relief to be
          leaving the hospital.  I'm so sick
          of looking at my doctor, listening
          to Frankenstein ask me stupid
          questions about what I was
          feeling...

                    continuing)
          He thought it was cute when I called
          him Frankenstein.  It wasn't.  I
          feel like his monster.

                    MARY
          Isn't it a lovely day?

                    NICOLE
          What happened to summer?

                    MARY
          Summer's over.  It's fall.

                    NICOLE
          And winter?

                    MARY
          Well, winter's far behind us now.
 







                    NICOLE
          How was it?

                    MARY
          We had a terrible winter last year,
          didn't we, Sam?

     SAM nods.

                    NICOLE
          Good thing I was in Florida.

     MARY doesn't know quite what to make of NICOLE'S joke.  SAM
     flashes NICOLE a smile.  She doesn't return it.

     EXT. BURNELL HOME -- DAY

     NICOLE arrives at home.  The car pulls up in front of the
     modest house.

     SAM opens the door and puts the wheelchair up next to it.
     He points out the ramp he has built for NICOLE.

     The ramp is painted green.

                    SAM
          How do you like it, Nicole?

                    NICOLE
          The ramp?

                    SAM
          Pretty slick, eh?

                    NICOLE
          Very slick.

                    SAM
          Do you like the colour?

                    NICOLE
          It's okay.

                    SAM
          And I had to widen a few doors.
          You'll see.

     INT. BURNELL HOME -- DAY
 






     Inside the house.  The interior of the house is dark and
     somewhat tawdry.  The BURNELL'S are almost poor.

     But SAM then leads NICOLE into the special room he has built
     for her.  It seems like another world.  Every detail has
     been lovingly attended to.  No expense has been spared to
     make this room as attractive and inviting as possible.

     A room that a guilty, abusive father might dream up for his
     crippled daughter.

                    SAM
          What do you think?

     Pause.  NICOLE wheels around, trying to control her emotions
     as she inspects the room.  A phone rings in the background.
     MARY goes to answer it.

     NICOLE fixes her gaze at the back of the door.

                    NICOLE
          The door needs a lock.

                    SAM
                    (taken aback)
          Sure.  I'll fix it right away.

     SAM goes to get his tools.  JENNY stares at NICOLE.

                    JENNY
          Can I come and visit you here?

                    NICOLE
          You better.  And you can sleep in my
          new bed with me too.

     NICOLE grabs her sister's hand, and JENNY moves in close to
     her.  SAM comes back with the tools.  He starts to screw in
     the hook.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
          That's too high.  I'll never reach
          it.

                    SAM
                    (nervous)
          Oh.  I better get some spackle.

     SAM leaves again.

                    JENNY
          Mommy says you need to lock the boys
          out.
 






                    NICOLE
          What boys?

                    JENNY
          I don't know.

     NICOLE stares at JENNY, as MARY comes back into the room.

                    MARY
          So do you like your new room?

                    NICOLE
          It's interesting.

                    MARY
          Your Dad spent all his spare time in
          here.  He wanted to make it
          absolutely perfect.

                    NICOLE
          I feel like a princess.

     SAM comes back and begins to work on the door.  NICOLE
     watches him.  She notices a new computer on a desk.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
          Is this mine?

                    MARY
          Yes.  It's a present.

                    NICOLE
          From you?

                    MARY
          No.  From Mr. Stephens.  That was
          him on the phone just now.  He was
          calling to see how you were.

                    NICOLE
          Who's Mr. Stephens?

                    SAM
          He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.

                    NICOLE
          You and Mom have a lawyer?

                    SAM
          Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.

                    NICOLE
          My lawyer?  Why do I need a lawyer?
 






                    MARY
          Maybe we shouldn't be talking about
          this just now, with you barely home.
          Aren't you hungry, honey?  Want me
          to fix you something?

                    NICOLE
          No.  What's this lawyer business?

     MARY turns to JENNY.

                    MARY
          Jenny, why don't you go and play
          outside?

     JENNY looks at NICOLE.

                    JENNY
          He's given me some stuff too.  Toys,
          and some books...

                    MARY
          Jenny.

     JENNY turns to leave.  When she's outside, MARY continues.

                    MARY (CONT'D)
          He's a very kind man.  And he knew
          that you'd need a computer for doing
          schoolwork.

     EXT. BURNELL HOME. PORCH -- DAY

     NICOLE wheels her chair to the exterior porch, where she
     watches her sister climb a tree.  SAM follows her outside.



                    SAM
          It's because of the accident,
          Nicole.  Most people in this town
          whose kids were on the bus have got
          lawyers.  A lot of people...well,
          people in this town are very angry.
          Us included.

                    NICOLE
          But you didn't lose me.

                    MARY
          No, honey.  And we will thank the
          Lord for that every day and night
 






          for the rest of our lives.  But you
          almost died, and you were badly
          injured, and you won't be...you
          can't...

                    NICOLE

     ANGLE ON

     NICOLE'S P.O.V. of JENNY playing on a tree branch.

                    SAM
          You're going to need special care
          for a long time to come.  It's not
          going to be easy.  Not for you, not
          for any of us.  Because we love you
          so much.  And it's going to cost
          money.  More than we can imagine.

                    NICOLE
          What about insurance?  Doesn't
          insurance pay for these things?

                    SAM
          Partly.  But there's a lot the
          insurance doesn't cover.  That's one
          of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To
          make sure the insurance gets paid
          and to help us look after the rest.

                    NICOLE
          How will he do that?

                    SAM
          Well, Mr. Stephens is representing
          several families.  The Ottos, the
          Walkers, us, and I think a couple
          more.  Mr. Stephens is suing the
          town for negligence.  He's sure that
          the accident could have been avoided
          if they had done their jobs right.
          He's a very smart man.

     NICOLE stares at her sister who's at the top of the tree.
     JENNY turns to look back at NICOLE.

     There's a tension, as it seems as though JENNY is going to
     let herself fall.

                    NICOLE
                    (voice over)
          That's the first thing I heard about
          you.  That you were a smart man.
 






          That you  were so smart that you
          were going to sue the town, then
          make us all feel better...

          You're good at that.  Good at

          they could never do for themselves.

     MITCHELL breaks the silence.

          That's my daughter.  Or it may be
          the police to tell me that they've
          found her dead.  She's a drug
          addict.

     The camera follows him, as BILLY moves back to his truck in
     the background.  MITCHELL gets in his car and picks up the
     phone.

          I'm calling because I've got some
          news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.

                    MITCHELL
          News?

                    ZOE
          Don't you want to hear?

                    MITCHELL
          Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.

                    ZOE
          You always think you know what I'm
          going to say, don't you?  You always
          think you're two steps ahead of me.
          The lawyer.

                    MITCHELL
          Tell me your news, Zoe.

                    ZOE
          Okay.  I went to sell blood
          yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm
          in this fucking city where my father
          is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm
          selling my blood.

                    MITCHELL
          That's not news, Zoe.

                    ZOE
          No.  But this is.  They wouldn't
          take my blood.

          Do you know what that means, Daddy?
          Does it register?

          Yes.

                    ZOE
          I tested positive.

          Yes.

          Welcome to hard times, Daddy.

     Pause.

          What do you want me to do, Zoe?
          I'll do whatever you want.

                    ZOE
          I need money.

                    MITCHELL
          What for?

                    ZOE
          You can't ask me that!  Not anymore!
          You asked me what I wanted.  Not
          what I wanted it for.  I want money.

                    MITCHELL
          Do you have the blood test?

                    ZOE
          You don't believe me?  You don't
          fucking believe me?

                    MITCHELL
          Of...course I do.  I just
          thought...I could get you another
 






          test.  In case the one you got...was
          wrong.

                    ZOE
          I like it when you don't believe me,
          Daddy.  It's better you don't
          believe me but have to act like you
          do.

     Pause.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          I can hear you breathing, Daddy.

                    MITCHELL
          Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.

     ZOE begins to cry over the phone.

                    ZOE
          Oh God, I'm scared.

                    MITCHELL
          I love you, Zoe.  I'll be there
          soon, and I'll take care of you.  No
          matter what happens.  I'll take care
          of you.

     MITCHELL meets NICOLE.  SAM and MARY are also seated at the
     table.

     The meeting takes place in the kitchen/diningroom.

                    MITCHELL
          Well, Nicole, I've been wanting to
          meet you for a long time now.  Not
          just because I've heard so many good
          things about you, but because, as
          you know, I'm the guy representing
          you and your mom and dad and some
          other folks here in town.  We're
          trying to generate some
          compensation, however meager, for
          what you have suffered, and at the
          same time see that an accident like
          this never happens again.  You're
          central to the case I'm trying to
          build, Nicole.  But you'd probably
          just as soon let the whole thing
          lie.  Just get on with your life as
          quickly and smoothly as possible.

     NICOLE nods.  Pause, as MITCHELL waits for her to go on.

                    NICOLE
          I don't like thinking about the
          accident.  I don't even remember it
          happening.  Besides, it just makes
          people feel sorry for me, and...

                    MITCHELL
          You hate that.

     NICOLE nods.

                    SAM
          What she means, Mitch...

     MITCHELL silences SAM with a gesture of his hand.

                    MITCHELL
          People can't help it, you know.
          They really can't.  When they see
          you in this wheelchair, knowing what
          your life was life eight months ago,
          people are going to feel sorry for
          you.  There's no way around it,
          Nicole.  You and I just met, and
          already I admire you.  Who wouldn't?
          You're a brave tough smart kid.
          That's obvious.  And I didn't know
          you, know how exciting and promising
 






          your life was before the accident.
          But listen, even I feel sorry for
          you.

                    NICOLE
          You can only feel lucky that you
          didn't die for so long.  Then you
          start to feel...unlucky.

                    MITCHELL
          That you didn't die?  Like the other
          children?

                    NICOLE
          Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins
          and Sean and...

                    MARY
          Nicole!

                    NICOLE
          It's the truth.

     MITCHELL regards MARY with calm authority, as though he's
     telling her the time.

                    MITCHELL
          It is the truth.

     Pause.  MITCHELL looks back at NICOLE.

                    MITCHELL (CONT'D)
          It would be strange if you didn't
          feel that way.

                    NICOLE
                    (after a slight
                    pause)
          What do you want me to do for you,
          Mr. Stephens?

     from another room, as MARY appears from the kitchen with a
     plate of cookies.

                    NICOLE
                    (voice over)
 






          That got you talking about
          depositions and lawyers.  By the
          time Daddy came back from the
          washroom and Mom came in with her
          tea and cookies, you were going on
          about how tough it would be for me
          to answer some of the questions
          those other lawyers would ask .

                    MITCHELL
          They work for the people we're
          trying to sue.  Their job is to try
          to minimize damages.  Our job,
          Nicole, is to try to maximize them.
          You have to think of it that way.
          As people doing their jobs.  No good
          guys or bad guys.  Just our side and
          their side.

                    NICOLE
          I won't lie.

                    MITCHELL
          I don't want you to lie.

                    NICOLE
          The truth is that it was an
          accident, and no one's to blame.

                    MITCHELL
          There's no such thing as an
          accident, Nicole.  Not in a
          situation like this.

                    NICOLE
          You seem very sure about that.

                    MITCHELL
          I'm absolutely positive.

     NICOLE turns to face SAM.  She stares at him.

                    NICOLE
          No matter what I'm asked, I'll tell
          the truth.

     SAM looks back, expressionless.

                    MITCHELL
          That's fine.  I want you to be
          absolutely truthful.  And I'll be
          right there to advise and help you.
          And there'll be a court stenographer
          there to make a record of it, and
 






          that's what'll go to the judge,
          before the trial is set.  It'll be
          the same for everybody.  They'll be
          deposing the Ottos and the Walkers,
          the bus driver...

                    NICOLE
          Dolores.

                    MITCHELL
          Yes.  Dolores...and even your mom
          and dad.  But I'll make sure you go
          last.

                    NICOLE
          Why?

                    MITCHELL
          So you can keep on getting well
          before you have to go and do this.
          It's not going to be easy, Nicole.
          Do you understand that?

     NICOLE nods.

                    SAM
          When do they award damages?

                    MITCHELL
          Depends.  This could drag on for
          quite a while.  But we'll be there
          at the end, Sam.  Don't you worry.

                    NICOLE
                    (voice over)
          At that moment, I hated my parents -
          Daddy for what he knew and had done,

                    NICOLE
          and even Mom for what she didn't
          know and hadn't done.  You told me
          it wasn't going to be easy.  But as
          I sat there, staring at Daddy, I
          knew it was going to be the easiest
          thing in my life.

          He never took his eyes off his
          mother, even as he moved to sit
          beside Nicole.  He looked
          frightened.

                    MITCHELL
          Why would he be frightened?

                    DOLORES
          I don't know.  But it was weird in
          terms of what happened next.  Sean
          was still watching his mother.

                    DOLORES
          I shut the door with one hand, and
          released the brake with the other,
          and waited for a second for Risa to
          cross in front of the bus.  There
          was a sixteen wheeler behind me, and
          I heard his air brakes hiss as the
          driver chunked into gear.  I looked
          into the side view mirror, and saw
          him move into line behind me.  Then

          Sean was all over me, scrambling
          across my lap to the window.  I
          glimpsed  Risa off to my left,
          leaping out of the way of a red Saab
          that seemed to have bolted out of
          nowhere.

     The scene is horrifying, as SEAN watches his mother just
     missing a terrible accident with the speeding vehicle.

          walked slowly back to the office.  I
          drew a couple of breaths and checked

                    SAM
          Was he drinking?  Could you tell?

                    MARY
          Jenny, it's time for you to go to
          bed.

                    JENNY
          Mom...

                    SAM
          Come on, Jen.  I let you watch your
          nature show.

     JENNY reluctantly kisses her father goodnight, then NICOLE.
     As she leaves the room, MARY starts clearing the table.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          Is he coming over now?  Right away?

                    MARY
          That's what he said.

     SAM is anxious.  He looks over to NICOLE.

                    SAM
          What are you up to, Nicole?

                    NICOLE
          Nothing.

                    SAM
          Nothing good on your T.V.?

                    NICOLE
          As opposed to this T.V.?
 






     NICOLE stares at SAM.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
          Besides, I'd like to see Billy.

     NICOLE stares at the television.

     ANGLE ON

     On the television screen, an image of a studio audience
     applauding.  The image is silent.  The T.V. is on MUTE.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
                    (voice over)
          That wasn't true.  I didn't want to
          be seen by anyone whose kids had
          been killed by the accident.
          Especially not Billy Ansel.

     NICOLE turns her attention back to her parents.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
          Actually, now that I think about it,
          I'd just as soon stay in my room.

     NICOLE shoves her wheelchair towards her room, as the camera
     remains on her face.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
                    (voice over)
          I remembered all the times I had
          tucked Jessica and Mason into bed.
          How they loved to have me read to
          them before they slept.  There was
          nothing for me to say to Billy,
          except I'm sorry.  I'm sorry that
          your children died when my parent's
          children didn't.

                                     CUT TO

     EXT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT

     BILLY pulls up to the BURNELL home.  He gets out of his pick
     up and approaches the house.

                                     CUT TO

     INT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT

     From her room, NICOLE watches as BILLY approaches the house.
 






     He leaves her view as a knock is heard at the door.  NICOLE
     wheels over to the door and presses her ear to the door so
     that she can hear the conversation.

                                     CUT TO

     INT. BURNELL HOME.  KITCHEN. -- NIGHT

                    SAM
          Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on
          a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take
          a load off.

                    MARY
          Would you like a cup of tea, Billy?
          There's a piece of cake left.

                    BILLY
          No.  No, thanks, Mary.

                                     CUT TO

     INT. BURNELL HOME.  KITCHEN/LIVINGROOM -- NIGHT

     SAM leads BILLY into the livingroom.

                    SAM
          So what brings you out tonight?

                    BILLY
          Well, Sam, I might as well tell you
          the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've
          gotten yourself all involved with.
          I want you to drop the damned thing.

     Pause.

                    SAM
          I don't see how that concerns you,
          Billy.

                    BILLY
          It does concern me.

                    SAM
          Well, I don't know why it should.
          There's a whole lot of people in
          town involved with lawsuits.  We're
          hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean,
          I can understand how you feel.

                    BILLY
          How?
 






                    SAM
          Well, it being so depressing and
          all.  But it's reality.  You can't
          just turn this off because you
          happen to think it's a bad idea.

                    BILLY
          Why not?

                    SAM
          Because it's what we have to do.

                    BILLY
          Well I don't want a damned thing to
          do with it.

                    SAM
          Okay, fine.  So...stay out of it.

     Pause.  BILLY stares at SAM.  Tension.

                    BILLY
          I've tried to stay out of it.  But
          it turns out that's not so easy,
          Sam.  You've gone and got yourself
          this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens.
          You and Risa and Wendell and the
          Ottos.

                    SAM
          So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got
          lawyers.

                    BILLY
          But yours is the one who's going to
          subpoena me, Sam.  Force me to
          testify in court.  He came by the
          garage this afternoon.  Gave me this
          piece of paper.

     BILLY reaches into his pocket and shows the paper to SAM.

                    MARY
          Why would he do that?  You didn't
          have anything to do with the
          accident.

                    BILLY
          Because I was driving behind the
          bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw
          it happen...

     BILLY is harrowed by this image.  SAM and MARY stare at him,
     frightened by his intensity.
 







                    BILLY (CONT'D)
          If that bastard does subpoena me, if
          he forces me to go over this again,
          then all those other lawyers will
          line up behind him and try and do
          the same thing.

                    SAM
          That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch
          Stephens' case is small, compared to
          some of those other guys.  The way
          he told me, all he needs is for you
          to say what you saw that day,
          driving behind the bus.  I know it's
          a painful thing to do, but it'll
          only take a few minutes of your
          time.  That'll be the end of it.

                    BILLY
          That's wrong, Sam.  You know that.
          We'll be tangled up in this thing
          for the next five years.  This is
          never going to go away...

                    SAM
          C'mon, you know that won't...

                    BILLY
          We've got lawyers suing lawyers
          because some people were stupid
          enough to sign on with more than one
          of the bastards.  We've got people
          pointing fingers, making side deals,
          and dickering over percentages.
          Yesterday, I heard somebody wants to
          sue the rescue squad.  The rescue
          squad.  Because they didn't act fast
          enough.

     ANGLE ON

     NICOLE listening from her door.

                    BILLY (CONT'D)
          If you two dropped the case, then
          the others would come to their
          senses

                    BILLY
          and follow.  You're good sensible
          parents, you and Mary.  People
          respect you.
 






     Pause.

                    SAM
          No, Billy.  We can't drop the
          lawsuit.  You know how much we need
          the money.

                    BILLY
          Why?  You got money from Dolores'
          insurance with the school board.  We
          all did.

                    SAM
          It's not enough.  For hospital
          bills.  For Nicole.

                    BILLY
          I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's
          what you're really talking about.
          I'll even give you the money I got
          for my kids.
                    (beat)
          That's what we used to do, remember?
          Help each other.  This was a
          community.

                    SAM
          I'm sorry.

     BILLY stares at SAM.

                    BILLY
          I used to like it here.  I used to
          care about what happened.  Now I
          think I'll sell my house and move
          the fuck away.

                    MARY
          Billy, please.  The children.

                    BILLY
          The children.

     BILLY looks at SAM and MARY, s strange smile on his face.
     He moves to leave.  He pauses at the door of the kitchen.

                    BILLY (CONT'D)
          How is Nicole?  Is she around?

                    MARY
          She's resting.  In her room.

                    BILLY
          Say hello for me.
 







                                     CUT TO

     EXT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT

     BILLY walks to his car.  SAM and MARY watch him from the
     porch/ramp.

                    SAM
                    (calling out)
          We're getting on with our lives,
          Billy.  Maybe it's time you got on
          with yours.

     BILLY turns around, looks at SAM one final time, then moves
     to his pick up.

                                     CUT TO

     INT. BURNELL HOME -- NIGHT

     NICOLE is watching BILLY from her window.  She is crying.

     ANGLE ON

     NICOLE'S P.O.V. of BILLY driving away.

                                     CUT TO

     INT. BURNELL HOME.  NICOLE'S BEDROOM. -- NIGHT

     NICOLE is lying in her bed.  A knock at the door.  SAM
     enters the dark bedroom and sits on the bed beside her.

                    SAM
          Are you sleeping?

                    NICOLE
          No.

                    SAM
          Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants
          you to make your deposition at the
          courthouse.  I thought I'd take you
          over.

                    NICOLE
          Great.

                    SAM
          You seem...I don't know...well,
          distant, I guess.  Hard to talk to.

                    NICOLE
 






          We used to talk a lot, didn't we,
          Daddy.  About all the things you
          were going to do for me.

                    SAM
          What do you mean?

                    NICOLE
          I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now.
          It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful
          rock star.  Not like you used to
          tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the
          people that were going to discover
          me?  Where are they now?

     SAM turns away from NICOLE.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
                    (voice over)
          He couldn't look at me.  But I
          looked at him.  Right at him.  His
          secret was mine now.  We used to
          share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I
          owned it completely.

                    SAM
          Well, okay.  I'll take you about
          nine-thirty in the morning.  That's
          okay with you?

                    NICOLE
          Great.

     Silence.  SAM gets up to leave the room.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
                    (voice over)
          Before, everything had been so
          confusing.  I never knew who was to
          blame.  But now I know.  He's just a
          thief, a sneaky thief who had robbed
          his daughter.  Robbed me
          of...whatever it was that my sister
          still had and I didn't.  And then
          the accident robbed me of my body.

                                     CUT TO

     INT. CAR -- DAY

     SAM and NICOLE are driving to town.  They don't exchange a
     word.

                                     CUT TO
 







     EXT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY

     SAM is carrying NICOLE up the stairs of the community
     centre.

     There is no ramp, so the wheelchair is left at the bottom.

     He is having difficulty, because NICOLE is keeping her body
     stiff and won't hold on to him.

                                     CUT TO

     INT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY

     NICOLE is wheeled across the floor of the community centre
     to a table where the depositions are being made.  MITCHELL,
     SCHWARTZ, and the STENOGRAPHER are waiting for her.

                    NICOLE
                    (voice over)
          The last time I was in the community
          hall was for the big Christmas party
          almost a year ago.  It hadn't
          changed.

                                     CUT TO

     INT. COMMUNITY CENTRE. -- DAY

     The deposition.  SAM watches his daughter as she speaks
     confidently into the microphone.  The STENOGRAPHER takes
     notes.

     NICOLE is answering questions from the opposing lawyer.
     MITCHELL is also taking notes.

                    SCHWARTZ
          Now on that morning, did there come
          a time, Nicole, when you left your
          parents' house?

                    NICOLE
          Yes.

                    SCHWARTZ
          What time in the morning was this?

                    NICOLE
          About eight-thirty in the morning.

                    SCHWARTZ
          Was anyone waiting for the bus with
          you?
 







                    NICOLE
          No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny
          was sick and stayed home that day.

                    SCHWARTZ
          Was there anything unusual about the
          driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus
          that particular morning?

                    NICOLE
          Like what?  I mean, I don't remember
          a lot.

     ANGLE ON MITCHELL

                    MITCHELL
          I object to the form of that
          question.  Note that.

                    SCHWARTZ
          Was the bus on time?

                    NICOLE
          Yes.

                    SCHWARTZ
          And where did you sit that morning?

                    NICOLE
          My usual place.  On the right side.
          The first seat.

                    SCHWARTZ
          And according to your recollection,
          there was nothing unusual about the
          drive that morning?

                    NICOLE
          Until the accident?  No.
                    (beat)
          Yes, there was.

     ANGLE ON MITCHELL

     Worried about this new information.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
          It was when Sean Walker got on.  He
          was crying and didn't want to leave
          his mother.  Mason Ansel was sitting
          beside me.  I asked him to move, so
          I could quiet Sean down.  When the
          bus started up, a car came around
 






          the corner and almost hit Sean's
          mother.  She was okay, but it really
          scared Sean, because he watched it
          out the window.

                    SCHWARTZ
          And was this incident caused in any
          way by anything the driver of the
          bus did?

     Pause.  MITCHELL is nervous.

                    NICOLE
          No, she hadn't even started to move
          the bus.  It was the car's fault.

     MITCHELL is relieved.

                    SCHWARTZ
          There was nothing reckless in Mrs.
          Driscoll's behavior?

                    MITCHELL
          I object to that form of question.
          Note that.

                    NICOLE
                    (answering the
                    question)
          No.

                    SCHWARTZ
          Did there come a time when all the
          children had been picked up?

                    NICOLE
          Yes.

                    SCHWARTZ
          You remember that much?

                    NICOLE
          As I'm talking, I'm remembering more
          about it.

     MITCHELL is worried.

                    MITCHELL
          Note my objection.  She said, 'As
          I'm talking.'

                    SCHWARTZ
          Did there come a time when the bus
          turned off Staples Mill Road onto
 






          the Marlowe Road at what's called
          Wilmot Springs?

                    NICOLE
          Yes.

                    NICOLE
          There was a brown dog that ran
          across the road up there, right by
          the dump, and Dolores slowed down
          not to hit him, and he ran into the
          woods.  And then Dolores drove on
          and turned onto the Marlowe road, as
          usual.  I remember that.  I'm
          remembering it pretty clearly.

                    SCHWARTZ
                    (eyebrows raised)
          You are?

                    NICOLE
          Yes.

                    MITCHELL
                    (worried)
          Note that she said 'pretty clearly'.
          Not 'clearly'.

                    SCHWARTZ
          And what was the weather like at
          this time?

                    NICOLE
          It was snowing.

                    MITCHELL
          Unless the report from the National
          Weather Bureau for the district on
          January 23 goes into the record, I
          will object to that question.

                    SCHWARTZ
          I will offer that report.  Well,
          then, now that your memory seems to
          be clearing, can you tell us what
          else  you observed at that time?

                    NICOLE
          Before the actual accident?

                    SCHWARTZ
          Yes.

     NICOLE stares at her father as she responds.
 







                    NICOLE
          I was scared.

                    SCHWARTZ
          Why were you scared?

                    SCHWARTZ
          This is before the accident, Nicole.
          Do you understand what I'm asking?

                    NICOLE
          Yes, I understand.

                    SCHWARTZ
          Why were you scared?

                    NICOLE
          Dolores was driving too fast.

     Silence.  MITCHELL is watching his entire case crumble.

                    SCHWARTZ
          Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast?
          What made you think that, Nicole?

                    NICOLE
          The speedometer.  And it was
          downhill there.

                    SCHWARTZ
          You could see the speedometer?

                    NICOLE
          Yes.  I looked.  I remember clearly
          now.  It seemed we were going too
          fast down the hill.  I was scared.

     NICOLE looks at MITCHELL, who stares back.

                    SCHWARTZ
          How fast would you say Mrs. Driscoll
          was going?  To the best of your
          recollection?

                    NICOLE
          Seventy-two miles an hour.

                    SCHWARTZ
          Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're
          sure of this?

                    NICOLE
          Positive.
 







                    SCHWARTZ
          You believe that the bus driven by
          Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy-
          two miles an hour at this time?

                    NICOLE
          I told you I was positive.  The
          speedometer was large and easy to
          see from where I was.

     ANGLE ON

     The speedometer from NICOLE'S P.O.V.  It reads fifty-one
     miles an hour.

                    SCHWARTZ
                    (voice over)
          You saw the speedometer?

                    NICOLE
          Yes.

                    SCHWARTZ
          Did you say anything to Mrs.
          Driscoll?

                    NICOLE
          No.

                    SCHWARTZ
          Why not?

                    NICOLE
          I was scared.  And there wasn't
          time.

                    SCHWARTZ
          There wasn't time?

                    NICOLE
          No.  Because the bus went off the
          road.  And crashed.

                    SCHWARTZ
          You remember this?

                    NICOLE
          Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm
          telling it.

                    MITCHELL
                    (defeated)
 






          She said, 'Now that I'm telling it'.
          Note that.

                    SCHWARTZ
          What do you remember about the
          accident?

                    NICOLE
          I remember the bus swerved, it just
          suddenly swerved to the right, and
          it hit the guardrail and the
          snowbank on the side of the road,
          and then it went over the embankment
          there, and everyone was screaming
          and everything.  And that's all.  I
          guess I was unconscious after that.
          That's all.  Then I was in the
          hospital.

     SCHWARTZ smiles and makes some notes in his pad.  He talks
     to MITCHELL without looking up.

                    SCHWARTZ
          Do you have any questions, Mr.
          Stephens?

     MITCHELL stares silently at NICOLE for a long time.

                    NICOLE
                    (voice over)
          Daddy was leaning forward in his
          chair, his mouth half open, as if he
          wanted to say something.  Like what,
          Daddy?  Like 'What about my money?'

     NICOLE and SAM stare at each other.

                    MITCHELL
          I have no questions.

                    SCHWARTZ
          Thank you, Nicole.

     NICOLE wheels herself away.  She passes MITCHELL.

                    MITCHELL
                    (in a low voice)
          You'd make a great poker player,
          kid.

     NICOLE wheels herself over to her father.

                    NICOLE
          Let's go, Daddy.
 







     EXT. COMMUNITY CENTRE -- DAY

     NICOLE is in the car in front of the community centre.  She
     stares at SAM as he argues with MITCHELL on the steps.

                    NICOLE
                    (voice over)
          Daddy took a long time.  I guess he
          wanted to have a few words with you.
          He must have tried to tell you that
          I was lying.  Then you would tell
          Daddy that it didn't matter if I was
          lying or not, the lawsuit is dead.

     As NICOLE'S words are heard, her point of view of SAM and
     MITCHELL arguing is seen.

     The movement of their lips is in sync with NICOLE'S voice
     over.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
                    (voice over)
          Everyone's lawsuit is dead.  Forget
          it.  Tell the others to forget it.
          It's over.  Right now, Sam, the
          thing you've got to worry about is
          why she lied.  A kid who'd do that
          to her own father is not normal,
          Sam.

     SAM comes down the stairs and enters the car, sitting down
     at the driver's seat.  NICOLE stares at him as he starts the
     car.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
                    (voice over)
          But Daddy knows who lied.  He knows
          who the liar is.  He knows who's
          normal.

     SAM stares ahead, not knowing what to do next.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
                    (speaking to SAM)
          I hope he lets us keep the computer.

     SAM turns to look at NICOLE.

                    NICOLE (CONT'D)
          I'd like an ice cream.

     INT. AIRPORT. -- MORNING

     MITCHELL is at the baggage section of the arrival area,
     waiting for his luggage.

     He watches PETER, the man he met in the washroom changing
     his daughter, playing with the little girl.

     PETER is full of love as he swings the little girl into the
     air as she laughs.

     MITCHELL is caught in a daydream, smiling at the happy image
     of father and daughter.  ALISON approaches him.

                    ALISON
          Well, it was nice meeting you again,
          Mr. Stephens.

                    MITCHELL
          Mitchell.  It was nice to see you
          again, Ally.

                    ALISON
          Alison.

                    MITCHELL

          Say hi to Zoe.

                    MITCHELL
          I will.

                    ALISON
          I hope she gets better.

                    MITCHELL
          I'll tell her that.

     ALISON shakes MITCHELL'S hand, and leaves.

     EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY

     SAM wheels NICOLE along a path away from the same concession
     stand that was seen at the beginning of the film.  NICOLE is
     licking an ice-cream cone.  Around them, people are setting
     up the bandstand.

                    NICOLE
          Daddy, can we come to the fair?
 






                    SAM
          Yes.

                    NICOLE
          How about Sunday night?  That's
          always the best time.

                    SAM
          Okay.

     NICOLE looks at a team of men constructing a ride.  A school
     bus pulls up, and a group of children spill out.  NICOLE
     watches as the driver tries to form them into a group.

                    NICOLE
          What's going to happen to Dolores?

                    SAM
          I don't know.

                    NICOLE
          Will the police do anything to her?

                    SAM
          It's too late for that.  She can't
          drive the bus anymore.  The school
          board saw to that right off.

                    NICOLE
          She'll move away.

                    SAM
          There's talk of that.

                    NICOLE
          Someplace where no one knows her.
                    (beat)
          Someplace strange and new.

     MITCHELL.

     MITCHELL catches her gaze, and the two stare at each other.
