          CREDITS OVER BLACK. Gradually hear the sound of metal
          scraping against asphalt...
           TITLE: Lowell, Massachusetts - 1993

                          FADE IN:

          1 FIVE-CORNER INTERSECTION - LOWELL, MASSACHUSETTS - AFTERNOON.

          2 FORWARD MOVING WALKING STEADICAM WIDE ANGLE POV 2
          Abandoned textile mills on both sides, a two-story flat-iron
          style building splits the roads 100 yards ahead. Still hear
          metal scraping against asphalt.. .then it stops.
          BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF FRAME, a wheelbarrow filled with 250
          pounds of black asphalt edges into frame, followed by the guy
          sweating, struggling as he pushes it, GEORGE "MICKY" WARD
          JR., 31, short, compact, close-cropped reddish-blonde hair,
          little boy face, glancing over his shoulder, dumps the
          wheelbarrow on old cracked cement.. .picks up a scraping-
          spreading tool on a metal broom stick, and commences to
          spread out the new asphalt. Trying to complete a newly paved
          road to the right which ends in this intersection. The
          scraping tool spreading the new asphalt. Micky sweating,
          dirty from asphalt.
          Now skinny bare arms start shadowboxing around Micky working.
          Only the arms enter frame in combinations, shadow punches.

                         MICKY
          (ignoring punches, keeps

                         SPREADING ASPHALT)
          Will you help me finish this?
          He turns and kinda smiles as leans away with the rake, then
          slips and moves with the punches being thrown by RICHARD
          "Dicky" ECKLUND JR., 38, Micky's half-brother, skeleton-like
          arms, backwards baseball cap, shorts, work boots, enters
          frame, shadowboxing around Micky, smiles missing teeth. The
          two brothers play spar, joking, having fun. Micky throws a
          and Dicky play snaps his head back. Then Dicky does it to
          Micky. Then Micky throws an upper cut and Dicky pops his head
          up, broken toy robot.

                         DICKY
          You knocked my block off!
          He resets his head, punches Micky.

                         MICKY
          You knocked my block off!

          He resets his head, Micky throws again, Dicky mimes going
          down, then gets up immediately.

                         MICKY
          (counts like ref)
          -six, seven, eight. [takes Dicky's
          hands] Can you continue? [Dicky
          nods] Who's the president?

                         DICKY
          Five o'clock.
          Micky waves his hands like Dicky's done. Dicky throws another
          play punch and Micky hams up going down, getting knocked out,
          feet flying up in the air.

          He pulls Micky up INTO A BROTHERLY ARM BUMP/HUG HANDS
          CLASPED. Micky smacks the back of Dicky's head as Dicky
          raises Micky's arm in the air like a champ.

          SMASH CUT TO:

          3 STREETS, LOWELL - DAY 3
          Dicky walks like a hero down the streets of working class
          Lowell, locals spilling out of storefronts, lunch counters,
          HBO camera following him.

                         DICKY
          (shadowboxing, moving)
          Look who's here! I'm comin' back,
          Lowell! Micky's gonna win, we got
          HBO here! Look at this --
          He walks down the street like he's running for office, people
          shouting his out his name. . .most everyone knows him...and
          even those who don't are charmed by this toothless Pied
          Piper... some look confused, surprised by his comeback, some
          hold memorabilia from his Sugar Ray Leonard fight to sign. He
          kisses a girl, laughs his missing-toothed grin. Dicky high-
          fives 19-year-old RAY RAMALHO, crew cut, body bent by
          cerebral palsy.

                         DICKY
          Ray Ray! Smile, you're gonna be in
          my movie! HBO's makin' a fuckin'
          movie about me! And my brothah's
          gonna win next week!
          He grabs Micky's arm again, they are trailed by the road crew
          guys (one holds a boom box) walking behind Dicky shaking
          their heads, smiling, following. "Don't Bring Me Down"
          continues... Everybody shouting out Dicky's name, "Dicky!"
          "Dicky!" "Dicky!" Some calling "Micky!" "Micky!" "Micky!"

          .Dicky moves through the crowd, punches the air dancing in
          the dark crowded smoky club, old disco ball scattering light
          on gray carpeted walls, "Don't Bring Me Down" still
          playing...

                         DICKY

                         ALICE
          NO! JESUS! I'm not ready!
          Catch a glimpse of her tough, sexy, fighter's nose, years of
          hard life, bleached-blonde hair, sucking on a Lucky Strike,
          drinking by at a white-topped table cluttered with empty beer
          bottles, overflowing ashtrays, cigarettes burning out.

                         DICKY
          (shouting over music)
          My sistahs!
          Six of Alice's seven daughters ARRIVE, look up as the camera

          smoking Greek chorus that trails Alice everywhere. PAN FROM

          distinctive, hardened face.

                         DICKY

          That's Red Dog, Sherry, the baby,

          Alice runs for the bathroom. Dicky chases after her through
          the crowd and the smoke and the music.

          invoice, holding the pay phone, and gives them all the
          finger. Short & fat.

          In '78 -- we got the offah to fight
          Sugah Ray Leonahd.

                         MICKY
          He just won the Gold Medal at the
          Olympics, Sugar Ray. He was the,
          ya know, the big new welter weight
          at that time.

                         ALICE
          And Dicky was just a kid from
          Lowell.

                         MICKY
          Dicky was undefeated!

                         ALICE
          Dicky had never been knocked down
          in his professional career, neither
          had Sugar Ray. They were both 21-
          yeahs-old.

                         MICKY
          It was Dicky's first ten roundah.

          against Sugar Ray Leonard, right?
          But as his managah, how could I not
          take a Sugah Ray? Do you see what
          I'm saying? It was the biggest
          thing that evah happened to Lowell.

          It's true! Sugar Ray had a hard
          time hitting Dickie, didn't really
          knock him down, but Dicky knocked
          Ray down! I wore a new white
          dress. This fight was gonna change
          our lives forevah, and it did.

          he's doing it. Leonard still hasn't solved his speed, still
          hasn't been able to find him, I think in his own cute way
          Ecklund is making Leonard be the aggressor.."

          Dicky to the mat. "Ecklund smiling again, Ecklund is down!
          Let's see if they call that a knock down." Dicky pops right
          back up and they go to separate corners. "Let's see if they
          call that a knock down. Nope, not a knockdown. And the bell
          rings." "I didn't think that was a knockdown, Don." "I didn't
          think so either Larry, he was wrestled down. Not a
          knockdown."

          think, at least Angelo said he thought that's what has held
          him back. But of course with an opportunity like this perhaps
          he's slowed down his living a little bit."

          Forget about it. Alice, HBO's
          waitin' for us. Sugah Ray's out
          there! C'mon you come too, Mick.
          Dicky heads back out. Alice looks at Micky, pats his cheek
          and follows after Dicky, leaving Micky sitting alone on the
          trainer's table.

          RAAAAAAAY! Hey, Ray,--
          The bodyguard stops him. Sugar Ray sees Dicky and waves him
          over.. .Dicky smiles, missing teeth. The HBO cameraman

          SUGAR RAY LEONARD
          Tough night for your brother, he
          shoulda jabbed more, stayed away.

          It's very sad, ma, I gotta call ya
          back.
          He hangs up. He and Charlene stare at each other, taking it
          in, emotional, awkward. She laughs a little through
          tears. - .they hug.
          Micky crying into her shoulder and hair, Charlene holding
          onto him, she backs him into his BEDROOM, the fall to the
          bed, kissing. FADE OUT -

          Next morning. Micky's hands grab dingy white boxing wraps
          out of the darkness of his messy closet, faded red gloves,
          throws them into an old blue gym bag, leaves. Charlene sits
          up in bed, groggy, gets up in Micky's t-shirt, goes out.

          I wanna meet that guy George told

          cab company.
          Charlene nods, Micky disappears down the stairs; she runs to
          the edge of the balcony, looks down, waits, in a moment
          Micky's back appears from under the porch, walking away. She
          watches him go.

          Of course, how could I stand a
          chance without the Great Dicky
          Ecklund in my corner? You didn't
          care if I got killed with Mungin,
          now all of a sudden, you're worried
          Sanchez is gonna hurt me, why? Cuz
          you're stuck here and you can't be
          center of attention no more.

                         DICKY

          watch ...Neary backs Micky up against the ropes, hitting him
          with everything he's got, pounding hard right after hard
          right ...Bam! Bam! Bam! Merchant, "Vicious body shots from

          mirroring Micky in the ring... covering his face with his
          hands, bobbing his head.. .starts punching, screaming, "Punch
          ya way out of it. Punch out of it!"
          .Micky starts firing at Neary, hear Lampley, "Ward trying
          to trade his way back!"...Neary steps back...Micky slips off
          the ropes and raises his hands over his head, letting Neary
          know he survived. . .And fires a left hook--Right uppercut!
          Lampley, "And Ward hurts Neary with a body shot! Ward hurts
          him again with that left to the body! Neary is wobbled!"
          Micky rocks Neary with another left hook to the body ...Bam!
          Micky follows with a huge left uppercut... Bam!
          Neary stumbles backwards and goes crashing down to the
          canvas! Hear Lampley scream, "Big uppercut by Ward! First
          time in 22 fights that Shea Neary has been down!" Neary gets
          back up to his feet at "Four..." Referee Mickey Vann giving
          him the standing eight-count, "Six... Seven... Eight."
          .Dicky shaking his fist, screaming Micky on, "This is it!
