     FADE IN:

     EXT. DESERT OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST - DAY

     A mountain peak dominates the landscape.


     TITLES BEGIN.

     Riders on horseback cross the desert. From this distance they appear to be a
     company of Army Cavalry Soldiers.

     CLOSER ANGLES ON THE RIDERS

     reveal only details of saddles, hooves and uniforms. The riders are silhouetted
     against the rising sun as they ride into an ancient CLIFF PUEBLO.

     The OFFICER IN COMMAND raises his hand halting his troops.

               OFFICER
          Dis-mount!

     RIDERS climb down from their mounts... and only now do we realize that
     this is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about thirteen years of age. The
     "Commanding Officer" is only their SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock.

     One of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from his horse,
     bends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on him.

                              FIRST SCOUT
          Herman's horsesick!

     A BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of straw-colored
     hair and the no-nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite
     for knowledge exceed what they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his
     uniform with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT.

                              SCOUTMASTER
          Chaps, don't anybody wander off.
          Some of the passageways in here
          can run for miles.

     Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.


     INT. THE PASSAGEWAY - DAY

     The two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the temperature drops
     several degrees. Spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair.

     HERMAN appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise, but he's
     drawn on by his companion's adventurous curiosity.


CONTINUED:

                              HERMAN
          I don't think this is such a good
          idea.

     LAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward its source.

     The VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their source. The light
     of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach
     cautiously, careful to stay hidden.

               HERMAN
          What is it?

     This is what they see:


     FOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken into one of the
     pueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called "Kivas."

     The men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE (a Bowery
     Boy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black hair that cascades over his
     shoulders).

     And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT
     FEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet
     anything that this is INDLANA JONES.

     However, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow,
     we are shocked to discover that it is someone else.

     We'll call him FEDORA.

TITLES END.

     The TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see.

     Now we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA JONES.

                                           FEDORA
                           Alfred, did you get anything yet?
               
               MAN
                          Nothing. Dig in.

     Two of the men stand and look at ROSCOE who steps forward holding a box in his
     hands.

                                 ROSCOE
          Hey, I've got something!

     Whoops from the other men.

                          ROSCOE
          I got something, Garth!

CONTINUED: (2)

     ROSCOE rushes forward and gives FEDORA the box. Fedora steps toward a
     lantern resting on a rock.

                              ROSCOE
          I got something... I got something
          right here.

     More whoops from the other men.

     FEDORA puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. HALFBREED pushes
     ROSCOE as he jumps with excitement. ROUGH RIDER steps forward to look at the
     box as Fedora opens it.

               ROSCOE
                        (more whoops; then)
          Oh, look at thatl
                        (more whoops)
          We're richl We're rich!

                              HALFBREED
          Shut up. Shut up.

     FEDORA takes a BEJEWELED CROSS from the box and holds it aloft. Fedora's
     comrades practically salivate at the sight of it.

                              ROSCOE (O.S.)
          Well, we're rich, ain't we?l

     INDY takes off his hat and looks down at the o.s. action.

                              HERMAN
          Indy? Indy? What are they doing?
          Indiana? Indiana?

                              INDY
          Shhhl

     FEDORA blows dust from the Cross, turning it in his hand, silently appraising its
     beauty... and its value. He seems aloof from the others; somehow superior to
     them.

                              HALFBREED
          Hey, we got to find more stuff
          to bring back.

     INDY stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.

               INDY
                        (hushed; urgent)
          It's the Cross of Coronadol
          Cortes gave it to him in 15201


CONTINUED: (3)

     FEDORA continues to admire the Cross, then places it on the rock next to its box
     and the lantern.

     INDY turns back to observe the men.

                              INDY
          That Cross is an important artifact.
          It belongs in a museum.

     A look of resolve comes into INDY's expression, and he turns back toward
     HERMAN.

                              INDY
          Run back and find the others.
          Tell Mister Havelock that there
          are men looting in the caves.

     HERMAN doesn't seem to be listening. Instead, he watches in wide-eyed horror
     as a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP.

                              INDY
          Have him bring the sheriff.

     INDY matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. HERMAN gasps.

                              INDY
          It's only a snake.

     INDY grabs HERMAN's scout scarf and pulls him closer.

                              INDY
          Did you hear what I said?

                              HERMAN
          Right. Run back. Mister Havelock.
          The Sheriff. What, what are you
          gonna do?

                              INDY
          I don't know... I'll think of
          something.

     INDY releases the scarf, gives HERMAN a pat and Herman dashes off. Indy sees
     the Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As the Robbers continue to search for
     additional valuables, Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of
     the Cross...

     FEDORA looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.

                              FEDORA
          Dig with your hands.

     INDY picks up the Cross.


CONTINUED: (4)

                              FEDORA (O . S . )
          Not with your mouth.

     As FEDORA stands watching the other men digging, INDY puts the Cross in his
     pants and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's
     feet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention.

                              ROSCOE
          He's got our thing!

                HALFBREED
          Get 'im!

                                  

     The three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on INDY, they almost knock
     each other over in the attempt.

     Only FEDORA is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in
     the direction of his fleeing companions—then sets off
     after INDY.


         
     EXT. THE  CLIFFS - DAY

     INDY EMERGES from the darkness of the Pueblo into the brightness of day.

     He pauses—squints—shields his eyes—looks in all directions.

                              INDY
          Mister Havelock! Anybody
          Everybody's lost but me!

     He hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. ROUGH RIDER,
     HALFBREED, and ROSCOE are quick to appear and run after him.

               FEDORA
            There he isl                   

                      MEN
                (AD-LIBS)
          Let's go! Let's get him! Let's
          go!

     Indy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES are below. Indy
     puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES for his horse, who trots over. Indy
     puts the Cross in his belt.

     INDY PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then... he JUMPS. But
     the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a
     standing position. The impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his
     back teeth. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.

     FEDORA AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see INDY climb into
     the saddle and gallop off.


CONTINUED:

                INDY
          Hyahl Hyah!

                     

                                              ROSCOE
          Hey! Come back here!

     FEDORA puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES... and A VINTAGE TRUCK
     AND AUTOMOBILE come ROARING OUT from behind the Pueblo (Driven by two
     more gang members). Now we glimpse...


     THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT

     The passenger in the car. His face is concealed by the hat's wide brim. His arm
     is out the window, however, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from
     the sleeve of an expensive white linen suit. He gestures to the Robbers, now in
     the truck.

                                            PANAMA HAT
          Come on. Get him!

     INDY SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not only keep pace
     with his horse... they begin to squeeze in on it.

     Speeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. INDY crouched
     low and leaning forward in the saddle, his heart pounding, his adrenalin
     pumping.

     INDY VEERS OFF in a new direction—toward a RAILROAD TRACK.


     EXT. A CIRCUS TRAIN - DAY

     The train is barreling down the track. INDY rides up beside it. He glances over
     his shoulder and sees the car and truck gaining on him. No other choice... he
     LEAPS FROM HORSE TO TRAIN.

     He clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER leap from
     the truck onto the train.

     HALFBREED tries to grab INDY, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed
     runs after him but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked
     on a flatcar.

     INDY loses his balance but regains it. With HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER still
     running after him, Indy enters the trap door of...


     INT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY

     and finds himself CRAWLING on a CATWALK suspended from the car's ceiling.
     Several feet below are NUMEROUS VATS containing all manner of reptiles:
     Alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc.


CONTINUED:

     Then, HALFBREED ENTERS through the trap door—followed by ROUGH RIDER.
     Halfbreed grabs hold of INDY's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp.

     INDY crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. HALFBREED grabs at
     Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we SEE large bins of squirming snakes.

     The combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended
     for, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM THE CEILING.

     Everyone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. Too late. SEVERAL
     BOLTS TEAR FREE. HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER SCREAM... but it's Indy's
     end of the catwalk that DROPS DOWN... PLUNGING INDY to the floor of the car.

     He lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he finds himself eye-
     to-eye with an—

     ENORMOUS ANACONDA

     The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

               INDY
          Oh...          

     INDY jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into the SNAKE VAT.

               INDY
          Oh... Oh...

     Hundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. INDY sinks into them. They cover him.
     Engulf him. Almost smother him.

     INDY jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself.

     INDY locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape.

     HALFBREED, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the car. He groans.
     ROUGH RIDER moves to assist him.

               ROUGH RIDER
          Here, let me.



     EXT. THE TRAIN- DAY

     INDY stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. Suddenly he looks
     worried as he frantically reaches into his shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM and
     tosses it away.

     ROSCOE APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab INDY. Indy kicks at
     him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to...

     EXT. A FLATCAR - DAY

     INDY climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. ROSCOE follows, grabbing a
     long stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto
     the roof of the rhino boxcar.


     INT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

     as a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's fall, hitting a HUGE
     BLACK RHINOCEROS.


     EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

     ROSCOE grabs INDY by the ankle and yanks him off his feet. The two struggle,
     rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge.
     Things get even more serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE.


     IN THE BOXCAR BELOW

     ... THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated by the
     commotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises his head and THRUSTS HIS
     HORN THROUGH THE ROOF.

     BACK TO THE ROOFTOP

     as the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from INDY's head. Indy and
     Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle.
     SMASH! The horn comes up again—RIGHT BETWEEN INDY'S LEGS.

                INDY
                             Holy smokes!
                                    

     INDY kicks ROSCOE away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from
     falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach.


     EXT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY

     The WOODEN TRAP DOOR EXPLODES as a BULLET is FIRED from within. The
     door is pushed open and HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER hurry out of the car.


     EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

     INDY gets to his feet—looks ahead—sees a WATER TANK alongside the track
     directly up ahead. Indy gets an idea...

     In an instant, he calculates his approach—times the distance—and LEAPS for
     the tank's WATER SPOUT.


CONTINUED:

     He catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water spout to ROTATE A
     FULL 360 DEGREES. With INDY hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout
     deposits him back on the train, onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks
     up to see FEDORA walking toward him.

                              FEDORA
          Come on, kid. There's no way
          out of this.

     As INDY edges away from FEDORA, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S ROOF
     COLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below.


     INT. THE STOCKCAR - DAY

     INDY CRASHES down from above. Dust rises.

               INDY
                            Ohhh!                                   

     INDY's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. A bit of sunlight leaks in
     through the cracks between the boards.

     Then INDY sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly to its feet... an
     AFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust
     swirls up into the shafts of sunlight.

     And INDY has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged
     from his belt during the fall...

     INDY glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging on a nail. He
     carefully takes it down by the handle. The Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY.

     INDY swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels awkwardly, its TIP
     flying back and HITTING INDY IN THE FACE... CUTTING his chin.

     The Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and
     tries again. This time—success! The WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion
     BELLOWS and SWATS the air... and steps back.

     INDY looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. The Lion backs
     away even more. Indy inches forward—bends down (never taking his eyes off
     the Lion)—picks up the Cross—and steps back again, sweat pouring down his
     face.

     But now... how to get out?

     He looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees FEDORA LOOKING
     DOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand.

                              FEDORA
          Toss up the whip.

     EXT. THE ROOFTOP OF STOCKCAR

     FEDORA, assisted by HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER, "reels" INDY out of the
     Stockcar as the Lion ROARS and lunges and Indy screams.

     The men, including ROSCOE, pull INDY through the hole in the roof. He stands to
     face them as ROUGH RIDER points a gun in his direction.

               FEDORA
                    You've got heart, kid.
                 (indicates Cross)
          But that belongs to me.

                      INDY
                 (takes Cross from his belt)
          It belongs to Coronado.

                      FEDORA
                 (overlapping)
                    Coronado is dead. And so are all
          his grandchildren.

               INDY
          This should be in a museum.

               ROSCOE
                    Now give me thatl

     ROSCOE makes a grab for the Cross—but INDY doesn't let go. A tug-of-war
     ensues until a SNAKE WIGGLES OUT FROM INDY'S SHIRTSLEEVE and WRAPS
     AROUND Roscoe's hand.

     ROSCOE SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER—releases his grip on the Cross and tries
     to shake off the snake. This is all the opportunity Indy needs. He LEAPS ONTO
     THE NEXT CAR.

               FEDORA
                    Don't let him get awayl

     INDY swings down to the caboose. He sees a sign above the caboose door reading
     "DR. FANTASY'S MAGIC CABOOSE."

               INDY
          Magic?

     He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping
     inside.

     FEDORA puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to follow INDY.

               FEDORA
                    Hold it. Make sure he doesn't
          double back.

     INT. THE CABOOSE - DAY

     which contains the circus MAGIC EQUIPMENT. INDY rushes to the rear door of
     the caboose but can't open it. He hears FEDORA coming, and dives into a MAGIC
     BOX.

                              FEDORA
          Okay, kid. out of the box.
          Now.

     FEDORA smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly
     collapses; all four sides flop away... revealing NOTHING. INDY has completely
     vanished.

     FEDORA is mystified, frustrated and angered. Then he feels a breeze at his back.
     He turns and discovers that the caboose door is open. He rushes out onto the
     balcony and sees:

     INDY RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses.


               FEDORA
          Damn.


     EXT. STREET - SMALL TOWN - DAY

     as INDY runs from the railroad tracks and approaches his house we see the name
     "JONES" painted on the mailbox.

                              INDY
          Dad!

     INT. THE HOUSE - DAY

     INDY bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his hand. A Husky
     BARKS as Indy runs past in search of his father.

                              INDY
          Dad!

                              INDY
          Dad!

     INT. THE STUDY - DAY

     INDY charges in. The study is cluttered with books. Pictures, charts and maps
     clearly reflect the father's passion for Medieval studies.

     PROFESSOR HENRY JONES is absorbed at his desk. In fact, he is studying a very
     ancient parchment volume which lies open on the desk. The page shows a
     beautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained-glass window. The
     sketch incorporates a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is not just
     studying it, he is copying it into his own notebook.


CONTINUED:

We never get to see the PROFESSOR's face in this scene.
So INDY CHARGES IN.
                 
               INDY
          Dad!

               HENRY
          Out!

               INDY
          It's important!

               HENRY
          Then wait—count to twenty.

               INDY
          No, Dad. You listen to me—

               HENRY
                                 (now he shouts)
          Junior!

     No question who is the boss here. INDY gulps, his look says "What am I going to
     do with this guy?" And obeys—
     starts counting, VERY, VERY FAINTLY.

               INDY
          One, two, three, four...

     Now we see what HENRY is concentrating on. We see his hand
     sketching; then, he holds up one finger.

               HENRY
          In Greek.

     INDY's reaction:

               INDY
                                (louder, in Greek)
          One... two... three... four...

     An ancient car is heard arriving. Perhaps INDY glimpses it going past the
     window. Anyway, it stops outside the house. Two men sit in the front seat.
     HERMAN sits in the rear, BLOWING A TRUMPET.

     INDY's reaction: Trouble!

     HENRY is just finishing the sketch.

               HENRY
          May he who illuminated this...
          illuminate me...

     INT. THE FRONT ROOM - DAY

     The study door is just closing, INDY closing it behind him... just as HERMAN
     comes through the front door, still playing the trumpet.

     INDY reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from HERMAN's mouth. Herman
     continues to spit—right into Indy's face. Indy flinches.

                              HERMAN
          I brought the Sheriff.

     HERMAN means the SHERIFF, who now enters the house.


                              INDY
          Just the man I want to see! Now,
          there were five or six of them.


                           SHERIFF
                        (interrupting)
          All right, son.

                             INDY
                        (overlapping)
          ... they came after... me...


                                    SHERIFF
          You still got it?

                              INDY
          Well, yes, sir. It's right here!

     INDY shows the CROSS, more or less handing it to the SHERIFF to make his
     point. The Sheriff takes it casually.

                              SHERIFF
          I'm glad to see that... because
          the rightful owner of this Cross
          won't press charges, if you give
          it back.

     FEDORA enters the house, followed by ROSCOE, ROUGH RIDER and HALFBREED.
     He politely removes his hat and holds it in his hand. He nods at INDY in a
     friendly manner.

                              SHERIFF
          He's got witnesses, five or six
          of them.

     The SHERIFF and FEDORA are in Cahoots

     The SHERIFF hands the Cross to FEDORA. ROSCOE reaches in and takes it from
     Fedora, then runs out the door.

               ROSCOE
                     Yahoo!

CONTINUED:

     As ROSCOE runs outside INDY sees—through the screen door—the MAN IN
     THE PANAMA HAT waiting patiently beside the car that is parked out front.
     Roscoe approaches and gives the Man the Cross—the Man hands Roscoe some
     money in exchange.

     The SHERIFF tips his hat and leaves.

               SHERIFF
          Good day.

     FEDORA remains behind for a moment. He turns and speaks to INDY in an ironic
     man-to-man way.

                               FEDORA
               You lost today, kid, but that
          doesn't mean you have to like it.

     Then, FEDORA takes off his hat and takes a step towards INDY. He holds the hat
     by the crown, and puts it on Indy's head, a show of respect and admiration for
     the boy. The hat blocks Indy's face.

     CLOSE ON THE TOP OF THE FEDORA HAT

     The hat brim fills the screen. As the brim tilts up, WE SEE the face of FULL
     GROWN INDIANA JONES.

     And... POW!... he's punched in the face while his arms are pinned behind his
     back.

     FADE IN TITLE: "PORTUGUESE COAST—1938"

                                            PANAMA HAT
          Small world, Doctor Jones.

                                               INDY
          Too small for two of us.

     THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT (years older now) removes the CROSS OF
     CORONADO from Indy's belt.

                                            PANAMA HAT
               This is the second time I've had
               to reclaim my property from you—

                               INDY
               That belongs in a museum—

                               PANAMA HAT
          So do you.
                (he moves his eyeline)
          Throw him over the side.

     THE DECK OF A PORTUGUESE CARGO SHIP

     It's NIGHT. RAIN POURS down. We're in the middle of a violent STORM AT SEA.
     Thirty-foot waves crash across the deck.

     The TWO PORTUGUESE SAILORS (who have Indy's arms pinned behind his back)
     propel INDY across the deck toward the rail.

     As they pass a BUNDLE OF FUEL DRUMS, INDY uses the Two Sailors as leverage
     to KICK UP HIS FEET and break open the CLAMP on the metal bands that hold
     the drums together.

     INDY jabs his elbows into the stomachs of the startled Sailors and rushes toward
     the MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT.

     PANAMA HAT sees INDY coming and hurries toward the ladder that leads up to
     the bridge. Indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes
     his way to where Panama Hat is climbing the ladder. He pulls him off the ladder
     from behind the two men fall down on the deck. Indy takes the cross back from
     Panama Hat.

     A sailor delivers a powerful blow to Indy's face, sending the cross flying out of
     his grip and skittering across the deck. Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two
     sailors who attack him from the sides.

     INDY sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard. He lunges for it.

     He SNATCHES UP the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave.
     He struggles to his feet, managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the
     deck around him.

     SEVERAL MORE DRUMS come INDY's way. He sidesteps them all.

                              PANAMA HAT
          Grab him, he's getting away!
          Grab him!

     Indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. Indy sees a large
     Stevedore's hook above him and he climbs up on crates to reach it. He grabs a
     hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly
     avoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking ocean, still
     holding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly
     onto a crate of TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, sending
     an enormous orange fireball into the sky.

     LONG SHOT - THE BOAT EXPLODING OUT OF THE WATER

     as bits of debris fall from the sky like rain.

     INDY BOBS UP

     in the water amid the debris, holding the Cross in his hand. He grabs for
     something to keep him afloat. It turns out to be one of the ship's LIFE
     PRESERVERS. INDY loops his arm through the preserver.


CONTINUED:

     Only now do we see the FADED LETTERING on the preserver revealing the
     destroyed ship's name and city of port:

                  VAZQUEZ de CORONADO
     BARCELONA

     A SHREDDED PANAMA HAT floats past.

     EXT. COLLEGE - DAY
     Students walk along brick, tree-lined paths.

               INDY (V.O .)
          Archaeology is...


     INT. COLLEGE LECTURE HALL - DAY

     DISSOLVE TO:

     INDY, dressed in professorial tweeds, stands before his class. He turns to the
     blackboard with a piece of chalk and writes the word: "FACT."

                         INDY
          ... the search for fact. Not truth.
          If it's truth you're interested
          in, Doctor Tyree's Philosophy
          class is right down the hall.

     Laughter.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

                         INDY
          So forget any ideas you've got
          about lost cities, exotic travel,
          and digging up the world. Eve
          do not follow maps to buried
          treasure and "X" never, ever,
          marks the spot.


     MARCUS BRODY approaches Indy's classroom. He peers through the window in
     the door to see INDY completing his lecture.

                         INDY
          Seventy percent of all archaeology
          is done in the library. Research.
          Reading.


     INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

     BRODY enters the lecture hall and stands at the rear of the room.


CONTINUED:

                         INDY
          We cannot afford to take mythology
          at face value.

     The BELL RINGS. INDY stands at his desk as students begin to disperse. A
     pretty coed puts a note on the desk.

                         INDY
          Next week: "Egyptology." Starting
          with the excavation of Naukratis
          by Blinders Petrie in 1885. I will
          be in my office if anybody's got
          any problems for the next hour
          and a half.

     BRODY approaches as the last of the students leaves the lecture hall.

               INDY
          Marcus!
                (slaps his pocket)
          I did it!

               BRODY
          You've got itl

     INDY removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk. He places it on the desk
     and takes off his glasses as BRODY examines the Cross.

                         INDY
          You know how long I've been
          looking for that?!

               BRODY
          All your life.

               INDY
          All my life!


                         BRODY
          Well done, Indy. Very well done,
          indeed This will find a place
          of honor in our Spanish collection.

     INDY gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door.

                         INDY
          We can discuss my honorarium over
          dinner and champagne tonight.

     He turns back toward BRODY, now holding the Cross.

               INDY
          Your treat.

               BRODY
          Yes. My treat.

     INT. INDY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

     Bursting with STUDENTS, all competing for his attention at once: "Professor
     Jones! " "Doctor Jonesl " etc., etc.

                         INDY
          Shush! Shush! Shushl

     INDY shoulders his way to the desk of his secretary, an overwhelmed Teaching
     Assistant named IRENE.

                         IRENE
          Doctor Jones! I'm so glad you're
          back! Your mail is on your desk.
          Here are your phone messages.

                         MALE STUDENT
          Doctor Jones, you promised...
          Doctor Jones—

                         IRENE
          This is your appointment schedule.
          And these term papers still haven't
          been graded.

     INDY takes the term papers then turns to enter his PRIVATE OFFICE. Students
     once again CLAMOR for his attention: "Doctor Jones!" "Wait, Doctor Jonesl"
     "My grade!" "Sign my registration card!"

     INDY silences the mob with a raised hand.

               INDY
                  (very efficiently)
          Okay. Irene, put everyone's name
          on a list, in the order they
          arrived, and I'll see each and
          every one of them in turn.

     The Students descend upon poor IRENE, each claiming to be first. INDY slips into
     his -

     PRIVATE OFFICE

     where he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a foreign postmark on it.

               INDY
                  (softly; reading)
          "Venice, Italy."

     Then, INDY stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to the WINDOW, slides it
     open and STEPS OUT INTO THE GARDEN.


     EXT. SIDE OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY

     INDY escapes through the garden.

     EXT. FRONT OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY

     INDY walks briskly toward the street; smiling, erUoying his freedom. As he
     arrives at the curb, a LONG BLACK PACKARD SEDAN pulls up before him.


               MAN (O.S.)
          Doctor Jonesl

     THREE MEN step out of the sedan. Everything about them bespeaks "G-MAN."
     The First Man steps behind Indy.

                         MAN
          Doctor Jones?

     INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY

     INDY is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left alone. Numerous
     museum-quality artifacts are displayed around the room. Indy takes this
     opportunity to examine them.

     After a moment, WALTER DONOVAN enters from across the room. During the
     brief time that the door is open, we HEAR a COCKTAIL PARTY going on in the
     next room: VOICES and SOFT PIANO MUSIC.

     DONOVAN strides across the room toward INDY. Although in his late fifties,
     Donovan has the broad shoulders and trim physique of a much younger man.
     Dressed in a tuxedo, he exudes both confidence and power.

                         DONOVAN
          I trust your trip down was
          comfortable, Doctor Jones. My
          men didn't alarm you, I hope.

     He shakes hands with INDY.

                         DONOVAN
          My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.

                         INDY
          I know who you are Mr. Donovan.
          Your contributions to the museum
          over the years have been extremely
          generous. Some of the pieces in
          your collection here are very
          impressive.

                         DONOVAN
          Well, like yourself, Doctor Jones,
          I have a passion for antiquities.
                                  (beat)
          Have a look over here. This might
          interest you.


CONTINUED:

     DONOVAN goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth. He throws back
     the cloth revealing a flat STONE TABLET—about two feet square, inscribed with
     letters and symbols.

     INDY looks impressed. He puts on his glasses to make a closer examination.

                         INDY
          Well, it's sandstone. Christian
          symbol. Early Latin text. Mid-
          Twelfth Century, I should think.

                         DONOVAN
          That was our assessment as well.
     
                         INDY
          Where did this come from?

                         DONOVAN
          My engineers unearthed it in the
          mountain region north of Ankara
          while excavating for copper.
                  (beat)
          Can you translate the inscription?

     Translating the inscription is no easy matter, even for someone as knowledgeable
     as INDY.

                                           INDY
                  (stumbling through it)
          "... who drinks the water I shall
          give him, says the Lord, will have
          a spring inside him welling up
          for eternal life. Let them bring
          me to your holy mountain in the
          place where you dwell.

     Donovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses as Indy reads.

                         INDY
          Across the desert and through
          the mountain to the Canyon of
          the Crescent Moon, to the Temple
          where the cup that—"

     Suddenly INDY stops and looks up at DONOVAN with a startled expression.

                         INDY
          "Where the cup that holds the
          blood of Jesus Christ resides
          forever. "

                                                           (CONT'D)


CONTINUED: (2)

                  DONOVAN
                (reverently)
          The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones.
          The chalice used by Christ during
          the Last Supper. The cup that
          caught His blood at the Crucifixion
          and was entrusted to Joseph of
          Arimathaea.

     INDY rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the glass of champagne
     DONOVAN now offers him.

                         INDY
          The Arthur Legend. I've heard
          this bedtime story before.
     
                         DONOVAN
          Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The
          gift of youth to whoever drinks
          from the Grail.
                  (beat)
          Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd
          like to wake up to!

                         INDY
          An old man's dream.

                         DONOVAN
          Every man's dream.
                      (beat)
          Including your father's, I believe.

     INDY stiffens slightly at the mention of his father, nods.

                         INDY
          Grail lore is his hobby.
          He's a teacher of Medieval
          Literature. The one the students
          hope they don't get.

     The door opens and MRS. DONOVAN steps into the room. She's a matronly
     woman in an expensive evening gown.

                         MRS. DONOVAN
          Walter, you're neglecting our
          guests.

                         DONOVAN
          Be along in a moment, dear.

     He leans over and kisses her cheek. MRS. DONOVAN sighs to herself and returns
     to the party. INDY, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the Grail Tablet,
     obviously hooked by its archaeological promise. He moistens his finger with
     champagne and rubs it over the tablet. DONOVAN steps up next to Indy.

                         DONOVAN
          Hard to resist, isn't it? The
          Holy Grail's final resting place
          described in detail!

                         INDY
          What good is it? This Grail
          Tablet speaks of deserts and
          mountains and canyons. Pretty
          vague. Where do you start
          looking? Maybe if the Tablet were
          intact, you'd have something to
          go on. But the entire top
          portion is missing.

                         DONOVAN
          Just the same, an attempt to
          recover the Grail is currently
          underway.

     INDY has to shake his head at DONOVAN's apparent lack of judgment.

                         DONOVAN
          Let me tell you another "bedtime
          story, " Doctor Jones.
          After the Grail was entrusted
          to Joseph of Arimathaea, it
          disappeared and was lost for a
          thousand years before it was found
          again by three Knights of the
          First Crusade. Three brothers,
          to be exact.

                         INDY
          I've heard this one as well.
          Two of these brothers walked out
          of the desert one hundred and
          fifty years after having found
          the Grail and began the long
          journey back to France. But
          only one of them made it. And
          before dying of extreme old
          age, he supposedly imparted
          his tale to a—to a Franciscan
          friar, I think.

                         DONOVAN
          Not "supposedly," Doctor Jones.

     DONOVAN produces an ANCIENT LEATHER-BOUND VOLUME with very brittle
     pages. INDY views the manuscript with considerable interest.


CONTINUED: (4)

                         DONOVAN
          This is the manuscript in which
          the friar chronicled the Knight's
          story... it doesn't reveal on
          location of the Grail, I'm afraid...
          but the Knight promised that two
          "markers" that had been left
          behind would.
                 (indicates the Tablet)
          This Tablet is one of those
          "markers." It proves the Knight's
          story is true. But as you pointed
          out—it's incomplete.
                 (beat)
          Now, the second "marker" is
          entombed with the Knight's dead
          brother. Our project leader
          believes that tomb to be located
          within the city of Venice, Italy.
                 (beat)
          As you can now see, Doctor Jones,
          we're about to complete a great
          quest that began almost two
          thousand years ago. We're only
          one step away.

                         INDY
          That's usually when the ground
          falls out from underneath your
          feet.

                         DONOVAN
          You could be more right than you
          know.

                         INDY
          Yes?

                         DONOVAN
          We've hit a snag. our project
          leader has vanished. Along with
          all his research. Uh, we received
          a cable from his colleague, Doctor
          Schneider, who has no idea of his
          whereabouts or what's become of
          him.
                  (beat)
          I want you to pick up the trail
          where he left off. Find the man
          and you will find the Grail.


CONTINUED: (5)

                          INDY
          You've got the wrong Jones, Mister
          Donovan. Why don't you try my
          father?

               DONOVAN
                  (after a pause)
          We already have. Your father is
          the man who's disappeared.


     EXT. A RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

     A FORD COUPE speeds down the tree-lined street.

     EXT. PROFESSOR HENRY JONES' HOUSE - DAY

     The Ford coupe pulls up in front of the house. INDY climbs from the car and
     hurries up the walkway. BRODY is a step behind.

                          BRODY
          Your father and I have been
          friends since time began. I've
          watched you grow up, Indy. And
          I've watched the two of you grow
          apart.
                  (beat)
          I've never seen you this concerned
          about him before.

     They climb the porch and notice that the front door is ajar. They exchange a
     quick look of concern as they enter.

     INT. THE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

     INDY approaches the half-open front door.


                                INDY
                            Dad?
                                 (to BRODY)
          He's an academic A bookworm.
          He's not a field mans

     He pushes open the door. He enters the house and calls out.

                                         INDY
          Dad? Dad?
                                          
     INDY opens one half of the curtains dividing the hall from the sitting room.

     We see the place has been ransacked.


CONTINUED:

     BRODY sees INDY's face and opens the other half.

               BRODY
                             Dear God.

     They walk into the room.


                         BRODY
          What has the old fool got
          himself into now?

                         INDY
          I don't know. But whatever it
          is, he's in over his head!

     BRODY picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk.

               INDY
          Dad?              

                         BRODY
                 It's today's mail. And it's been
          opened.

     INDY turns and sees the pile of torn papers and envelopes. Then something hits
     him.

                         INDY
                 Mail! That's it, Marcus!

     He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from
     his college office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark.

               INDY
                (as he tears it open)
          Venice, Italy!

               BRODY
          What is it?


     INDY uncovers a small book. It looks like a JOURNAL or
     DIARY. Indy flips through it: Page after page of
     handwritten notes and drawings. BRODY glances at it with
     great curiosity.

                         INDY
          It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every
          clue he ever followed. Every
          discovery he made. A complete
          record of his search for the Holy
          Grail. This is his whole life.
          Why would he have sent this to me?


CONTINUED: (2)

                         BRODY
          I don't know. But someone must
          want it pretty badly.

                         INDY
          Do you believe, Marcus?

     As INDY asks the question, he turns to a PAINTING on the wall: A depiction of
     Christ on the Cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice.

     A SECOND PAINTING on the wall shows Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting
     to their deaths over a high cliff. One Crusader, however, floats safely in midair
     because he holds the Grail in his hands.

                         INDY
          Do you believe the Grail actually
          exists?

                         BRODY
          The search for the Cup of Christ
          is the search for the divine in all
          of us.

     BRODY sees that INDY is unsatisfied by this response.

                         BRODY
          But if you want facts, Indy, I
          have none to give you. At my age,
          I'm prepared to take a few things
          on faith.

                         INDY
          Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him
          I'll take that ticket to Venice
          now.

                         BRODY
          I'll tell him we'll take two.


     EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

     A LIMO is parked beside a PRIVATE AIRLINER that bears the DONOVAN
     CORPORATE LOGO. BRODY peers inside to DONOVAN and INDY.

                         BRODY
          Tell me, what's going to happen
          when we get to Venice?

               DONOVAN
                (overlapping)
          Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will
          be there to meet you.

CONTINUED:

               BRODY
                (overlapping)
          Schneider?

                         DONOVAN
               (overlapping)
          I maintain an apartment in Venice,
          at your disposal.

                              BRODY
          Oh, well. That's good. Thank
          you.

     BRODY and DONOVAN shake hands. INDY steps from the back seat of the limo.
     He turns back to Donovan and shakes his hand.

                         DONOVAN
          Doctor Jones. Good luck. Be
          very careful. Don't trust anvbody.


     INT. AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY
     
     INDY opens the Grail Diary and thoughtfully turns through the pages. He stops
     at one page and glances at a PENCIL SKETCH of what might be a stained-glass
     window. Below the sketch is a SERIES OF NUMBERS.


     EXT. THE PRIVATE AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY

     SUPERIMPOSED over a MAP that traces a course from New York City to Venice,
     Italy.

     DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. VENICE - BOAT LANDING - DAY

     INDY and BRODY disembark from the Water Bus onto the Boat Landing as other
     Gondoliers steer their boats in the water.

               INDY
           Ah, Venice...

                         BRODY
          Yes. Uh, how will we recognize
          this Doctor Schneider when we
          see him?

                         INDY
          I don't know. Maybe he'll know
          us.


CONTINUED:

     Suddenly a WOMAN comes up to him. Attractive features. Blonde hair. Eyes
     that are bright and intelligent.

               ELSA
          Doctor Jones?

               INDY
          Yes?

                         ELSA
          I knew it was you—

     She looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious.

                                           ELSA
                            —you have your father's eyes.

     INDY is instantly attracted to her.

                         INDY
          And my mother's ears. But the
          rest belongs to you.

                         ELSA
          Looks like the best parts have
          already been spoken for.

     INDY grins, enjoying the repartee. The WOMAN turns to BRODY, who tips his hat.

                         ELSA
          Marcus Brody?

                         BRODY
          That's right.

     The Woman, DR. ELSA SCHNEIDER, extends her hand to BRODY.

               ELSA
                  (introducing herself)
          Doctor Elsa Schneider.

     INDY's grin fades. BRODY registers a look of surprise.

                         BRODY
          Uh... how do you do?

                         CUT TO:


     EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

     INDY, BRODY and ELSA walk along the narrow canal, lined with buildings on
     either side.


CONTINUED:

                         ELSA
          The last time I saw your father
          we were in the library. He was
          very close to tracking down the
          Knight's Tomb. I've never seen
          him so excited. He was as giddy
          as a schoolboy.

                         INDY
          Who? Attila the Professor? He
          was never giddy, even when he was
          a schoolboy!

     INDY can't take his eyes off ELSA. Perhaps he's feeling a bit like a schoolboy
     himself right now. As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal,
     Indy steals a flower from a street vendor. He holds it out to Elsa.

                         INDY
          Fraulein—will you permit me?

                         ELSA
          I usually don't.

                         INDY
          I usually don't either.

                         ELSA
          In that case, I permit you.

     INDY gives her the flower.

                         INDY
          It would make me very happy.

                         ELSA
          But I'm already sad—by tomorrow
          it will have faded.

                         INDY
          Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

                         BRODY
                  (cutting in)
          I hate to interrupt you—but the
          reason we're here—

               ELSA
                  (interrupting)
          Yes. I have something to show
          you.

     She hands a slip of paper to INDY.


CONTINUED: (2)

                         ELSA
          I left your father working in
          the library. He sent me to the
          map section to fetch an ancient
          plan of the city. When I got back
          to his table—he'd gone—with
          all his papers—except for that
          scrap which I found near his chair.

     INDY extends the scrap of paper to BRODY.

                         INDY
          Roman numerals.


     EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - DAY

     ELSA leads INDY and BRODY into the large piazza. People walk about and sit at
     tables in front of a large building.

                         ELSA
          Here is the library.

     They have arrived at the front steps of the library.

                         INDY
          That doesn't look much like a
          library.

                         BRODY
          It looks like a converted church.

     ELSA leads the way inside.


     INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

     INDY, BRODY and ELSA enter, their heels CLICKING across the marble floor.

     We notice, along with INDY and BRODY, that the library contains many stained-
     glass windows.

                         ELSA
          In this case it's the literal
          truth. We're on holy ground.
          These columns over here...

     She indicates FOUR HUGE MARBLE COLUMNS that go from floor to ceiling.

                         ELSA
          ... were brought back as spoils
          of war after the sacking of
          Byzantium during the Crusades.


CONTINUED:

     INDY glances at the Columns, then notices a Stained-Glass Window that depicts a
     Knight of the Crusades. Indy lingers for a moment in front of the window.

                         ELSA
          Now please excuse me. The library's
          closing in a few moments. I'll
          arrange for us to stay a little
          longer.

     The minute ELSA is out of earshot.

                         INDY
          Marcus—I've seen this window
          before.

               BRODY
          Where?

     INDY whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the
     airplane.

                         INDY
          Right here. In Dad's Diary.
          You see?

     BRODY glances at the Diary, then at the window—noticing that the Roman
     numerals in question have been worked into the window's design.

                                          BRODY
          Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!

                         INDY
          Dad was onto something here!

                         BRODY
          Well, now we know the source of
          the numbers, but we still don't
          know what they mean.

     INDY and BRODY now see ELSA approaching. Indy quickly tucks the Diary back
     into his pocket.

                         INDY
                (explaining to Brody)
          My dad sent me this Diary for a
          reason. Until we find out why,
          I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

                         ELSA
          Find something?

     INDY doesn't reply. He's looking in five directions at once. His eyes moving
     across the walls and ceilings—charged with the thrill of discovery.


CONTINUED: (2)

                         BRODY
                  (to ELSA)
          Uh, yes. Three, seven and tent
          That window seems to be the source
          of the Roman numerals.

                         ELSA
          My God, I must be blind

                         INDY
          Dad wasn't looking for a book
          about the Knight's Tomb... he was
          looking for the Tomb itself

     ELSA wears a blank expression.

                         INDY
          Don't you get it? The Tomb is
          somewhere in the library! You
          said yourself it used to be a
          church! Look.

     INDY's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns.

               INDY
          Three.

INDY looks again to the stained-glass window. He points.

                         INDY
          Three!

     INDY has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral. Indy
     hurries away toward Column VII. All BRODY and ELSA can do now is try to keep
     up with him.

                        INDY
          Seven.

     He points again to the stained-glass window.

               INDY
          Seven... Ten.

     He looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands.

                         INDY
          And ten. Now where's the ten?
          Look around for the ten.

     INDY walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, then looks down.


CONTINUED: (3)

               INDY
          Three, seven and ten.
     
     He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a LOFT and looks down at BRODY and
     ELSA. The floor beneath their feet is an elaborate tile design containing a huge
     "X"—visible only from this higher angle.

               INDY
          Ten.
                (wryly; to himself)
          "X" marks the spot.

     INDY rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE where the two
     sides of the X intersect. He blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up,
     but cannot.

     INDY rushes past BRODY to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath
     the stained-glass window.

     INDY raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the
     Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian regards the stamper curiously.
     
     INDY continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes his stamping, still
     puzzled by the SOUND ECHOING through the library.

     Finally INDY breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a
     TWO-FOOT SQUARE HOLE IS REVEALED.

     Cold air and a wet, rancid smell escape from the hole.

               INDY
          Bingo.

               ELSA
          You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones.
          You're a great deal like your
          father.

               INDY
          Except he's lost, and I'm not.

               ELSA
          Lower me down.

     INDY is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeably—holding her by
     the hands and lowering her into the hole. When her feet finally touch ground
     below, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to BRODY.
     
               INDY
          Look after this for me, will you?

     Then INDY disappears into the hole.

     INT. CATACOMBS BELOW LIBRARY - DAY

     INDY jumps down a steep step. He reaches back to help ELSA.

               INDY
          Come on.

     INDY and ELSA glance around. This is really a horrid place. Dark and dank.
     foul smelling. Elsa turns. She removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory
     four-leaf clover design.

     INDY and ELSA inspect markings carved onto the walls.

                         ELSA
          Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth
          Century.

                         INDY
          Right. Six hundred years before
          the Crusades.

                         ELSA
          The Christians would have dug
          their own passages and burial
          chambers centuries later.

     INDY takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway.

                         INDY
          That's right. If there's a
          Knight of the First Crusade
          entombed down here, that's where
          we'll find him.


     INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     THREE MEN carrying guns make their way down the spiral staircase toward an
     unsuspecting BRODY. One of the Men, KAZIM, raises his gun and brings it down
     hard on Brody's head.

                         BRODY
          Ohhhh. . .

     KAZIM gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious BRODY. The other two
     men take Brody's hands and drag him into one of the book-lined aisles.

     INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS - DAY

     DECOMPOSING CORPSES rest in niches carved into the stone walls. Grotesque
     skeletal remains with rotting linen stretched across blackened bones.

     INDY holds the lighter up as he and ELSA inspect symbols carved into the walls.


CONTINUED:

     ELSA spots a symbol cut into the wall that she doesn't recognize. As she blows
     away some cobwebs:

                         ELSA
          What's this one?

     INDY only has to give it a quick glance to know.

                         INDY
          The Ark of the Covenant.

               ELSA
          Are you sure?

               INDY
                (deadpan)
          Pretty sure.

     INDY holds the lighter up and he and ELSA enter another dark passageway.

     ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

     INDY steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone. He scrapes the cobwebs
     away to reveal the ROMAN NUMERAL "X."

               INDY
          Watch out.

     ELSA now holds the lighter as INDY rams his shoulder into the wall. The wall
     collapses on impact and Indy falls through into another room.


     ANOTHER ROOM - THE CATACOMBS

     as INDY falls through the hole in the wall onto rocks surrounded by bubbling,
     green, slimy liquid. More skeletons surround him, resting in their carved niches.
     ELSA holds the lighter as she peers in at him through the hole in the wall.

                         INDY
          Petroleum. I could sink a well
          down here and retire.

     INDY reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which
     breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick water.

     INDY uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then
     dips into the oily water.

                         INDY
          Give me the lighter.

     ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

     Using the cloth-wrapped bone torch to guide their way, INDY and ELSA come
     upon a NARROW PASSAGEWAY. The water is knee-deep and TEEMING WITH
     RATS. Thousands of them Crawling on one another's backs. SQUEALING.
     Squirming. Thrashing in the water.

               INDY
          Oh, rats...

     ELSA gasps as the rats scamper between her legs.

     INDY moves forward through the rat-infested water as ELSA follows, still gasping
     in horror. Suddenly he slips into a hole. Recovering his balance, he reaches out
     to Elsa.

                        INDY
          Come onl

     She gasps once again, terrified. INDY lifts her and carries ELSA as he moves
     forward.


     THE CATACOMBS - THE HOLE IN THE WALL

     KAZIM and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their
     flashlights through to the rat-infested water.

     ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

     More rat-infested water as ELSA, now walking again, follows INDY through
     another passageway lined with skulls and bones.

     INDY reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton. A
     bone comes loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all
     directions.

     He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to ELSA's
     side. He steps into the water, then reaches up to help Elsa do the same.

               INDY
          Come here.

     LARGE BURIAL CHAMBER

     The chamber is flooded with black, briny water.
               
               INDY
          Look. . .

     In the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is what amounts to an
     "island altar" on which SEVERAL ANCIENT COFFINS rest. They move toward the
     altar.


CONTINUED:

     INDY and ELSA begin to inspect the ornately carved COFFINS like the scholars of
     antiquity that they are. These are big oak caskets held together by straps of
     etched brass.

                       INDY
          It must be one of these...

                       ELSA
          Look at the artistry of these
          carvings and the scrollwork.

     One coffin is elevated above the others.

                       ELSA
          It's this one.

     Together they begin to push on the lid—STRAINING and GROANING until it
     slides away and BANGS against the stone platform.


     INSIDE THE COFFIN

     lie the DECOMPOSED REMAINS of a KNIGHT IN ARMOR. INDY and ELSA look
     in...Elsa gasps.

                         INDY
          This is itl we found it! Look—
          the engraving on the Shield. It's
          the same as on the Grail Tablets
          The Shield is the Second Marker!

     INDY unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield.

               ELSA
          What's that?

                         INDY
          It's a rubbing Dad made of the
          Grail Tablet.

     The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield.

                         ELSA
          Just like your father—giddy
          as a schoolboy.

     INDY laughs.

                         ELSA
          Wouldn't it be wonderful if he
          were here now to see this?

                         INDY
                 (chuckles)
          He never would have made it past
          the rats!  He hates rats!  He's
          scared to death of them!

     CLOSE - A HAND

     as it lights a match.

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL KAZIM dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick
     water.


     INDY AND ELSA

     ELSA holds the torch. INDY looks around. Listens. Something is wrong. And
     then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing across the Catacomb walls.

     This is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around the corner of the
     Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward ELSA and INDY—SHRIEKING and
     SQUEALING as they approach.

     The rats literally wash over them—like a rodent tidal wave—in their efforts to
     escape a:

     HUGE ORANGE BALL OF FIRE

     ROARING around the corner hurtling towards them—feeding on the oil slick;
     consuming the oxygen.

     ELSA SCREAMS.

                                          INDY
          Get back! Back against the wall.

     INDY braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN with his feet.
     It CRASHES against the stone platform and SPLASHES into the water.

                                          INDY
          Quick! Under it!

     They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin.

                                          INDY
          Air pocket!

     ELSA hesitates. INDY literally DUNKS her and pushes her underneath.


     UNDER THE COFFIN

     ELSA surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, SPUTTERING and
     SPITTING.

     Now INDY pops up into the air pocket. He looks at ELSA—they are both soaking
     wet.

                          INDY
          Don't wander off.


CONTINUED:

               ELSA
          What?

     INDY disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin.

               ELSA
          What?

     UNDER THE WATER

     INDY swims, looking for an escape route.

     UNDER THE COFFIN

     The rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water
     and climbing on ELSA, who squirms and screams in terror.

     INDY pops back up through the water.

               INDY
          I think I've found a way out.
          Deep breath.

     ELSA groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water.


     EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY

     The perfect picture postcard—St. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond.
     Cafe customers are startled to see INDY and ELSA climb out of the sewer, wet
     and smelly. Indy looks around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles.

                                 INDY
                     (wryly)
          Ah, Venicel

     Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since KAZIM and TWO OTHER TURKISH
     AGENTS are running towards them with drawn guns.

     He grabs ELSA by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and LEAP
     INTO A MOTORBOAT.


     INT. THE MOTORBOAT - DAY

     INDY fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock... but not before a
     Turkish Agent JUMPS in with him.

     ELSA grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while INDY and the Turk trade
     punches.

     EXT. THE HARBOR - DAY

     Indy's Speedboat BOUNCES across the choppy waters heading in the direction of
     the DOCKED STEAMSHIP.

     KAZIM and his men rush to TWO MORE SPEEDBOATS tied to the dock.

     They chase after INDY.

     INDY grapples with the Turkish Agent. As Indy grips his arms, we SEE a GUN in
     the Agent's hand. It FIRES.

     As INDY fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the Speedboats behind him
     and two enormous Freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes.

     INDY, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish Agent.

               INDY
                (to ELSA)
          Are you crazy?! You don't go
          between them!

     ELSA can barely hear INDY over the noise of the motor.

                                           ELSA
          Go between them? Are you crazy?!

     INDY finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish Agent flying overboard.
     Turning, Indy sees that ELSA has committed the speedboat to a course BETWEEN
     the two Freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat.

               INDY
          I said go around!

               ELSA
          You said go between them!

               INDY
          I said don't go between them!

     It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the the two Freighters loom
     up on either side of them like cavern walls.


     EXT. FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR - DAY

     One Enemy Speedboat chases INDY between the two Freighters. But the Speedboat
     containing KAZIM veers off and goes around.


     EXT. BETWEEN THE TWO FREIGHTERS - DAY

     It's a race for daylight as the two Freighters drift ever closer to one another.

     Indy's Speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap. But the Enemy
     Speedboat EXPLODES as it is crushed between the two Freighters, FLYING INTO
     THE AIR and SPLASHING back down into the water.

     INDY AND ELSA

     spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT appear
     racing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, FIRING A MACHINE GUN at
     INDY and ELSA.


     KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT
     
     matches Indy's move for move.

     FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR

     The two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A CHATTERING
     MACHINE GUN from Kazim's boat SPLINTERS the wood of Indy's boat, until
     finally the rear of the boat CATCHES ON FIRE.

     The machine gun runs out of ammunition. KAZIM puts it down and takes control
     of the wheel from one of the Turkish Agents in the boat with him.

     As Indy's boat drifts toward the GIANT, TURNING PROPELLERS at the STERN of
     ANOTHER STEAMER, Kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them. INDY
     steps into Kazim's boat. He knocks one of the Turkish Agents to the deck, then
     turns his attention to KAZIM. The two men trade punches as the boat spins
     helplessly in the churning water.

               ELSA
          No!!

     INDY kicks KAZIM in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back
     into the boat, now being SUCKED THROUGH THE CHURNING WATER toward the
     Steamer's giant propeller blades.

                         INDY
          Why are you trying to kill us?

                         KAZIM
          Because you're looking for the
          Holy Grail.

                         INDY
          My father was looking for the
          Holy Grail. Did you kill him
          too?

               KAZIM
          No.

                         INDY
          Where is he? Talk—or you're
          dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell
          me!

               KAZIM
          If you don't let go, Doctor Jones,
          we'll both die.


CONTINUED:

                         INDY
          Then we'll die.

                         KAZIM
          My soul is prepared. How's yours?

     By now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are
     getting closer.

                         INDY
          This is your last chance.

                         KAZIM
          No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!

     The wind of the blades is on their necks. INDY grabs KAZIM just in time and
     jumps... into the motorboat, driven by ELSA, which gets alongside in the nick of
     time.

               INDY
          All right! Where's my father

                         KAZIM
          If you let me go, I will tell you
          where he is.

                         INDY
          Who are you?

                         KAZIM
          My name is Kazim.

                         INDY
          And why were you trying to kill
          me?

                         KAZIM
          The secret of the Grail has been
          safe for a thousand years. And
          for all that time the Brotherhood
          of the Cruciform Sword has been
          prepared to do anything to keep
          it safe.

     KAZIM pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark... or is it a tattoo? Whatever it
     is, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of
     a broadsword.

                         KAZIM
          Let me get off at this jetty.

     The boat is close to the edge of the canal. INDY gives ELSA a nod, telling her to
     bring the boat in. KAZIM steps ashore.


CONTINUED: (2)

                         KAZIM
          Ask yourself, why do you seek
          the Cup of Christ? Is it for His
          glory, or for yours?

                         INDY
          I didn't come for the Cup of
          Christ. I came to find my father.

                         KAZIM
          In that case, God be with you in
          your quest. Your father is being
          held in the Castle of Brunwald on
          the Austrian-German border.

     KAZIM walks away.

     INT. VENICE APARTMENT - DAY

     CLOSE ON THE WATER-SOAKED PAPER IMPRESSION: The rubbing taken from
     the shield of the Grail Knight.

     BRODY is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head
     with an ice pack.

                         INDY
          How's the head?

               BRODY
          It's better, now I've seen this.
          It's the name of a city.
          "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...

     INDY, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression.

                         INDY
          The Knights of the First Crusade
          laid siege to the city of
          Alexandretta for over a year.
          The entire city was destroyed.

     BRODY lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at INDY.

                         INDY
          The present city of Iskenderun
          is built on its ruins. Marcus—
          you remember what the Grail
          Tablet said. "Across the desert
          and through the mountain to the
          Canyon of the Crescent Moon."
                 (pause)
          But where exactly?


CONTINUED:

                         BRODY
          Your father would know. Your
          father did know. Look. He
          made a map.

     BRODY picks up the Grail Diary.

                         BRODY
          He must have pieced it together
          from clues scattered through the
          whole history of the Grail Quest.
          A map with no names.


     INSERT: A PENCIL-DRAWN MAP

     It covers two pages of the Diary. BRODY's finger moves across it.

                         BRODY
          Now, he knew there was a city
          with an oasis due east. Here.
          He knew the course turned south
          through the desert to a river, and
          the river led into the mountains.
          Here. Straight to the canyon.
          He knew everything except where
          to begin, the name of the city.

               INDY
                (solemnly)
          Alexandretta. Now we know.

                         BRODY
          Yes. Now we know.

               INDY
                (rising)
          Marcus, get hold of Sallah. Tell
          him to meet you in Iskenderun.

     INDY closes the Grail Diary and puts it into the pocket of his robe.

                         BRODY
          What about you?

                         INDY
          I'm going after Dad.


     INT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY

     INDY opens the door. His bedroom has been ransacked...the mattress on the
     floor, the drawers turned out.

     INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     INDY approaches another door (Elsa's bedroom) and knocks.

                         INDY
          Elsa?

     He goes in.


     INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

     ... and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own. The
     room is empty.

     He is worried for her, knocks and calls out:

                         INDY
          Elsa?

     He steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door.
     
                         INDY
          Elsa?

     He opens the bathroom door, peering inside.

                         INDY
          Elsa?


     INT. ELSA'S BATHROOM - DAY
     
     Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe. She gasps, startled, as
     INDY enters. He retreats back into her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a
     record player sitting on a ledge above the bathtub.


     INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

     ELSA joins INDY, waiting in the ransacked room. she looks around in shock.

                                            ELSA
                                         My room!

               INDY          
          Mine, too.

               ELSA
          What were they looking for?

     She looks to INDY, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket.

               INDY
          This.


CONTINUED:

                         ELSA
          The Grail Diary.

                         INDY
          Uh-huh.

                         ELSA
          You had it? You didn't trust
          me!

     She looks hurt and beautiful. She comes closer to him.

                         INDY
          I didn't know you.

     She's awfully hard to resist.

                         INDY
          At least I let you tag along.

                         ELSA
          Oh, yes. Give them a flower and
          they'll follow you anywhere.

                         INDY
          Knock it off. You're not mad.

               ELSA
          No?

                          INDY
          No. You like the way I do things.

                         ELSA
          It's lucky I don't do things the
          same way. You'd still be standing
          at the Venice pier.

     She stomps her foot angrily. INDY flinches. She starts to walk away but Indy
     grabs her.

                         INDY
          Look, what do you think is going
          on here? Since I've met you,
          I've nearly been incinerated,
          drowned, shot at, and chopped into
          fish bait. We're caught in the
          middle of something sinister here.
          My guess is Dad found out more
          than he was looking for. And
          until I'm sure, I'm going to
          continue to do things the way I
          think they should be done.


CONTINUED: (2)

     He pulls her to him and kisses her.

                          ELSA
          How dare you kiss me!

     Now ELSA reaches for INDY and kisses him.

                          INDY
          Leave me alone. I don't like
          fast women.

     But he embraces her, and ELSA begins to nibble at his ear.

                          ELSA
          And I hate arrogant men.

     INDY smiles slyly as they fall to the bed.


     EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

     A GONDOLIER SINGS as he steers his gondola carrying two passengers past
     Indy's window.


     INT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY

     INDY lies on top of ELSA, kissing her. He stops for a moment as he hears the
     GONDOLIER SINGING.

                          INDY
          Ahh, Venice.

     ELSA reaches up and pulls him back down to her.


     EXT. ROAD THROUGH THE AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

     A Mercedes-Benz glides through the sharp mountain curves. This is
     SUPERIMPOSED OVER A MAP that charts their course from Venice across Austria
     toward Salzburg.


     EXT. CASTLE IN THE AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

     Storm clouds darken the skies. THUNDER EXPLODES in the
     distance; lightning flashes. The Mercedes-Benz drives into the courtyard of the
     formidable stone castle.

                          INDY
          What do you know about this
          place?

                          ELSA
          I know the Brunwalds are famous
          art collectors.

     INT. MERCEDES-BENZ - DAY

     INDY reaches into the back seat and retrieves his bullwhip.

               ELSA
          What are you going to do?

               INDY
          Don't know. Think of something.

     He glances up to the beret ELSA is wearing. She reaches up and adjusts it.


     INT. CASTLE ENTRANCE HALL - DAY

     A BUTLER walks to the door and opens it to reveal INDY and ELSA standing
     outside in the rain. she now wears Indy's fedora; Indy is wearing Elsa's beret.

               BUTLER
          Yes?

     INDY, followed by ELSA, steps inside, shaking the water from his overcoat. He
     adopts a Scottish accent.

                         INDY
          And not before time! Did you
          intend to leave us standing on
          the doorstep all day? We're
          drenched!

     As INDY says this he pushes his way past the startled BUTLER, pulling a
     handkerchief from the man's pocket. ELSA follows, taking off her coat. INDY
     SNEEZES HARD.

                         INDY
          Now look! I've gone and caught
          a sniffle.

     INDY dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as ELSA looks on in amused
     amazement.

               BUTLER
                (coldly; with
                 Austrian accent)
          Are you expected?

                         INDY
          Don't take that tone with me, my
          good man. Now buttle off and tell
          Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence
          MacDonald and his lovely assistant
          are here to view the tapestries.


                                                           (CONT'D)

CONTINUED:
               BUTLER
          Tapestries?

                         INDY
          Dear me, the man is dense. This
          is a castle, isn't it? There are
          tapestries?

                         BUTLER
          This is a castle. And we have
          many tapestries. But if you're a
          Scottish lord, then I am Mickey
          Mouse.

                         INDY
          How dare he?!

     Simultaneously knocking the BUTLER cold with one slug on the jaw. The Butler
     falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, out cold.


     INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

     INDY and ELSA move cautiously and quietly down the wide, vaulted hallway.
     APPROACHING VOICES ARE HEARD. Indy and Elsa creep past a room full of
     NAZI SOLDIERS working around a large table with a map atop it..

     INDY reacts to the sight of them.

               INDY
                  (to ELSA; softly)
          Nazis. I hate these guys.

     INDY and ELSA continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun in his hand and
     his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens.

                         INDY
          This one. I think he's in here.

               ELSA
          How do you know?

     INDY points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE.

                         INDY
          Because it's wired.

     He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter one of the other
     doors. He knocks at the door—there is no response. He looks back at ELSA and
     enters.

INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

     The room is dark and empty. INDY throws open the window shutters and looks
     out. RAIN comes down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each window—
     but below that is a SHEER DROP. Indy wants to get out onto the window ledge,
     which is several yards away.

               ELSA
          Indy? Indy?

     INDY reassures her.


                         INDY
          Don't worry... this is kid's play.
          I'll be right back.

     He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude
     from the castle wall above the next window.

     He gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will hold his weight.


     EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY

     INDY SWINGS from the window to the stone gargoyle.

     CLOSE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE

     A PAIR OF WOODEN SHUTTERS seals the window.

     INDY takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet...
     swings toward the shuttered window with his feet extended... CRASHING
     THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS as a CLAP OF THUNDER disguises the noise.


     INT. THE ROOM - DAY

     INDY CRASHES THROUGH SHUTTERS AND GLASS into the room. The broken
     shutters hang by their hinges. Rain and cold air whip through the open window.

     No sooner does Indy get to his feet, than a VASE COMES CRASHING DOWN ON
     THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

     Stunned, INDY sinks to one knee... and Indy's father, PROFESSOR HENRY JONES,
     steps out of the shadows.

               HENRY
          Junior?

     INDY gets to his feet.

               INDY
                (a reflex)
          Yes, sirl

CONTINUED:

     This reply is a kneejerk reaction on Indy's part. Now they look at each other.

               HENRY
          It is you Junior!

               INDY
               (an old familiar
                irritation)
          Don't call me that, please.

               HENRY
               (amazed)
          But what are you doing here?

               INDY
          I came to get you! What do you
          think? 

     NAZI VOICES ARE HEARD approaching. INDY and HENRY press themselves
     against the wall, Henry still holding the broken vase in his hand.

     INDY steps to the window and looks down. HENRY moves to a lamp, holding the
     vase under the light for a closer look.

               HENRY
                 (sotto, mumbled)
          Late Fourteenth Century, Ming
          Dynasty.

     HENRY is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand. Father and
     son get onto crossed lines for a couple of moments.

               HENRY
          Oh, it breaks the heart.

                           INDY
              (quietly to himself)
          And the head.
              (to HENRY, aggrievedly)
          You hit me, Dad!

               HENRY
               (referring to the
                vase)
          I'll never forgive myself—

               INDY
                 (surprised,
                  misunderstanding)
          Don't worry—I'm fine.

               HENRY
          Thank God!


CONTINUED: (2)

     HENRY has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase... he is examining the
     broken end carefully.

                         HENRY
          ... it's fake. See, you can tell
          by the cross section.

     HENRY throws the vase against the wall where it SHATTERS.

                         INDY
          No! Dad, get your stuff. We've
          got to get out of here.

                         HENRY
          Well, I am sorry about your head,
          though. But I thought you were
          one of them.

                         INDY
          Dad, they come in through the
          doors.

               HENRY
                (laughs)
          Good point.

     INDY steps to the door and stands, listening.

               HENRY
          But better safe than sorry.

     HENRY slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag.

                         HENRY
          Humpf—so I was wrong this time.
          But by God, I wasn't wrong when I
          mailed you my Diary. You obviously
          got it.

                         INDY
          I got it and I used it. We found
          the entrance to the catacombs.

               HENRY
               (excited)
          Through the library?

                         INDY
          Right.

                         HENRY
          I knew it. And the tomb of Sir
          Richard?


CONTINUED: (3)

     INDY nods.

                         INDY
          Found it.

               HENRY
               (breathless)
          He was actually there? You saw
          him?


                         INDY
          Well, what was left of him.

               HENRY
                (trembling with
                 anticipation)
          And his shield... the inscription
          on Sir Richard's shield...?

                         INDY
          Alexandretta.
              (beat)

     It's a great moment in HENRY's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a
     moment, then turns to INDY with joy.

                         HENRY
          Alexandretta... of course... on
          the pilgrim trail from the Eastern
          Empire. Oh, Junior...

     INDY winces, and would interrupt but suddenly it's not the moment.

               HENRY
          ... you did it.


                         INDY
          No, Dad. You did. Forty years.

                         HENRY
          If only I could have been with
          you.

               INDY
          There were rats, Dad.

               HENRY
          Rats?

               INDY
          Yeah. big ones. What do the
          Nazis want with you Dad?

               HENRY
          They want my diary.


CONTINUED: (4)

               INDY
               (interested)
          Yeah?

     INDY's interest is a moment which becomes important later but for now it passes.

                         HENRY
          I knew I had to get that book as
          far away from me as I possibly
          could.

     INDY's hand moves unconsciously to his pocket. His eyes turn inward.

                                           INDY
                (thoughtfully)
          Yeah. . .

     Then... BAMI The door is kicked open and three NAZIS enter. One is an S.S.
     OFFICER. The other two are SOLDIERS with machine guns. HENRY and INDY
     raise their hands.

               S.S. OFFICER
          Doctor Jones!!

               HENRY & INDY
          Yes!!


                         S.S. OFFICER
          I will take the book now.

               INDY/HENRY
                (simultaneously)
          What book?

               S.S. OFFICER
               (to INDY)
          You have the Diary in your pocket.

     HENRY laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the
     S.S. OFFICER.

                         HENRY
          You doltl Do you think that my
          son would be that stupid that
          he would bring my Diary all the
          way back here?

     At which point an awful thought strikes HENRY.

                         HENRY
          You didn't, did you?
              (a beat)
          You didn't bring it, did you?


CONTINUED: (5)

               INDY
          Well, uh...

               HENRY
          You did!!


               INDY
          Look, can we discuss this later?

               HENRY
          I should have mailed it to the
          Marx Brothers.

               INDY
                 (overlapping)
          Will you take it easy....!

               HENRY
          Take it easy?! Why do you think
          I sent it home in the first place?
                  (points towards
                  the NAZIS)
          So it wouldn't fall into their
          hands!!

               INDY
          I came here to save you.

               HENRY
          Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to
          save you, Junior??

     INDY's eyes blazes His nostrils flares He's so pissed off, he literally RIPS A
     MACHINE GUN from the hands of one of the startled soldiers... and for a moment
     we think he's going to use it on his dad.

               INDY
          I told you--

     He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three NAZIS to
     ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room.

               INDY
          --don't call me Junior!

     HENRY looks shocked and horrified.

               HENRY
          Look what you did!!

     Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead.

               HENRY
               (aghast)
          I can't believe what you just....

     INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

     INDY leads HENRY down the hallway as he searches for Elsa.

               INDY
          Elsa? Elsa?

     He opens a door and enters:

     INT. FIRST CASTLE ROOM - DAY


     INDY and HENRY rush back into the room where ELSA had been left, only to
     find: A Nazi COLONEL HOLDING ELSA HOSTAGE.

     His name is VOGEL: a vicious-looking, lantern jawed brute. One arm is wrapped
     around Elsa's waist, the other hand presses the muzzle of a LUGER behind her
     ear.

                         VOGEL
          That's far enough Put down the
          gun, Doctor Jones. Put down the
          gun or the Fraulein dies.

                         HENRY
          But she's one of them!

               ELSA
          Indy, please!

               HENRY
          She's a Nazi!

               INDY
          What?!

     INDY  is thrown. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at ELSA, then back to his
     father. Everyone is yelling at once:

               HENRY
          Trust me!


                         ELSA
          Indy, no!

                         VOGEL
          I will kill her!

                         HENRY
          Oh yeah? Go ahead!

                         INDY
          No! Don't Shoot!


CONTINUED:

               HENRY
                  (to Indy)
          Don't worry. He won't.

               ELSA
          Indy, please! Do what he says!

               HENRY
          And don't listen to her!

               VOGEL
          Enough! She diesl

     VOGEL jams the barrel of the luger painfully into ELSA's neck. Elsa SCREAMS.

               INDY
          Wait!  Waitl

     And then Indy gives in. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides
     across, SHATTERING GLASS. HENRY GROANS audibly.

     VOGEL releases his grip on ELSA and shoves her toward INDY. She is propelled
     directly into his arms. He holds her tightly. She buries her face in his chest.

                                          ELSA
          I'm sorry.

     INDY comforts her.

                                          INDY
          No, don't be.

     Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary.

                                          ELSA
          But you should have listened to
          your father.

     She steps back next to VOGEL. INDY is stunned. HENRY gives him his most
     withering look of reprimand.


     INT. BARONIAL ROOM - DAY

     A large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor.
     Firelight—from the giant fireplace—dances across the ceiling and walls.

     INDY and HENRY are ushered in, hands tied behind back, accompanied by VOGEL
     and ELSA and TWO NAZI GUARDS.

     ELSA crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the fireplace. INDY and
     HENRY do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair. They
     only see a HAND REACH OUT AND TAKE THE BOOK.


CONTINUED:

               INDY
                  (quietly to HENRY)
          She ransacked her own room and I
          fell for it. How did you know
          she was a Nazi?

                         HENRY
          Umh?

                         INDY
          How did you she was a Nazi?

                         HENRY
          She talks in her sleep.

     INDY nods, and then the statement catches up with him. He looks at HENRY
     with surprise.

                         HENRY
          I didn't trust her. Why did
          you?

                         MAN IN CHAIR
          Because he didn't take my advice.

     The MAN IN THE CHAIR gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be...
     WALTER DONOVAN. INDY and HENRY react with stunned expressions.

                         INDY
          Donovan
     
                         DONOVAN
          Didn't I warn you not to trust
          anybody, Doctor Jones?

     DONOVAN smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary.

                         HENRY
          I misjudged you Walter—I knew
          you'd sell your mother for an
          Etruscan vase.
          But I didn't know you'd sell your
          country and your soul to the slime
          of humanity.

                         DONOVAN
                  (suddenly erupting)
          Doctor Schneider There're pages
          torn out of thisl

     ELSA rushes to DONOVAN's side. she takes the Grail Diary from him. Elsa takes
     a look for herself—then glances up at Indy.


CONTINUED: (2)

                         ELSA
          This book contained a map—a
          map with no names—precise
          directions from the unknown city
          to the secret Canyon of the
          Crescent Moon.

               INDY
          So it did.


                         DONOVAN
          Where are these missing pages?
          This maps we must have these
          pages backs

     HENRY gives INDY a look of surprise. Indy smirks.

               ELSA
                  (to Donovan)
          You're wasting your breath. He
          won't tell us. And he doesn't
          have to... it's perfectly obvious
          where the pages are...
                  (looking at Indy)
          ... he's given them to Marcus
          Brody.

     HENRY now wears a pained expression.

               HENRY
                  (to Indy)
          Marcus?! You didn't drag poor
          Marcus along, did you? He's not
          up to the challenge.

                         DONOVAN
          He sticks out like a sore thumb.
          We'll find him.

                         INDY
          The hell you will. He's got a
          two-day head-start on you, which
          is more than he needs.
                  (beat)
          Brody's got friends in every town
          and village from here to the Sudan.
          He speaks a dozen languages, knows
          every local custom. He'll blend
          in. Disappear. You'll never see
          him again. With any luck, he's
          got the Grail already.

     HENRY looks amazed and impressed.

     EXT. TRAIN STATION - CITY OF ISKENDERUN - DAY

     BRODY disembarks from the train along with the other PASSENGERS, a cross-
     section of ARABS and TUSKS.

                         BRODY
          Does anyone here speak English?
          Or even ancient Greek?

     A Man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to BRODY.

                         BRODY
          No water, no thank you. No, fish
          make love in it.

     BRODY continues through the crowd past various STREET VENDORS. A Woman
     holds a chicken out to him.

                         BRODY
          Thank you so much. No, I don't
          like that. No, I really don't
          want... No, no, thank you very
          much. No, thank you, madam.
          I'm a vegetarian.


     The Woman walks away, leaving BRODY alone in the crowd.

                         BRODY
          Does anyone understand a word I'm
          saying here?

     SALLAH shoulders his way through the mob toward BRODY.

               SALLAH
          Mister Brodyl

     They meet and hug, then begin to walk.

               BRODY
          Oh, Sallahl What a relief!

               SALLAH
               (laughs)
          Marcus Brody, sir. And where is
          Indy?

               BRODY
               (overlapping)
          Oh, he's in Austria. A slight
          detour.

                         SALLAH
          You are on your own?

     A Woman runs in and tugs on BRODY's coat. He waves her away.


CONTINUED:

                         BRODY
          Yes, but don't panic. Everything's
          under control. Have you. . .have
          you arranged our supplies?

                         SALLAH
          Oh, yes, of course. But where
          are we going?

                         BRODY
          Oh, this map will show you. It
          was drawn by, uh...

     BRODY searches in his coat pocket for the map as a SINISTER MAN approaches.

               SINISTER MAN
          Mister Brody?

     BRODY puts the map back in his pocket. The SINISTER MAN clicks his heels and
     bows quickly.

                         SINISTER MAN
          Welcome to Iskenderun. The
          Director of the Museum of
          Antiquities has sent a car for
          you.

     BRODY takes off his hat.

                         BRODY
          Oh, what?... your servant, sir.

               SALLAH
          And I am his.


               SINISTER MAN
          Follow me, please.

     The man turns and joins a SECOND MAN. BRODY and SALLAH follow them.

                         BRODY
          My reputation precedes me.

               SALLAH
          There is no museum in Iskenderun.

     The SECOND MAN overhears SALLAH. He and his companion turn quickly.

               SECOND MAN
          Papers please.

                         SALLAH
          Papers?
               (laughs)
          Of course.


CONTINUED: (2)

     SALLAH puts Brody's luggage down and glances at BRODY.

               SALLAH
          Run.


     BRODY does not run. SALLAH pats his clothing, searching for his papers.

               BRODY
          Yes.

               SALLAH
          Papers, sir. Got it here.

     SALLAH laughs and pulls out a newspaper.

               SALLAH
          Just finished reading it myself.
                   (laughs; then, to
                    Brody)
          Run!

     BRODY looks confused. SALLAH shows the newspaper to the SECOND MAN.

               BRODY
          Yes.


                        SALLAH
          Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.
               (to Brody)
          Run!

                        BRODY
          Did you say...? Uh, uh...

     SALLAH puts the newspaper in front of the SECOND MAN's face, then punches
     him through the newspaper.

               SALLAH
          Run!


     The SECOND MAN falls, knocking over a vendor's stand. SALLAH and BRODY
     begin to run. SALLAH knocks the FIRST MAN into another vendor's stand. The
     STAND COLLAPSES on impact.

     SALLAH grabs BRODY and pulls him through the crowded streets.

               SALLAH
                  (to Brody; pointing)
          Okay, okay, quick, quick, quickl
          Hide in that doorl Hide in that
          door!

     SALLAH points to a DARKENED DOORWAY, hung with a curtain, at the top of a
     ramp. BRODY runs up the ramp, throws back the curtain and disappears into
     the darkness.


CONTINUED: (3)

     Then—METAL DOORS ARE SLAMMED behind Brody and we realize that he has
     actually run into the back of a Nazi TROOP TRUCK.

     SALLAH runs after the Truck until he reaches a wall, then leans against the wall
     dejectedly as the Truck drives away with BRODY inside.


     INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

     The room is dark. Ancient, floor-length drapes cover the windows. A HUGE
     FIREPLACE that's nearly large enough for a man to stand upright in dominates
     one wall.

     The NAZI GUARDS have tied INDY and HENRY back-to-back in a pair of chairs.
     ELSA and DONOVAN stand over them. VOGEL enters.

               HENRY
          Intolerable.


                         VOGEL
          Doctor Schneider. Message from
          Berlin. You must return immediately:
          a rally at the Institute of Aryan
          Culture.

                         ELSA
          So?

                         VOGEL
          Your presence on the platform is
          requested... at the highest level.

                         ELSA
          Thank you, Herr Oberst.
                (to DONOVAN)
          I will meet you at Iskenderun.

                         DONOVAN
          Take this Diary to the Reich
          Museum in Berlin. It will show
          them our progress, ahead of
          schedule. Without a map, I'm
          afraid it's no better than a
          souvenir.

     He hands her the Grail Diary.

               VOGEL
                   (to DONOVAN, meaning
                    Indy and Henry)
          Let me kill them now.


CONTINUED:

                         ELSA
          No. If we fail to recover the
          pages from Brody, we'll need them
          alive.

               DONOVAN
              (to VOGEL, with a
               helpless shrug)
          Always do what the doctor orders.

     DONOVAN leads VOGEL out. The NAZI GUARDS follow. Once they are gone,
     ELSA turns to INDY.

                         ELSA
          Don't look at me like that—we
          both wanted the Grail, I would
          have done anything to get it.
          You would have done the same.

     INDY shakes his head "no."

                         INDY
          I'm sorry you think so.

     She runs her hand down the side of his face. INDY pulls away.

     INDY and HENRY are still tied back-to-back of course. ELSA bends to speak
     quietly into INDY's ear... which is near enough to Henry's ear.

               ELSA
                (whispers)
          I can't forget... how wonderful
          it was.

                         HENRY
          Thank you. It was rather wonderful.

     She smiles and kisses INDY passionately. HENRY glances back and looks rather
     disappointed.

     VOGEL appears to remind ELSA of her appointment.

                         VOGEL
          Doctor Schneider! Your car is
          waiting.

               ELSA
               (to INDY, after
                finishing the kiss)
          That's how Austrians say goodbye.

     ELSA exits. VOGEL stays behind for another moment.


CONTINUED: (2)

                         VOGEL
          And this is how we say goodbye in
          Germany, Doctor Jones.

     VOGEL punches INDY in the jaw. A hard and vicious jab that snaps Indy's head
     around.

               HENRY
          Ohh. . .

     VOGEL exits. INDY shakes his head clear.

               INDY
                (to himself)
          Ooooh... I like the Austrian way
          better.

               HENRY
          So did I.

                         INDY
          Let's try and get these ropes
          loose. We've got to get to Marcus
          before the Nazis do!

               HENRY
               (confused)
          You said he had two days' start.
          That he would blend in. Disappear!

                         INDY
          Are you kidding?—I made that
          up! You know Marcus—he got
          lost once in his own museum!

     Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency.

                         INDY
          Can you try and reach into my
          left jacket pocket?

     HENRY is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket. INDY squirms his
     body around towards Henry's hand.

                         HENRY
          What am I looking for?
     
                         INDY
          My lucky charm.

                         HENRY
          Feels like a cigarette lighter.


CONTINUED: (3)

               INDY
          Try and burn through the ropes.

     HENRY's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame.

               HENRY
          Very good.

     HENRY yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops the lighter to the
     floor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to
     burn. INDY doesn't know it yet.

                         HENRY
          I ought to tell you something.

                         INDY
          Don't get sentimental now Dad—
          save it 'til we get out of here.

                         HENRY
          The floor's on fire! See?!

                         INDY
                  (turns and sees)
          What???

                         HENRY
          And the chair.

                         INDY
          All right, movel Move!  Rock
          your Chair.  Do what I do.

     They begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off the burning carpet.


     EXT. CASTLE - DAY

     as ELSA is driven away. VOGEL and DONOVAN remain behind, flanked by NAZI
     SOLDIERS .

     Another car pulls up and VOGEL holds the door open for DONOVAN who gets into
     the rear seat. A LIEUTENANT approaches with a written message for Donovan.

               LIEUTENANT
          Etwas wichtig, mein Herr.

     DONOVAN puts on his glasses to read the message.

                         DONOVAN
          Well, we have Marcus Brody. But
          more important, we have the map.

     A RADIO OPERATOR steps forward with yet another written message for
     DONOVAN.

                         RADIO OPERATOR
          Aus Berlin, mein Herr.

                         DONOVAN
                  (reading)
          "By the personal command of the
          Fuhrer. Secrecy essential to
          success. Eliminate the American
          conspirators."
                  (to VOGEL)
          Germany has declared war on the
          Jones boys.
                  (to DRIVER)
          Los fahren.

     The car drives off.

     INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

     INDY and HENRY are still in their chairs, tied back-to-back. Indy tries to
     communicate with Henry, but each time he calls him, the men turn their heads in
     opposite directions.

                         INDY
          Dad!

                         HENRY
          What?

                         INDY
          Dad!

                         HENRY
          What?

                         INDY
          Dad!

     Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.

               HENRY
          What?

               INDY
          Head for the fireplace!

               HENRY
          Oh.


     BANGING, ROCKING and HOPPING their chairs, they work their way INTO THE
     FIREPLACE—the only safe place from the now ROARING FIRE.

CONTINUED:

               INDY
          I think I can get these ropes
          off.

     Indy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal
     grill that operates a Secret Door.

               INDY
          Whoopsl

     The fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and his father find
     themselves in the:


     INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

     where a NAZI RADIOMAN wearing headphones sits at an elaborate panel of dials,
     switches and meters, and a WOMAN stands over a map plotting coordinates.
     Their backs are turned to INDY and HENRY.

     The floor begins to rotate again, and INDY and HENRY find themselves back in:


     INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

     inside the fireplace, still tied back-to-back.

               HENRY
          Our situation has not improved.

     INDY glances over his shoulder at HENRY.

               INDY
          Listen Dad... I'm almost free.

     INDY's foot hits the grill again... and the fireplace rotates to:


     INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

     FOUR NAZI RADIOMEN and the WOMAN are still hard at work with controls and
     coordinates. Suddenly the Woman looks up and spots HENRY and INDY. She
     screams.

               WOMAN
          Alarm!

     Now the RADIOMEN turn to see HENRY and INDY.

               WOMAN
          Schnel!!

     TWO NAZIS draw their revolvers and FIRE SEVERAL SHOTS at INDY and HENRY

     INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAWN

     INDY and HENRY rotate into the room which is now an INFERNO. The carpet,
     drapes and furniture are all ablaze.

                         HENRY
          This is intolerable!

               INDY
          I'm out, Dad!


     INDY finally breaks free. And he immediately begins to untie his father.

               HENRY
          Well done, boy!

     INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

     All FOUR RADIOMEN now have their guns drawn. They activate the lever and
     begin to rotate through the Secret Door.


     INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

     The RADIOMEN appear in the fireplace on the other side—but there is NO SIGN
     OF INDY AND HENRY.

     The RADIOMEN move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one
     hand, holding their guns with the other. Is it possible that INDY and HENRY
     escaped through these flames?

     Not a chance.

     They've hidden themselves UP THE CHIMNEY. And now they DROP DOWN,
     BEHIND the RADIOMEN.

     One of the RADIOMEN grabs INDY by the neck. As they struggle they fall against
     the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened HENRY
     behind.

     HENRY presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he disappears into the
     next room, a DEAD NAZI RADIOMAN swivels into the room. The other NAZIS
     rush forward to him.

     INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

     INDY picks up a BUST OF HITLER and uses it to jam the rotating wall in place,
     sealing the NAZIS inside the burning room.


     INT. CASTLE HALLWAY- DAY

     Vogel strides purposefully down the hallway. He BARKS an order, and TWO
     MORE NAZIS fall into step with him.

     INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

     INDY grabs his whip, his leather sack and Henry's case from a table. He hands
     the case to HENRY and they begin to run.

               INDY
          Come on Dad.

     INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY

     INDY and HENRY step into an empty room.

               INDY
          Dead end.

     HENRY looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as INDY searches
     frantically for an exit.

                         INDY
          There's got to be a... a secret
          door around. A passageway or
          something.

     INDY begins to run his hands over the walls—frantic.

                         HENRY
          I find that if I just sit down
          and think...

     HENRY sits on a chair which tips back, hitting the wall behind it. The floor at
     INDY's feet suddenly begins DROPPING AWAYI

     INDY grabs a railing to keep from falling, but loses his grip and plunges through
     the opening which has formed a SPIRAL STAIRCASE. He rolls down the stairs.

               INDY
          Dad! 

               HENRY
                        ... the solution presents itself.

     HENRY follows INDY down the staircase.


     INT. CAVERN/UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY

     The stairway deposits Indy and Henry into an enormous WATERY CAVERN
     beneath the mountain on which the castle was built.

     A full-scale Nazi BOAT DOCK has been built inside the cavern. We see
     MOTORBOATS, GUNBOATS, SUPPLY BOATS, etc.

                            INDY
          Great. More boats.


CONTINUED:

     INDY boards one of the motorboats and STARTS THE MOTOR.

                         HENRY
          Would you say this has been just
          another typical day for you? Huh?

     HENRY tosses his case at INDY who catches it and angrily throws it back to his
     father.

               INDY
                  (ironically)
          Ooofl No! It's been better than
          most.

     INDY moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away. HENRY looks confused.

               INDY
          Come on, Dad. Come onl

                         HENRY
          What about the boat? We're not
          going on the boat?


     INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY

     VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS enter the room and spot the spiral staircase
     leading below. They quickly descend the stairs.


     INT. CAVERN/UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY

     as VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS rush to the dock. Vogel sees that a motorboat
     is missing. He orders the Nazi Soldiers into a boat.

                         VOGEL
          Sie alle ins Boat. Schnell!

     CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a large box which suddenly BREAKS APART
     as INDY, now on a motorbike with HENRY in the sidecar, ROARS PAST THE
     DOCK, hitting TWO NAZI SOLDIERS who scream as they fall into the river.

     VOGEL screams after INDY and HENRY as they drive off.

     STRAIGHT CUT TO:

     EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

     INDY looks pleased as he drives the motorbike along the road, but HENRY
     appears worried.

                                          INDY
          Ha!

     FOUR NAZI SOLDIERS ON MOTORCYCLES

     They chase down the road after INDY and HENRY.

     INDY turns the motorbike down a smaller, dusty tree-lined road. HENRY gasps
     as he is jostled about in the sidecar. One of the NAZI SOLDIERS gives chase along
     a higher road running in the same direction.


     EXT. ROAD BARRICADE - DAY

     INDY approaches the barricade from one direction as one of the NAZI SOLDIERS
     approaches from a higher road.

     A GUARD steps from the road station and calls to the vehicles as INDY and
     HENRY SMASH THROUGH THE BARRICADE.

                         GUARD
          Halt! Halt!

     THE NAZI SOLDIER rides his motorcycle through the other side of the barrier--
     IT SHATTERS.

     INDY AND HENRY

     INDY grabs at a FLAGPOLE as they roar past—it snaps off in his hand.

     The NAZI SOLDIER drives his motorcycle toward INDY and HENRY. He
     unshoulders his machine gun.

     INDY uses the broken flagpole as a lance and knocks the NAZI SOLDIER from his
     motorcycle.

     THE RIDERLESS MOTORCYCLE

     drives on toward the other NAZI SOLDIERS now approaching the guardhouse,
     COLLIDING WITH TWO OF THEM.

     The remaining NAZI SOLDIER maneuvers his motorcycle around his fallen
     comrades and continues the chase.


     INDY AND HENRY

     As the remaining NAZI SOLDIER rides alongside their motorbike he cocks his gun,
     preparing to fire.

     INDY quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole through the spokes of the
     Nazi's front wheel.

     The NAZI SOLDIER'S MOTORCYCLE FLIPS THREE TIMES, throwing him high into
     the air.


CONTINUED:

     INDY glances back and smiles, but the smile fades as he looks forward again to
     see a sign at a CROSSROAD. Arrows pointing in opposite directions indicate the
     way to BERLIN or VENEDIG.

     Indy starts down the road marked VENEDIG.

               HENRY
          Stop!

               INDY
          What?

               HENRY
          Stop! Stop!

     The motorbike skids to a stop.


                         HENRY
          You're going the wrong Way!  We
          have to get to Berlin!

               INDY
               (pointing towards
                Venedig)
          Brody's this way.

                         HENRY
          My Diary's in Berlin.

                         INDY
          You don't need the Diary, Dad.
          Marcus has the map.

                         HENRY
          There is more in the Diary than
          just the map.

                         INDY
          All right Dad—tell me.

                         HENRY
          Well, he who finds the Grail must
          face the final challenge.

                         INDY
          What final challenge?

                         HENRY
          Three devices of such lethal
          cunning.

                         INDY
          Booby traps?


CONTINUED: (2)

                         HENRY
          Oh, yes. But I found the clues
          that will safely take us through,
          in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.

                         INDY
          But what are they? Can't you
          remember?

                         HENRY
          I wrote them down in my Diary so
          that I wouldn't have to remember

                         INDY
          Half the German Army's on our
          tail and you want me to go to
          Berlin? Into the lion's den?

                         HENRY
          Yes! The only thing that matters
          is the Grail.

                         INDY
          What about Marcus?

                         HENRY
          Marcus would agree with me.

                         INDY
          Two selfless martyrs. Jesus
          Christl

     HENRY slaps him across the face. INDY is rocked to his foundations, not by any
     means entirely by the blow itself.

                         HENRY
          That's for blasphemy. The quest
          for the Grail is not archaeology.
          It's a race against evil.
          If it is captured by the Nazis,
          the armies of darkness will march
          all over the face of the earth.
          Do you understand me?

                         INDY
          This is an obsession Dad. I never
          understood it. Never. Neither
          did Mom.

                         HENRY
          Oh yes, she did. Only too well.
          Unfortunately she kept her illness
          from me until all I could do was
          mourn her.

     EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

     Arrows point in opposite directions to VENICE and BERLIN. The CAMERA MOVES
     IN on the portion of the sign reading BERLIN.


     EXT. CITY SQUARE - BERLIN - NIGHT

     A Nazi Rally—a book-burning is in process.

     The mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as College
     Students and Nazi Brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire.

     Flags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically
     from side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous
     crowd.

     INDY and HENRY walk toward the Square. Indy wears the uniform of a Nazi
     Soldier. He is now buttoning up the tunic—which happens to be several sizes
     too big.

               HENRY
          My boy, we are Pilgrims in an
          unholy land.

     Then... Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. WE PAN ALONG
     HIS LINE OF SIGHT to:

     THE PODIUM

     where high-ranking Officers of the Third Reich stand flanking ADOLF HITLER as
     they oversee the rally.


     ANOTHER ANGLE

     ELSA is walking away in an open area, background of torches, vehicles, Nazi
     Officers... one of whom is now none other than INDY, coming up to her before she
     knows he is there. His voice is quiet and tough, his eyes hard.

                                           INDY
          Fraulein Doctor. Where is it?

     Still startled, her reaction makes it clear that Indy is even now a lover in her
     thoughts.

                                           ELSA
          How did you get here?

                                           INDY
          Where is it? I want it.

     INDY pushes ELSA against a column and begins to search her clothing for the
     Diary. He pulls the book from Elsa's pocket.


CONTINUED:

                         ELSA
          You came back for the book?
          Whv?

                         INDY
          My father didn't want it
          incinerated.

     She understands him. It's as though he slapped her.

                         ELSA
          Is that what you think of me?
          I believe in the Grail, not the
          Swastika.

               INDY
                (vicious)
          Yet you stood up to be counted
          with the enemy of everything the
          Grail stands for—who gives a
          damn what you think?


               ELSA
               (hard and fast)
          You do.

     Now it's as though she'd slapped him back. His hands fly to her neck.

               INDY
          All I have to do is squeeze.

               ELSA
          All I have to do is scream.

     It's a standoff emotionally. He knows he'd never do it. she knows it too. And
     the same goes for screaming.

     INDY releases her and backs away. she looks at him with a lover's pain. He
     moves over to HENRY.

               INDY
          I've got it. Let's get the hell
          out of here.

     They move off and almost run headlong into HITLER and his entire entourage
     coming down from the Podium. 50 kids push their autograph books for Hitler's
     signature.

     HITLER pauses to sign them. Hitler looks Indy's way. They make eye contact. It
     only lasts a moment but the moment is electric.

     HITLER breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, opens it to the first
     page and signs his autograph. He hands it back and moves on.

     EXT. AIRFIELD - BERLIN, GERMANY- DAY

     Indy's motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal.


     INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - DAY

     A Plainclothes Agent distributes leaflets bearing HENRY'S PICTURE to Nazi
     Soldiers inside the terminal.

     HENRY leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as INDY enters down the stairs
     and taps Henry's shoulder.

     They begin to walk toward the boarding gates.

                         HENRY
          What did you get?

                         INDY
          I don't know. The first available
          flight out of Germany.

                         HENRY
          Good.

     INDY and HENRY show their papers to the Boarding Guards, then join the line of
     passengers, which has already begun to move toward a:


     MOORED ZEPPELIN

     Ten stories tall and longer than two football fields: Flying in the grand tradition!


     INT. THE ZEPPELIN - PASSENGER COMPARTMENT - DAY

     The Zeppelin is about to take off. INDY and HENRY make themselves comfortable
     in one of the compartments.

                         INDY
          Well, we made it.

     HENRY looks over his newspaper at INDY.

                         HENRY
          When we're airborne, with Germany
          behind us, then I'll share that
          sentiment.

                         INDY
          Relax.

     But INDY looks out the window and is suddenly concerned when he sees:
     VOGEL AND A GESTAPO AGENT
     rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin.

                       VOGEL
          Nicht zumachen! Wir steigen ein!

     INDY

     sits back in his chair, looks to HENRY, now reading his newspaper.

     A STEWARD enters and sets a bowl of nuts on the table in front of INDY and
     HENRY, then continues down the aisle of passengers. Indy follows after the
     Steward. He puts his arm around the Steward's shoulder and together they walk
     up a flight of stairs.

     VOGEL

     now walks up the aisle. He approaches a MALE PASSENGER hidden behind a
     newspaper. VOGEL uses his walking stick to lower the newspaper and show the
     Passenger the leaflet with Henry's photograph.

               VOGEL
          Haben sie disen Mann gesehen?

     The Passengers at the table shake their heads in the negative. VOGEL shows the
     picture to other Passengers.

               FEMALE PASSENGER
          Nein.

               INDY (O.S.)
          Fahrscheine, bitte.

               MALE PASSENGER
          Nein.

     VOGEL turns to see:

     INDY

     WEARING THE HAT AND JACKET OF THE CHIEF STEWARD.

               MALE PASSENGER (O.S.)
          Ich habe ihn night gesehen.

               INDY
          Tickets please.

     The Passengers do not react to the request, made in English.

               INDY
          Fahrscheine meine Dame. Bitte.

     VOGEL

     approaches HENRY, still hidden behind his newspaper. Again, VOGEL uses his
     walking stick to lower the paper, revealing Henry's face.

               VOGEL
          Guten Tag, Herr Jones.

     Now INDY, still playing the role of Steward, asks VOGEL for his ticket.

               INDY
          Fahrscheine meine Herr.

               VOGEL
          Weg.

               INDY
          Tickets please.

     HENRY looks confused.

               VOGEL
                (in German)
          Was?



     VOGEL glances up and recognizes INDY—who quickly punches Vogel in the face,
     knocking him toward the window. In another quick move, Indy TOSSES HIM OUT
     THE WINDOW onto the tarmac below.

     Shocked Passengers blink in bewilderment.

               INDY
               (in German; with a
                shrug)
          No ticket.

     Everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy's face.


     EXT. AIRFIELD TARMAC - DAY

     VOGEL gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the sky above him,
     revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship. Vogel shakes his fist at
     the rising Zeppelin.

               VOGEL
          Du wirst nochmal boren von mir!

     INT. ZEPPELIN - DAY

     INDY and HENRY together again in their compartment.

                          HENRY
          You know, sharing your adventures
          is an interesting experience.

CONTINUED:

               INDY
                  (meaning ELSA)
          That's not all we shared. It's
          disgraceful. You're old enough to
          be her fa---er, her grandfather!

                         HENRY
          Well, I'm as human as the next
          man.

                         INDY
          I was the next man.

                         HENRY
                 (laughs)
          Ships that pass in the night...

     HENRY opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it.

                         INDY
          Do you remember the last time we
          had a quiet drink? I had a milk
          shake.

                         HENRY
          Hmmm... What did we talk about?

                         INDY
          We didn't talk. We never talked.

                         HENRY
          And do I detect a rebuke?

                         INDY
          A regret. It was just the two of
          us, Dad. It was a lonely way to
          grow up. For you, too. If you
          had been an ordinary, average
          father like the other guys' dads,
          you'd have understood that.

                         HENRY
          Actually, I was a wonderful father.

               INDY
          When?


     HENRY looks up from his Diary.

                         HENRY
          Did I ever tell you to eat up?
          Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do
          your homework? No. I respected
          your privacy and I taught you self-
          reliance.


CONTINUED: (2)


                         INDY
          What you taught me was that I was
          less important to you than people
          who had been dead for five hundred
          years in another country. And I
          learned it so well that we've
          hardly spoken for twenty years.

                         HENRY
          You left just when you were
          becoming interesting.

                         INDY
          Dad, how can you --?

               HENRY
                  (interrupting)
          Very well. I'm here now.

     He closes the Diary and leans back in his seat.

                         HENRY
          What do you want to talk about?
          Hmmm?

     INDY stutters uncomfortably as HENRY stares at him, waiting for a response.

               INDY
                  (laughs)
          Well... I can't think of anything.

                         HENRY
          Then what are you complaining
          about?
                  (laughs)
          Look, we have work to do. When
          we get to Alexandretta we will
          face three challenges.
                  (he reads from the
                   Diary)
          "First, the breath of God. Only
          the penitent man will pass.
          Second, the Word of God, only in
          the footsteps of God will he
          proceed. Third, the Path of God,
          only in the leap from the lion's
          head will he prove his worth. "

                         INDY
          What does that mean?

               HENRY
                  (laughs)
          I don't know. We'll find out.


CONTINUED: (3)


     Sunlight falls across the table from the window. INDY reaches for the drink. The
     bar of sunlight turns like the hand of a clock over the tabletop across the drinks.

     We see INDY puzzled. Only for a moment.

                         INDY
          They're turning around. They're
          taking us back to Germany.


     INT. FRAMEWORK OF ZEPPELIN - DAY

     INDY and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly of the Zeppelin.
     The Zeppelin's elaborate metal framework is exposed.

     INDY and HENRY hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a PAIR OF
     DOORWAYS framed into the Zeppelin's outer skin.

                         INDY
          Well, I thought it would take
          them a lot longer to figure out
          the radio was dead. Come on,
          Dad. Move!

     Then INDY opens the doors. We see plenty of blue sky and white clouds. We also
     see a small BIPLANE that is suspended from the Zeppelin by a HOOK & CRANE
     DEVICE.

                         INDY
          Come on, Dad. Come on!

     EXT. AIRPLANE - DAY

     INDY climbs into the cockpit of the Biplane as HENRY takes the tail gunner's
     seat.

               HENRY
                 (with delight)
          I didn't know you could fly a
          plane.

                         INDY
          Fly--yes. Land--no.


     INT. THE BIPLANE - DAY

     INDY turns in his seat to give HENRY the "thumbs up." Henry smiles valiantly
     and points down to the ground.

     Then they both become aware of a STRANGE SOUND in the skies behind them.
     Something between a ROAR and a WAIL.
     TWO MESSERSCHMIDT FIGHTER BOMBERS

     streak out of the clouds and race across the sky.


     INDY AND HENRY

     shrink in their seats as the MESSERSCHMIDTS (going three times as fast as they
     are) SCREAM past on either side.

                         INDY
          Dad, you're gonna have to use the
          machine gun. Get it ready.

     HENRY turns and grips the MOUNTED MACHINE GUN with a perplexed
     expression.

               INDY
                  (turning; pointing)
          Eleven o'clock!

     HENRY pulls out his watch.

                         INDY
          Dad—eleven o'clock!!

                         HENRY
          What happens at eleven o'clock?

     INDY uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a direction and not a
     time.

               INDY
                  (frustrated)
          Twelve—eleven—ten. Eleven
          o'clock. Fire!

     HENRY does—and the EXPLODING GUN nearly shakes him out of his seat.

     Indy's slow speed and small size works to his advantage. The speeding
     Messerschmidts continually overshoot him, WHIZZING past in a blur—making
     wide turns miles away in the sky.

     HENRY has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls back on the trigger
     --RATTA-A-TAT-TAT!  RATTA-A-TAT-TAT!

     The Messerschmidt banks to the left, but HENRY keeps it in his gun sight. Henry
     swings the gun around, inadvertently CUTTING HIS OWN REAR STABILIZER IN
     HALF.

                         INDY
          Dad, are we hit?!

               HENRY
          More or less.

CONTINUED:


               HENRY
          Son, I'm sorry. They got us.

     INDY looks back at the missing tail section, then at his father.

     The plane begins to go down. INDY struggles to control its descent.

               INDY
          Hang on, Dads We're going in!

     HENRY slumps down fearfully in his seat.


     EXT. A FIELD - DAY

     The wheels of the plane touch down. OUT OF CONTROL, the PLANE SKIDS and
     CRASHES first into a corral of goats and then into the farmhouse beyond sending
     a cloud of dust into the air.

     As INDY pulls himself from the cockpit:

               HENRY
                  (sarcastic)
          Nice landing.

               INDY
          Thanks.


     Suddenly, INDY's attention is directed to:


     TWO SCREAMING MESSERSCHMIDTS

     coming in low. Guns BLAZING.

     As BULLETS EXPLODE around them, INDY and HENRY jump over a stone
     barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy.

                         HENRY
          Those people are trying to kill
          us!

               INDY
          I know, Dadl

               HENRY
          It's a new experience for me.

               INDY
          It happens to me all the time.


     EXT. ROAD - DAY

     An OLD MAN kneels at his car repairing a rear tire.

     THE MAN

     turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands. Suddenly the wheel moves forward,
     startling the Old Man.


     INT. THE CAR - TRAVELING - DAY

     INDY has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel.
     HENRY is a very nervous passenger.

     INDY sees a LOW-FLYING MESSERSCHMIDT coming up behind him in the SIDE
     MIRROR.

     As the Messerschmidt ROARS by overhead, BULLETS EXPLODE around them,
     narrowly missing the car.

                         HENRY
          This is intolerable!

                         INDY
          This could be close.


     EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY

     The car races toward a TUNNEL that cuts through a steep MOUNTAINSIDE.

     The Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car, machine guns CHATTERING.

     The car ENTERS the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up in time. It
     SLAMS into the MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL, SHEARING OFF its WINGS.


     INT. THE TUNNEL - DAY

     The FLAMING FUSELAGE continues to ROCKET through the tunnel like a bullet
     down the muzzle of a gun. SPARKS fly as its belly SCRAPES against the
     pavement and the sides of the tunnel.


     INT. THE CAR - DAY

     Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless BALL OF FIRE
     gaining on them; about to overtake them.

               HENRY
          Faster, boy --faster!


     EXT. THE ROAD - OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

     The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the
     road. The flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and
     EXPLODES in the middle of the road.

     INT. THE CAR - DAY

     As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the sweat from his brow.

               HENRY
          Well, they don't come any closer
          than that!

     HENRY looks out the windshield and sees the second Messerschmidt SCREAMING
     out of the sky toward them.


     EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY

     The MESSERSCHMIDT drops its single UNDER-FUSELAGE BOMB. It EXPLODES in
     the road directly ahead of the car, missing it by only several feet.

     THE CAR

     FALLS INTO THE HOLE made by the bomb.

     DISSOLVE TO:


     EXT. ROAD - DAY

     INDY climbs out of the car, still in the bomb crater. He turns back to HENRY.

                         INDY
          Dad, he's coming back.

     INDY and HENRY run down the mountainside to:


     A DESERTED MEDITERRANEAN BEACH - DAY

     INDY and HENRY run to the shoreline. Indy reaches for his gun, tucked in his
     pants. He opens the chamber—the GUN HAS NO BULLETS.


     THE MESSERSCHMIDT

     swings around and is coming in for another pass.


     INDY AND HENRY

     exchange a wordless glance. They don't even think about running: there is no
     place to run to. HENRY hands his case to INDY.

     Holding his umbrella, HENRY suddenly spins around and runs screaming and
     shouting into A FLOCK OF SEA GULLS...

     THE SEA GULLS take to the wing in flight. Thousands of them.

     INDY

     Bullets kick up sand leading up to him... then—

     THE MESSERSCHMIDT AND THE SEA GULLS meet in midair. MASSACRE! Sea
     gulls are shredded by the Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a
     FEATHERY WHITE PUREE that SPLATTERS against the cockpit and CLOGS THE
     ENGINE.

     ENGINE SPUTTERS... STALLS... Silence. The Messerschmidt falls from the skies
     and EXPLODES in an OFF CAMERA SOUND EFFECT.

     INDY stands as before—stunned—a statue.

     HENRY walks back to INDY.

                         HENRY
          I suddenly remembered Charlemagne.
          "Let my armies be the rocks and the
          trees and the birds in the sky."
                 (he chuckles)

     INDY wears a proud expression as he watches HENRY walk down the beach.


     EXT. MOSQUE - DAY

     FADE IN TITLE: "REPUBLIC OF HATAY"

     FADE OUT TITLE.


     EXT. COURTYARD OF SULTAN'S PALACE - ISKENDERUN - DAY

     The SULTAN is seated in his royal chair, flanked by WALTER DONOVAN and
     VOGEL and surrounded by his minions.

     DONOVAN holds the missing Grail Diary pages.

                         DONOVAN
          These pages are taken from Professor
          Jones' diary, Your Highness. And
          they include a map that pinpoints
          the exact location of the Grail.

     DONOVAN and the SULTAN walk together through an archway.

                         DONOVAN
          As you can see, the Grail is all
          but in our hands.
                (beat)
          However, Your Highness, we
          would not think of crossing your
          soil without your permission,
          nor of removing the Grail from
          your borders without suitable
          compensation.


CONTINUED:


                         SULTAN
          What have you brought?

                         VOGEL
          Bring den Schatzl

     TWO NAZI SOLDIERS bring forward a HUGE STEAMER TRUNK. They open the lid
     and begin to empty it of its contents:

     Gold and silver objects of every description.

                         DONOVAN
          Precious valuables, Your Highness,
          "donated" by some of the finest
          families in all of Germany.

     The SULTAN gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk. He goes right
     past it and begins to inspect the Nazi staff car parked nearby.

                         SULTAN
          Rolls-Royce Phantom Two. 4.3
          litre, 30 horsepower, six cylinder
          engine, with Stromberg Downdraft
          carburetor.

     The SULTAN points to the engine under the hood.

                         SULTAN
          Can go from zero to 100 kilometres
          an hour in 12.5 seconds. And I
          even like the color.

               DONOVAN
                 (after a beat)
          The keys are in the ignition,
          Your Highness.

                         SULTAN
          You shall have camels, horses, an
          armed escort, provisions, desert
          vehicles—and tanksl

               DONOVAN
          You're welcome.

     Somebody else is also taking note...and we see that it is KAZIM, the spy at the
     court.

     ELSA is revealed coming down the stairs toward DONOVAN and VOGEL.

                                          ELSA
          We have no time to lose. Indiana
          Jones and his father have escaped.

     EXT. ISKENDERUN STREET - DAY

     SALLAH drives his car through the crowded streets, INDY beside him and HENRY
     in the back seat.

                         SALLAH
          We go this way.

     SALLAH waves his arms and shouts to a CAMEL HERDER.

                         SALLAH
          Get that camel out of the way!

               INDY
          What happened to Marcus, Sallah?

               SALLAH
                (overlapping)
          Ah, they set out across the desert
          this afternoon. I believe they
          took Mister Brody with them.

     HENRY removes his hat and hits INDY with it.

                         HENRY
          Now they have the map! And in
          this sort of race, there's no
          silver medal for finishing second.


     EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

Elsa and Donovan's party—consisting of a SUPPLY TRUCK, OPEN CAR, TUhKISH
SOLDIERS RIDING CAMELS, SPARE HORSES AND A TANK AND VARIOUS OTHER
VEHICLES—all moving along through the ramble of this box canyon.

ELSA, DONOVAN and VOGEL travel in the open car. The TANK is a vintage World
War I model with enormous treads. The Turkish soldiers wear native dress and
carry both carbines and sabers.

BRODY sits alongside ELSA in the rear of the car carrying DONOVAN. Donovan
hands a canteen back to him.

                         DONOVAN
          Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?

               BRODY
          I'd rather spit in your face.
          But as I haven't got any spit...

     VOGEL snatches the canteen away from BRODY before he can drink.

                         VOGEL
          We must be within three or four
          miles. Otherwise we are off the
          map.


CONTINUED:


     He hands the map to ELSA, drinks from the canteen, and hands that back to
     DONOVAN.

                         DONOVAN
          Well, Marcus, we are on the brink
          of the recovery of the greatest
          artifact in the history of mankind.

                         BRODY
          You're meddling with powers you
          cannot possibly comprehend.

     HENRY and SALLAH are at INDY's side as he views Donovan's party in the
     distance. Parked nearby is a CAR containing all of their supplies.

                         INDY
          Ah, I see Brody. He seems okay.
          They've got a tank. Six-pound
          gun.

     Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills.

     What he sees is:


     THE SUN REFLECTING OFF THE LENSES OF INDY'S BINOCULARS

               HENRY
          What do you think you're doing?!
          Get down!

                         INDY
          Dad, we're well out of range.

     At that moment the tank FIRES A SHELL in their direction.

     It WHISTLES overhead and BLOWS UP THE PARKED CAR. INDY, HENRY and
     SALLAH cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them.

                         SALLAH
          That car belonged to my brother-
          in-law.

               INDY
                (gesturing to the
                 others)
          Come on--come on!


     EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

                         VOGEL
          I can't see anyone up there.


CONTINUED:

                         DONOVAN
          Maybe it wasn't even Jones.

                         ELSA
          No. It's him all right. He's
          here somewhere.

               DONOVAN
                (to VOGEL)
          Put Brody in the tank.

     KAZIM peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group below.

               DONOVAN
                (to ELSA)
          Well, in this sun, without
          transportation, they're as good
          as dead.

     BULLETS EXPLODE off the vehicles and cliff. DONOVAN and ELSA duck.

     A NAZI SOLDIER falls from the tank as BULLETS EXPLODE around him.

     KAZIM'S MEN, BRETHREN OF THE CRUCIFORM SWORD, continue to FIRE. ELSA
     and DONOVAN take cover beside the parked car.

                         DONOVAN
          It's Jones, all right.


     ANGLE ON INDY'S GROUP

     INDY and HENRY, followed by SALLAH, take cover behind a rock to watch
     Kazim's Men and the Nazi Troops exchanging fire below them.

                         HENRY
          Now, who are all these people?

                         INDY
          Who cares? As long as they're
          keeping Donovan busy. Dad, you
          stay here while Sallah and I
          organize some transportation.

     CUT BACK to the action. The BRETHREN are firing at the
     DONOVAN party and are being fired on by the Donovan party.

     TWO NAZI SOLDIERS throw HAND GRENADES into the cliffs. They EXPLODE,
     killing one of Kazim's Brethren.

     The battle continues—a fierce exchange of GUNSHOTS, GRENADES and
     MACHINE GUN FIRE with losses on both sides.

     INDY AND SALLAH

     crouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the battle run amongst
     camels and horses.

               INDY
          I'm going after those horses.

               SALLAH
          I'll take the camels.

               INDY
          I don't need camels.

               SALLAH
          But, Indy—

               INDY
          No camels!


     DONOVAN AND ELSA

     They look down at KAZIM who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet.
     ELSA looks saddened.

               DONOVAN
                (re KAZIM)
          Who is he?

                         KAZIM
          A messenger from God. For the
          unrighteous, the Cup of Life
          holds everlasting damnation.

     KAZIM dies.


     INDY

     leaps atop a TURKISH SOLDIER on horseback, pulling the man and the horse to
     the ground. A SECOND TURK comes to assist his comrade; INDY mounts the
     horse, knocking both Turks to the ground.


     INT. THE TANK - DAY

     BRODY has been left alone in the tank. HENRY climbs down into the tank and
     taps Brody on the shoulder, startling him.

                         HENRY
          Marcus!

                         BRODY
          Arghhh! Oh!


CONTINUED:

     They exchange an old University Club toast, swinging their arms at one another
     and missing. Then HENRY flaps his arms and tugs his ears.

               HENRY
          "Genius of the Restoration—"

     Now BRODY tugs his ears, flaps his arms and touches his head.

               BRODY
          "—aid our own resuscitation!"

     They exchange a handshake.

               BRODY
          Henryl What are you doing here?!

               HENRY
          It's a rescue, old boys Come on.


     As HENRY starts to climb out of the tank, TWO NAZI SOLDIERS DROP DOWN from
     above, their Lugers drawn. They are followed by VOGEL.

               VOGEL
                 (re HENRY)
          Search him.

     The NAZI SOLDIERS point their guns at HENRY and BRODY.

               VOGEL
                 (to HENRY)
          What is in this book? That
          miserable little Diary of yours!

     VOGEL removes a glove and slaps HENRY with it.

               VOGEL
          Here's the map. The book is
          useless, and yet you come all the
          way back to Berlin to get it.
          Why? 

     He slaps HENRY again.

               VOGEL
          What are you hiding?

     Another slap.

               VOGEL
          What does the Diary tell you that
          it doesn't tell us?!

     VOGEL reaches out to slap HENRY yet again, but Henry grabs his arm, stopping
     him.


CONTINUED: (2)

                         HENRY
          It tells me that goose-stepping
          morons like yourself should try
          reading books instead of burning
          them.

     DONOVAN appears at the turret cover.

                         DONOVAN
          Colonel? Jones is getting away.

                         VOGEL
                  (indicating HENRY)
          I think not, Herr Donovan.


     EXT. TANK - DAY

                         DONOVAN
          Not that Jones—the other Jones!

                         NAZI SOLDIER
          Herr Colonel!


     EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     INDY rides away on one horse, leading three others as he goes.

     SALLAH approaches on horseback leading five camels.

                         INDY
          Sallah, I said no camels! That's
          five camels. Can't you Count?

                         SALLAH
          Compensation for my brother-in-
          law's car. Indy, your father and
          Brody—

                         INDY
          Where's my father?

                         SALLAH
          They have them. In the belly of
          that steel beast.

     INDY and SALLAH charge forward leading their horses and camels.

     Then VOGEL commands the Tank Driver to give chase.


     INT. TANK - DAY

     VOGEL shouts to the Tank Driver.

               VOGEL
          Fire!


     EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY


     The tank starts firing at INDY on horseback. Indy zigs and zags as the tank fires
     two rounds at Indy, barely missing him. Each time Indy emerges from the plume
     of desert dust, hanging like a toadstool in the air.


     INT. TANK- DAY

     HENRY and BRODY hold their hands over their ears.


     EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     DONOVAN shouts orders to the Troops. INDY is followed by various vehicles in
     the caravan.

     INDY notices that the side gun that is now firing at him can only pivot so far.
     Indy makes a mental note of this and while riding right in front of the tank,
     turns his horse completely around, 180 degrees. The tank starts to follow.


     POV THROUGH THE VIEWING PORT

     VOGEL watches the ground turning 180 degrees as he tries to catch up with
     INDY.

     Cleverly, INDY has turned the tank directly into a head-on
     collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a Kubelwagon.

     The tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German military sedan
     becoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of
     the six-pound cannon on the turret.

     INDY, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone from the wall of
     a culvert. He reigns his horse, paralleling the tank, as everyone scurries about
     inside, looking through viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where Indy is.


     INT. TANK- DAY

     VOGEL shouts to the Gunner.

                                           VOGEL
          Der Kubelwagon sprengen!

     The Gunner puts a shell into the large gun. He FIRES, CATAPULTING THE
     KUBELWAGON into the air, where it EXPLODES.  The tank drives through the
     resulting smoke an dust, then rolls over the Kubelwagon, crushing it
     
     EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     INDY gallops up to the side cannon and jams the stone down the barrel, lodging
     several rocks inside. Then he steers his horse directly in range of that gun.


     INT. TANK - DAY

     A NAZI SOLDIER pushes HENRY away from the window.

                                        NAZI SOLDIER
          Keine Bewegung.

     He points his gun at HENRY and BRODY.

               NAZI SOLDIER
          Keine Bewegung.

     The smaller gun, blocked by the rocks, BACKFIRES, blowing the breech out into
     the face of the gunner, killing him and filling the tank with smoke.

     BRODY, HENRY, VOGEL and the driver begin to choke.


     EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     INDY rides his horse alongside the tank.

               INDY
          Dad!  Dad!  Dad!


     INT. TANK - DAY

     HENRY and BRODY still held at gunpoint by the NAZI SOLDIER.

               HENRY
          Junior? Junior? Junior!

     The NAZI SOLDIER swings his fist, knocking HENRY off his seat.


     EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     Smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open. VOGEL emerges
     and aims his gun at INDY.

     INDY and VOGEL EXCHANGE SHOTS as Indy chases the tank on his horse.

     INDY pulls the trigger again—his gun is empty! Indy immediately takes the
     high trail.

     Now INDY is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail. He moves out of
     the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank.


     CLOSE UP - VOGEL

     Hate-staring at INDY

     CLOSE UP - INDY

     Hate-staring back at VOGEL.

Suddenly, from nowhere a German soldier flies INTO FRAME, tackling Indy.

                         CUT TO:

     SIDE ANGLE

     One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a
     galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over INDY.

     INDY is struggling with a German's Luger.

     INDY presses the luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a
     shot into himself. The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes
     through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top
     and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief.
     
     Another Soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises his knife as he
     grabs INDY. They struggle and fall.

     INDY sits up to see VOGEL standing over him. Vogel wraps a chain around Indy's
     neck.


     INT. TANK- DAY

     INDY appears at the entrance, the chain still wrapped about his neck and held by
     VOGEL.

               INDY
          Dad!

     He drops the gun down into the tank.

               INDY
          Dad! Dadl Get it!

     VOGEL pulls INDY from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain wrapped around
     his neck.


     EXT. TANK - DAY

     A NAZI SOLDIER approaches.

     INDY hits him, knocking him onto the tank tread. The Nazi Soldier screams as he
     is dragged under the rolling tank.

     Now INDY and VOGEL struggle with one another, the chain still wrapped around
     Indy's neck.


     INT. TANK- DAY

     THROUGH THE PERISCOPE

     We SEE INDY and VOGEL struggling atop the tank. Indy lifts his feet, lunging
     toward the periscope and pulling Vogel with him.

     INDY's face is pressed up against the lens of the periscope.


     INT. TANK - DAY

     The NAZI SOLDIER looking through the periscope pulls away from it, smiles, then
     turns back to it.


     THROUGH THE PERISCOPE

     INDY's face, still pressed against the lens.

     VOGEL pulls INDY from the periscope.


     INT. TANK - DAY

     The NAZI SOLDIER pulls away from the periscope again.

               PERISCOPE SOLDIER
                  (laughing)
          Diese Amerikane. Sie Kampfen wie
          Weiber.

     EXT. TANK - DAY

     INDY now lies on top of VOGEL. He kicks out at the periscope which spins
     around.


     INT. TANK - DAY

     The periscope handle spins around and hits the PERISCOPE SOLDIER in the head.
     He falls against the NAZI SOLDIER guarding HENRY and BRODY.

     HENRY pushes the NAZI SOLDIER aside and grabs the gun. The PERISCOPE
     SOLDIER struggles to take the gun from Henry.


     EXT. TANK- DAY

     VOGEL holds the chain around INDY's neck, pushing his head downward toward
     the revolving tread.


     INT. TANK - DAY

     The PERISCOPE SOLDIER holds HENRY from behind, forcing the gun toward him.
     Henry reaches down and pulls a fountain pen from his coat pocket.



CONTINUED:

     As the PERISCOPE SOLDIER pulls on HENRY's face, Henry lifts the fountain pen
     and squirts ink into his face. The Soldier falls, his head smashing into the wall of
     the tank. At the same time, Henry loses his grip on the gun which falls to the
     floor.


               BRODY
          Henry, the pen—

               HENRY
          What?


                         BRODY
          But don't you see? The pen is
          mightier than the sword.


     EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

     A troop truck pulls near the tank.


     INT. TANK- DAY

     HENRY fires the TANK GUN at the troop truck. SOLDIERS FLY INTO THE AIR.
     The TROOP TRUCK flips over and EXPLODES.


     EXT. TANK - DAY

     The EXPLOSION knocks INDY off the tank and onto the tread. He grabs onto the
     shredded gun protruding from the side of the tank.

     VOGEL looks down at INDY and smiles smugly.

     The tank is approaching a cliff wall. As INDY tries to secure footing, VOGEL
     steps on his hands.


     INT. TANK - DAY

     BRODY looks at HENRY.

               BRODY
          Look what you didl

                         HENRY
          It's war.


     EXT. TANK - DAY

     VOGEL now swings a shovel at INDY, smashing at his hands.

     BRODY climbs up out of the tank, followed by HENRY.



CONTINUED:

               HENRY
          Didn't I tell you it was a rescue,
          huh?

     A NAZI SOLDIER appears and pulls HENRY down.

     VOGEL raises the shovel above his head and brings it crashing down on INDY,
     still hanging from the protruding gun.

     INDY loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended only by the strap of
     his leather pouch. He screams as the gun scrapes against the cliff wall, sending
     stones tumbling down over him.


     INT. TANK - DAY

     The NAZI SOLDIER knocks HENRY into a pile of boxes, then punches him in the
     face.

     As the SOLDIER raises the gun to HENRY's face, BRODY hits him over the head
     with a canister. The Soldier falls, discharging the gun into the air.

     The BULLET RICOCHETS around the tank, past the Tank Driver who is
     manipulating levers at the control panel. SPARKS FLY; then the BULLET PINGS
     AGAINST THE WINDOW and RICOCHETS ONCE MORE, this time passing THROUGH
     THE TANK DRIVER'S HAT. Blood flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver
     slumps forward, his body depressing the levers.


     EXT. TANK - DAY

     INDY still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves, barely
     missing the rocks and causing VOGEL to fall. Indy finally manages to pull
     himself atop the tank once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then
     peers down to HENRY, still inside the tank.

               INDY
          Dad?

               HENRY
          You call this archaeology?

               INDY
          Get out of there, Dad!

     INDY pulls HENRY and BRODY from the tank. VOGEL pulls himself back atop the
     tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs
     Vogel's arm.

               BRODY
          How does one get off this thing?

     As INDY winds up to punch VOGEL he catches BRODY in the face on the
     backswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down.

     INT. TANK - DAY

     Vogel's hat sails in and falls to the floor.


     EXT. TANK- DAY

               HENRY
                  (to INDY)
          Where's Marcus?!

     Before INDY can answer, VOGEL is up and swinging with the shovel. Indy ducks
     but the shovel catches HENRY sending him over the side and onto the moving
     tread.

     INDY grabs his whip, knocking VOGEL aside.

     As HENRY speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, INDY, with
     lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around
     Henry's right ankle.

               INDY
          Dad!

     HENRY is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll. INDY struggles to hold onto
     the end of the bullwhip.

               INDY
          Hang on, Dad!

     SALLAH draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez to HENEY.

                         SALLAH
          Father of Indy—give me your
          hand!

     VOGEL now punches INDY in the back and grabs him around the neck. Still,
     INDY refuses to let go of the whip.

               INDY
          Sallah! Get Dadl

     SALLAH reaches out to HENRY.

                         SALLAH
          Give me your hand!

     SALLAH manages to hold onto HENRY as he brings his horse to a stop just at the
     cliff's edge.

     INDY finally frees himself of VOGEL's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away
     from Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head.


     INDY

     looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror.  We SEE his
     HAT BLOW OFF and sail over the cliff's edge.

     VOGEL

     He sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top
     of his lungs!


     LONG SHOT

     The tank trundles over the cliff and PLUMMETS TO THE BOTTOM.


     EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DAY

     HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH look down at the flaming wreckage
     of the tank.

               HENRY
          Junior?!

     We HEAR the TANK EXPLODING.

               SALLAH
          Indy?!


                         HENRY
          Oh, God. I've lost him. And I
          never told him anything. I just
          wasn't ready, Marcus. Five
          minutes would have been enough.

     And then... looking dazed and bewildered, INDY STAGGERS UP BEHIND THEM.
     He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below
     with a bewildered expression.

     Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence.

     HENRY says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he
     throws his arms around him.

               HENRY
          I thought I'd lost you, boy.

     After a moment, Indy's head clears. And he becomes aware of his father's
     embrace. Something he hasn't felt in a long time—if ever. And it touches him.
     He hugs his father back.

                         INDY
          I thought you had too, sir.

     BRODY and SALLAH are moved by this sudden reconciliation.

               HENRY
          Well—well done! Come on!

     HENRY pats INDY on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff
     edge.



CONTINUED:

     Unaware, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY start to walk away. Henry turns back to
     see INDY still sitting on the ground.

                         HENRY
          Let's go then. why are you
          sitting there resting when we're
          so near the end? Come on—
          let's go!

     HENRY turns and walks toward the horse with BRODY and SALLAH. Suddenly
     the FEDORA, borne on the wind, BLOWS INTO SCENE and lands at INDY's feet.


     EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

     DONOVAN peers through binoculars to see the CANYON OF THE CRESCENT
     MOON. He lowers the binoculars and turns to ELSA.

               DONOVAN
          The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

     Now ELSA peers through the binoculars.


     EXT. SECRET CANYON - DAY

     INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY ride into the canyon. They hear a WAILING
     WIND. Feel the biting cold. And sense the danger.

     Now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city. Its spectacular Grecian
     facade is carved directly into the rock. It is a stunning sight. The vehicles,
     camels and horses belonging to DONOVAN's party have been left at the entrance.

                         CUT TO:


     INT. TEMPLE - DAY

     INDY, SALLAH, HENRY AND BRODY creep forward to see:

     THE TERRIFIED FACE OF A TURKISH SOLDIER

     He's walking slowly. Eyes darting. Muttering a prayer under his breath.
     What's going on here?


     FULL SHOT - INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN TEMPLE

     THE TURK stands alone in the center of the Temple. It is very dark. GIANT
     COLUMNS define the Temple's perimeter.

     ELSA AND DONOVAN

     watch him from a safe distance.

     THE TURK

     is about to approach the spot where a TURKISH SOLDIER LIES DEAD. We don't
     notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been DECAPITATED.

     THE TURK stops—only one step away from the beheaded soldier.


     THE TURK

     takes one more step—a fatal step, it turns out. We hear a ROAR—A WHOOSH
     of air—but we SEE NOTHING—except THE TURK'S HEAD FLY OFF AND
     BOUNCE across the ground.


     INDY, HENRY, BRODY AND SALLAH

     react to the sight.


     ELSA AND DONOVAN

     She looks at him, horrified.


               DONOVAN
          Helmut, another volunteer!

     TWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Suddenly...


     The SOUND OF RIFLE BOLTS being cocked. Everyone turns to discover INDY and
     his party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. Indy's group are relieved of their guns.


     FULL SHOT - THE TEMPLE

     INDY, HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH are brought forward by the Nazi Soldiers.


     ELSA's eyes light up: glad Indy's not dead. she controls herself and continues
     more coldly.

               ELSA
                 (to INDY)
          I never expected to see you again.

                          INDY
          I'm like a bad penny. I always
          turn up.

                          DONOVAN
          Step back now, Doctor Schneider.
          Give Doctor Jones some room. He's
          going to recover the Grail for us.



CONTINUED:

     INDY laughs.

                         DONOVAN
          Impossible? What do you say,
          Jones? Ready to go down in
          history?

               INDY
          As what? A Nazi stooge like you?

               DONOVAN
                 (scornfully)
          Nazis?!—Is that the limit of
          your vision?! The Nazis want to
          write themselves into the Grail
          legend and take on the world.
          Well, they're welcome. But I want
          the Grail itself. The cup that
          gives everlasting life.
          Hitler can have the world, but
          he can't take it with him. I'm
          going to be drinking my own health
          when he's gone the way of the
          Dodo.
                (he draws his
                 pistol)
          The Grail is mine, and you're
          going to get it for me.

               INDY
          Shooting me won't get you anywhere.

                         DONOVAN
          You know something, Doctor Jones?...
          you're absolutely right.

     Then DONOVAN shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS HENRY. The bullet enters
     his side below the ribs.

               INDY
          Dad?!

               HENRY
          Junior. . .

               ELSA
          No!!

               DONOVAN
               ( to ELSA)
          Get back!

     HENRY collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. BRODY and SALLAH rush to
     his assistance.



CONTINUED: (2)


     INDY spins toward DONOVAN with murder in his eyes.

     DONOVAN points the gun at him:

               DONOVAN
          You can't save him when you're
          dead.

     INDY hesitates.

                         DONOVAN
          The healing power of the Grail is
          the only thing that can save your
          father now. It's time to ask yourself
          what you believe.

     INDY takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of
     him. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. We get silent
     reaction shots—ELSA—SALLAH—BRODY—DONOVAN—registering their
     different emotions

     INDY proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary.

                         INDY
          "The Breath of God... Only the
          penitent man will pass. Only
          the penitent man will pass. . . "

     INDY takes a few steps forward.

                         INDY
          "The penitent man will pass.
          The penitent man..."

     INDY stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died.

     HENRY looks at INDY. Indy looks at Henry.

               HENRY
                  (in a raspy voice)
          "Only the penitent man will pass.
          Only the penitent man will pass."

               INDY
                  (quietly to himself)
          The penitent man will pass. The
          penitent... the penitent. The
          penitent man...

               HENRY
          The penitent man. The penitent...

     INDY takes a step forward through the cobwebs.



CONTINUED: (3)


               INDY
          The penitent man is humble before
          God.

               HENRY
          Penitent. Penitent...

               INDY
          The penitent man is humble...

     The cobwebs begin to move....

               INDY
          He kneels before God.
                 (to himself; suddenly)
          Kneel!!

     We hear the awful rush of air—WHOOSH! Because INDY is in the act of
     kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face.

     Instinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's way and looks up.
     From his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR
     SHARP TRIPLE PENDULUM.

     INDY gets cautiously to his feet. Now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a
     SMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden
     wheels turn—the mechanism controlling the spinning blades. INDY loops a rope
     around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid-swipe.

               INDY
          I'm through!


     ELSA AND DONOVAN

               DONOVAN
          We're through!

     BRODY and SALLAH smile, relieved.

               SALLAH
                (to HENRY)
          He's all right.

     HENRY shakes his head.

               HENRY
          No.

     BACK TO INDY

     holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs.


               INDY
          "The second challenge is the
           Word of God. Only in the
          footsteps of God will he proceed."
                 (to himself)
          The Word of God... The Word of...


     INDY pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. Each cobble is
     engraved with a letter.

               INDY
          "Proceed in the footsteps of the
          Word."



     HENRY

     lifts his head painfully.


               HENRY
          The Word of God...



               BRODY
          No, Henry. Try not to talk.


               HENRY
          The Name of God...

     BACK TO INDY

     as he studies the cobblestones before him.


               INDY
          The Name of God... Jehovahl



     HENRY

     still lies in SALLAH's arms. BRODY leans over him.


               HENRY
          But in the Latin alphabet,
          "Jehovah" begins with an "I."


     BACK TO INDY


               INDY
          "J."

     INDY takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and INDY falls up to his
     hip -- his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was.

     HENRY

     reacts.


                         HENRY
          Oh dear!

     BACK TO INDY

     who grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, the v-rail Diary in his hand.

                         INDY
          In Latin, "Jehovah" starts with
          an "I." "I"...

     Now we SEE each letter on the stones as INDY carefully walks forward.
     DONOVAN and ELSA follow in his footsteps.

               INDY
          "E"... "H"... "O"... "V"... "A"...


     INDY sighs with relief and steps forward to:


     THE GREAT ABYSS

     INDY stands in a small opening, just small enough for his shoulders to squeeze
     through and beyond that a 100 foot drop to the rocks below and 100 feet across,
     nothing but a rough, stony cliff wall.


     BACK TO INDY

     He can see nowhere to cross. He looks again to the v-rail Diary.

                         INDY
          "The path of flood. Only in the
          leap from the lion's head will
          he prove his worth."

     INDY looks around and then he notices that inscribed into
     the rock above his head is the head of a lion.

               INDY
          Impossiblel Nobody can jump this!

     INDY looks down into the Diary and tortures over what it
     is asking him to do.


     BRODY

     rushes forward and calls to INDY.

               BRODY
          Indy... Indy, you must hurry!!
          Come quickly!

     BACK TO INDY

               INDY
               (realizing)
          It's... a leap of faith. Oh,
          God.

     HENRY

     calls to his son.


                         HENRY
          You must believe, boy. you must...
          believe.

     We see him do it. We see him leap into space. We see that he is in midair. We
     see that he is not going to make it. His hands claw for the opposite wall but he is
     going to fall 100 feet to his death. And then—he doesn't! He appears to be held
     up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees.

     INDY looks around and down and now he figures it out.

     Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks
     100 feet below. It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with
     lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet
     are stepping.

     It's painted to blend in with the rocks below. Highly evolved camouflage... in
     perfect alignment with everything we see below.

     When INDY leans out to the left or right... that's when he sees the perfect
     alignment shift that betrays the trick. Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and
     he crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.

     Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple.

     A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple. Perhaps a
     hundred or more. Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all
     glitter and shine.

     INDY is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. And then he realizes that
     a man is praying at the altarl

     He has his back turned to INDY... but he is dressed as what he is! A GRAIL
     KNIGHT.


     CLOSE ON THE GRAIL KNIGHT

     But we can't see the Grail Knight's face. The visor of his helmet is down.
     Perhaps we see his eyes.



CONTINUED:

     When the GRAIL KNIGHT sees INDY he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly,
     prepares to give combat...taking up his two-handed broadsword...he comes at
     Indy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too
     much. Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt
     to fight back...until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. Indy
     approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a very ancient
     man.

                         KNIGHT
          I knew you'd come, but my strength
          has left me.

                         INDY
          Who are you?

                         KNIGHT
          The last of three brothers who
          swore an oath to find the Grail
          and to guard it.

                         INDY
          That was seven hundred years ago.

                         KNIGHT
          A long time to wait.

     The GRAIL KNIGHT reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing.

                         KNIGHT
          You're strangely dressed...for a
          knight.

                         INDY
          I'm not exactly...a knight. What
          do you mean?

                         KNIGHT
          I was chosen because I was the
          bravest and the most worthy. The
          honor was mine until another came
          to challenge me to single combat.
          I pass it to you who vanquished me.

     The GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY.

               INDY
                (gulp)
          Listen, I don't have time to
          explain, but—

     At that moment DONOVAN and ELSA appear. Donovan turns to face the display
     of cups.

                         DONOVAN
          Which one is it?



CONTINUED: (2)

                         KNIGHT
          You must choose.
               (beat)
          But choose wisely. For as the
          True Grail will bring you life—
          the False Grail will take it from
          you.

                         DONOVAN
          I'm not a historian. I have no
          idea what it looks like. Which
          one is it?

                         ELSA
          Let me choose.

                         DONOVAN
          Thank you, Doctor.

     ELSA and INDY exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors.

     ELSA chooses a cup—a solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet.

     DONOVAN instantly takes it from her.

                         DONOVAN
          Oh, yes. It's more beautiful than
          I'd ever imagined. This certainly
          is the cup of the King of Kings.

     DONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.

               DONOVAN
          Eternal life!

     DONOVAN drinks from the goblet.

     Then, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse. His face contorts in agony. He
     grabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA.

                         DONOVAN
          What . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . .
          me. . .?

     He starts to age—fast! His hair grows long and gray and brittle. His face sinks.
     Fingernails curl back on themselves. Milky cataracts coat his eyes.

     ELSA gasps and screams.

                                          DONOVAN
          What. . . is . . . happening. . . ?

     His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits.
     His skeletal hands reach for ELSA's throat, choking her.



CONTINUED: (3)

     INDY rushes forward and pushes DONOVAN away. As he falls he BODY BREAKS
     INTO FLAMES, then SHATTERS AGAINST THE WALL.

               KNIGHT
          He chose...poorly.

     INDY studies the array of chalices.


                                          ELSA
          It would not be made out of gold.

     INDY picks up another cup—a simple earthenware jug.

                                          INDY
          That's the cup of a carpenter.

     He and ELSA exchange a look.

                                          INDY
          There's only one way to find out.

     INDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses.
     INDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows.

     A strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we
     see his wounds begin to heal.

                                         KNIGHT
                 You have chosen wisely. But the
                 Grail cannot pass beyond the
                 Great Seal. That is the boundary
                 and the price of immortality.


     CUT TO BRODY AND SALLAH who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return.

     INDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail.

     The TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail. They put
     down their guns and kneel.

     INDY kneels by HENRY's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to
     his lips.

     HENRY is too weak to even open his eyes.

     HENRY swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the corners of his
     mouth. Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in
     astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The
     color returns to Henry's face.

     HENRY's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up. Then
     they shift to INDY's face—and they light up even more...

     NAZI SOLDIERS

     run forward. SALLAH points a rifle at them.

                                          SALLAH
          Drop your guns. Please.

     The NAZI SOLDIERS drop their weapons at their feet and raise their arms in
     surrender.

                                           INDY
               (to HENRY)
          Dad, come on. Get to your feet.

     ELSA

     steps forward and picks up the Grail. She turns to INDY, her face alight with
     possession of the Grail.

               ELSA
          We have got it. Come on.

     ELSA steps onto the edge of the Great Seal.

               INDY
          Elsa! Elsa, don't movel

                                           ELSA
          It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.

                                           INDY
          Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The
          Knight warned us not to take the
          Grail from here.

     A RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD and the ground roars and shifts. Dirt falls from
     the ceiling of the cavern. ELSA falls on the Great Seal. The Grail bounces away
     from her grasp. She reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT
     OPEN. ELSA slips into the crevasse. She screams.

     ELSA is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost within her reach.
     As her hands lose their grip, INDY just manages to one of them, he himself
     sliding forward across the slanted floor.

                                          HENRY
          Junior!  Junior!

     With her free hand, ELSA is trying to get the Grail. INDY can't save her unless
     she gives him her free hand. She has to choose.

               INDY
          Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa.
          Give me your other hand,
          honey. I can't hold you.



CONTINUED:

               ELSA
          I can reach it. I can reach it...

     Her hand begins to slip from Indy's grasp.

                          INDY
          Elsa! Give me your hand. Give
          me your other hand!

     ELSA just manages to touch the Grail. In doing so, she has tipped the balance too
     far—INDY slides down another yard, Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to
     her death.

               INDY
               (horrified)
          Elsa!!

     Now the ledge INDY lies upon begins to break apart. HENRY grabs one of his
     hands as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with the other.

               HENRY
          Junior, give me your other hand!
          I can't hold on!!

                          INDY
          I can get it—I can almost
          reach it, Dad.

     INDY looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him from which nothing
     can ever be retrieved.

               HENRY
          Indiana. Indiana!!

     INDY snaps his look up to his father. His father has never called him this before.


               HENRY
               (very calmly)
          ... let it go...


     INDY abandons the Grail and grabs onto HENRY with both hands.
     HENRY pulls him up to safety.


     THE GRAIL KNIGHT

     looks through the falling debris to INDY and HENRY. SALLAH and BRODY rush
     from the crumbling Temple.

               INDY
          Dad. . .

     The GRAIL KNIGHT raises his arm to HENRY.


CONTINUED:


               INDY
          Please, Dad...

     INDY and HENRY down the passageway just as a huge stone column tumbles
     down upon the spot where they stood. The GRAIL KNIGHT lowers his arm as he
     watches them leave.


     EXT. ENTRANCE TO MOUNTAIN TEMPLE - AFTERNOON

     INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY emerge from the Mountain Temple through
     the Grecian Facade.

     From within the Mountain Temple, the ROAR OF WALLS CAVING IN IS HEARD. A
     cloud of dust and smoke billows out from the entrance.

     HENRY turns to INDY.

               HENRY
          Elsa never really believed in the
          Grail. She thought she'd found a
          prize.

               INDY
          What did vou find, Dad?

               HENRY
          Me?... Illumination.

     HENRY and INDY mount their horses. Henry turns back to his son.

               HENRY
          What did you find, Junior?

               INDY
          Junior?! Dad...


               SALLAH
          Please...What does it always
          mean, this...this "Junior?"

               HENRY
          That's his name. Henry Jones,
          Junior.

               INDY
          I like Indiana.

               HENRY
          We named the dog Indiana.

               BRODY
          May we go home now, please?



CONTINUED:


               SALLAH
                  (to INDY)
          The dog!?
                  (laughs)
          You are named after the dog...

               INDY
                  (embarrassed)
          I've got a lot of fond memories
          of that dog.

     A moment passes as they all ready their mounts and SALLAH continues to laugh
     at INDY.

                         INDY
          Ready?

                         HENRY
          Ready.

                         BRODY
          Indy! Henryl Follow met I know
          the way!
                  (to his horse)
          Haaa!

               HENRY
                  (to INDY)
          Got lost in his own museum, huh?

               INDY
          Uh-huh.


                         HENRY
          After you, Junior.

               INDY
          Yes, sir!
             (to his horse)
          Haaa!          


     EXT. THE SECRET CANYON - AFTERNOON

     They THUNDER through the canyon—whose towering walls threaten to collapse
     upon them.


     EXT. ENTRANCE TO CANYON - SUNSET

     as BRODY, INDY, HENRY AND SALLAH ride from the canyon toward the SETTING
     SUN.

               THE END
