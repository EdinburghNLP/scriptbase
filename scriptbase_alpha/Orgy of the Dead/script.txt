                            "ORGY OF THE DEAD"


FADE IN:

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT.

     CLOSEUP of HEAVY RIVETED IRON DOORS with round handles
     covered by spider webs.

     Two "GIANTS", wearing leopard-skin shorts, iron bicep-bands and
     headbands, pull the heavy iron doors open revealing the
     INTERIOR of the MAUSOLEUM.  There is an ornate stone sarcophagus
     in the center of the room, raised up on an altar.  The back wall
     has a mantle with a bust of the Virgin Mary looking downward at
     the coffin.  There is a round red window in the center of the 
     wall.  A ray of red light shines through the window, 
     illuminating the misty fog hanging in the air.

     The giants walk into the Mausoleum.  They lift the heavy stone
     lid off of the coffin, revealing CRISWELL.  He is lying in the
     coffin on his back, with his arms crossed over his chest and 
     eyes closed.  He is wearing black suit pants, a white shirt, a
     black ribbon-like bow-tie, and a black satin cape.

     MEDIUM SHOT OF CRISWELL

     We see CRISWELL, Narrator of our tale and SOLE RULER OF THE 
     DARK WORLD, now sitting upright, slouching somewhat in his 
     coffin, glancing offscreen (at his cue card).

     During his monologue, each time Criswell looks up at the camera 
     a DRAMATIC PAUSE is inserted as he then looks back down at the
     cue card and searches for his place in order to continue.


                     CRISWELL
               I am Criswell!  For years I have 
               told the almost unbelievable, 
               related the unreal, and shown it 
               to be more...than a fact. 
               Now I tell a tale of the 
               threshold, people, so astounding
               that some of you may faint.

     MONOLOGUE CONTINUES AS CAMERA CUTS TO GRAVEYARD SEQUENCE:

     SHOT of an ancient TOMBSTONE, surrounded by fog, with a
     human SKULL sitting at its base.

                                     DISSOLVE TO:

     A plaque-like grave stone on the ground with fog swirling
     over it, a Skull and a long bone sitting on the ground by it

                     CRISWELL (Voice Over)
                   This is a story of those in 
                   the twilight time...once human, 
                   now monsters, in a void between 
                   the living and the dead.  
                   Monsters to be pitied, monsters 
                   to be despised...
                                 CUT BACK TO CRISWELL:

                        CRISWELL (continuing)
                   A night with the Ghouls...the 
                   ghouls reborn, from the 
                   innnermost depths...of the 
                   world.

EXT. HIGHWAY IN WILDERNESS.  "NIGHT"

     A CONVERTIBLE is driving along a DESERT ROAD.  LONG SHOTS of
     the automobile driving are filmed in bright sunlight.  The
     desert hills are clearly visible in the background, with only
     a slight darkening to suggest day-for-night, but the car's
     headlights are on so we clearly understand that it is pitch
     black in the dead of night.
                                   CUT TO:

     MEDIUM SHOT - BOB AND SHIRLEY IN CAR.  NIGHT

     BOB and SHIRLEY are seated in the CONVERTIBLE, driving through
     the night, on a "date".  They are searching for an ancient
     CEMETERY.  MEDIUM SHOTS have a pitch black background and dark
     shadows across the car.

     Shirley is leaning over in her seat toward Bob, who is
     driving.
      
                       SHIRLEY
                  We sure picked the wrong night
               to find a cemetery.  Let's turn
               back.
               
                    BOB
               No.  It's on a night like this
               when the best ideas come to mind.

                       SHIRLEY
               But does it have to be in a
               cemetery?

                    BOB
               You wouldn't understand.  Seeing
               a cemetery on a night like this
               can stir in the mind the best
               ideas for a good horror story.

                       SHIRLEY
               But there're so many wonderful
               things to write about, Bob.

                    BOB
               Sure there are--and I've tried
               them all.  Plays, love stories,
               westerns, dog stories.  Huh, 
               now there was a good one, that 
               dog story all about--

                       SHIRLEY
                   (interrupting)
               But horror stories!  Why all the
               time horror stories?

                    BOB
               Shirley, I wrote for years 
               without selling a single word.

     Bob lets go of the wheel with his right arm and puts it around 
     Shirley, who leans closer against him.

                    BOB
               My monsters have done well for 
               me.  You think I'd give that up 
               just so I could write about 
               trees, or dogs, or daisies?  
               Huhuh--Daisies!  That's it, 
               I'll write about my creatures 
               who are pushing up the daisies.

     Shirley looks up at Bob and smiles.  He tilts his head down and 
     they kiss.
                        BOB
               Your puritan upbringing holds
               you back from my monsters, but
               it certainly doesn't hurt your
               art of kissing.
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               That's life.  My kisses are
               alive.
               
                    BOB
               Who's to say my monsters 
               aren't alive?

     CUT back to MEDIUM SHOT of Bob and Shirley

                    BOB
               All of my books are based on 
               fact, or legend.  Thats perhaps 
               why they're more interesting 
               and sell in the top spots.

                    SHIRLEY
               Well, fact or not, I don't 
               see how we're going to find 
               an ancient cemetery in these 
               mountains tonight.  I can't 
               see a thing!  Let's turn back.

                    BOB
               There's an old cemetery on
               this road. I've been there 
               before.

     LONG SHOT of car driving up a desert road with a sandy
     mountain in the background.

                    SHIRLEY
               I'm getting the jitters!  
               Let's turn back!

                    BOB
                  (reluctantly)
               Okay.

     Bob takes his arm from around Shirley and puts it back on the 
     wheel.

                    BOB
               Just as soon as I find a 
               place wide enough to turn 
               around.

               Not so fast!

     We hear sounds of tires squealing on the road.

               Not so fast!

     CLOSEUP - CAR PEDALS.  Bob steps hard on the brake,
     then pumps the brake repeatedly.

     CUT BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT - Bob and Shirley.  Shirley screams
     and hides her face with her hands.

     ZOOM IN on a high dirt bank at the roadside, then the screen
     swirls and spins quickly to suggest a dizzying automobile 
     crash.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

     Bob and Shirley are lying on their backs, unconcsious,
     on the ground.  The ground is covered by scattered leaves.  
     Misty fog swirls over them.
                    (beat)
     Shirley wakes up and sits upright groggily.  She looks 
     around, then looks down at Bob.  She moves toward him and
     cradles his head in her lap.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

     Cemetery is filled with fog.  We see a large stone throne
     framed by ornate columns, with an altar beneath it.  There 
     are tombstones in the background, and skulls and bones on 
     the ground.

     CAMERA PANS RIGHT across a small clearing to the MAUSOLEUM.

                    CRISWELL (VO)
               It is said on clear nights, 
               beneath     the cold light of the 
               moon, howl the dog and the wolf, 
               and creeping things crawl out
               of the slime.  It is then the 
               ghouls feast in all their
               radiance.

     The Mausoleum doors creak open on their own, and Criswell  
     quickly stalks out across the clearing, hiding his face 
     behind his long black cape which is held up with his bent 
     elbow against his face, in Dracula fashion.

                    CRISWELL (VO - Continuing)
               It is on nights like this most
               people prefer to steer clear of,
               uh, Burial Grounds. It is on 
               nights like this, that the 
               creatures are said to appear, 
               and to walk!

                                       CUT TO:

     MEDIUM SHOT, CRISWELL CLIMBING ONTO HIS THRONE
     
     Criswell walks up the steps to the altar, across the altar, 
     and then sits down on the stone seat.  He then slowly lowers 
     his cape from his face and regally looks off to the right 
     (at his cue card).             

                    CRISWELL
               The day is gone, the night is
               upon us, and the moon, which 
               controls all of the underworld, 
               once again shines...in radiant 
               contentment.
                    (beat)
               Come forth, come forth, o
               Princess of Darkness.

     Criswell repeatedly beckons slowly toward himself with his 
     right hand, staring across the clearing at the mausoleum.

     The PRINCESS OF DARKNESS is standing in front of the 
     Mausoleum.  She walks into the clearing with an entrancing 
     demeanor, her arms outstretched straight in front of her.  
     She is wearing a long black low-cut dress with long open 
     sleeves.  The sleeves are lined with red and hang down a
     couple feet from her wrists.  She walks slowly over toward
     Criswell's throne.

     The Princess of Darkness stands beside Criswells throne, 
     crosses her forearms in front of her chest, and bows toward 
     him.  He nods toward her.  She reaches out and places her 
     left hand on Criswell's right hand.
     
                    CRISWELL (VO)
               Time seems to stand still.  Not 
               so the ghouls, when a night of 
               Pleasure is at hand!

     Criswell continues to hold the Princess of Darkness's hand, 
     and she looks at him seductively.

                    CRISWELL
               If I am not pleased by tonight's
               entertainment, I shall banish 
               their souls to everlasting 
               damnation!

     The Princess of Darkness again crosses her arms in front of 
     her chest and slowly bows to Criswell.

     CUT TO shot of the FULL MOON with dramatic cymbals crashing,
     then back.
     
                    CRISWELL
               And who is to be first?

     The Princess of Darkness claps twice, summoning the first of 
     the night's entertainers.  These poor souls must dance for 
     Criswell's approval.  If he is pleased, they can continue to 
     entertain him for centuries, but if not, they will be banished 
     to everlasting damnation by the All-powerful Criswell.

     LONG SHOT OF THE CLEARING.  Huge flames rise from the ground 
     in front of the clearing.  The INDIAN GIRL enters the clearing 
     and begins to Dance.  She is wearing a red Native American-
     style dress and headband.

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               One who loved flames.  Her lover
               was killed by flames.  She died 
               in flames.

     The INDIAN GIRL DANCE begins.

     The Indian Girl dances around for awhile, then dances away 
     into the foggy background.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

     Bob slowly wakes up and sits up.  Bob and Shirley look 
     around.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

     The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the 
     mausoleum and begins to speak without moving her lips!  A 
     marvel of filmmaking art.

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS 
                   (out of sync with picture)
               One who prowls the lonely streets
               at night in life is bound to prowl 
               them in eternity.

     The STREET WALKER DANCE begins.  The STREET WALKER walks 
     into the clearing wearing a pink dress and purple feather 
     boa, and beckons with her finger as if to say, "Come here, 
     Criswell!"

EXT. WOODS.  NIGHT.

     At the car accident scene with Bob and Shirley, slow jazz 
     music is audible from the nearby festivities in the cemetery. 
     Bob and Shirley are still sitting on the ground, looking 
     toward the source of the music.

                    CRISWELL (VO)
               Ahh, the curiousity of youth...
               on the road to ruin!  May it 
               ever be so adventurous!
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               I'm so frightened.
                    
                    BOB
               Well we certainly can't stay 
               here. C'mon.     
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               Where?
                    
                    BOB
               In there.
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               It frightens me.
                    
                    BOB
               Silly, there's nothing in 
               there to be afraid of.
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               Then..then what's that music?
               
                    BOB
               That's what I want to find out.  
               We have to get help.
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               What help can we possibly find 
               in the cemetery at this time of 
               night?
                    
                    BOB
               Something's making that music.
               
                    SHIRLEY
               I'm not sure I care to find out
               what it is.
                    
                    BOB
               All right.  Don't worry, I'll
               be right beside you.
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               What help will that do if 
               something in there isn't dead?
                    
                    BOB
               Not dead?  In a cemetery?
               
                    SHIRLEY
               I can't imagine anything dead 
               playing that music.
                    
                    BOB
               Well, it's probably just the
               caretaker, and that's exactly 
               who we want to find.  They'll 
               have a telephone.  C'mon.
                    
     Bob helps Shirley up from the ground and leads her into the 
     thick bushes.

EXT. CEMETERY, NIGHT

     Criswell nods repeatedly, smiling at the dancer in approval.
     The Street Walker's clothes have suddenly disappeared.

     Bob and Shirley creep beneath the bushes, crouched down low.  
     They reach the edge of the clearing where Criswell and the 
     Princess of Darkness are watching the Street Walker Dance.
     
                    SHIRLEY
               Could it be some kind of 
               college initiation?
                    
                    BOB
               It's an initiation all right, 
               but not of a college as you 
               and I know them.  Nothing 
               alive looks like that!
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               Can't we get out of here?
                    
                    BOB
               I'm not sure...
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               What do you mean?
                    
                    BOB
               I'm not sure, myself. It's 
               just a feeling I've had 
               since the crash...Like I 
               feel a cold chill all over..
               ..Now this!

     The Street Walker dances with a Skeleton that is hanging by 
     the door of the mausoleum.

     The Street Walker dance ends.

                    CRISWELL
               I would see for approval, the
               one who in life worshipped 
               gold above all else.

     The Princess of Darkness points dramatically toward the
     mausoleum again to start off the next dance.

     The giants walk to the doors, now wearing red and white
     horizontal-striped miniskirts (or ancient egyptian garb?). 
     They pull the iron doors open slowly, and we see the GOLD 
     GIRL DANCER lying on her back on the altar inside.

                    SHIRLEY
                 (pointing toward the mausoleum)
               Look!
               
                    BOB
               Be careful!--They'll see you.

     The Gold Girl Dancer rises slowly and seductively from the 
     table, then stalkingly dances out into the clearing.  She is 
     wearing a metallic gold tunic-like dress.

     We see a shot of Bob and Shirley watching, and suddenly the 
     Gold Girl's dress has disappeared.

     The Gold Girl Dance continues.

                    CRISWELL
               Throw gold at her.
                    
     The giants pick up a bucket of gold doubloons and begin 
     slowly sprinkling them over the Gold Girl as she dances. 
     She sits on the ground and reaches for the falling coins.


                    CRISWELL
               More gold.
                    
     The giants continue dropping gold coins on the Gold Girl.  
     She picks up the gold coins, rubbing them over her body, 
     in ecstasy.

                    CRISWELL
                      (excitedly)
               More gold!

     The giants continue, to the delight of Criswell.  The Gold 
     girl tries to scoop all the scattered coins closer to her.
     
                    CRISWELL
                     (impatiently)
               More gold!

     The giants continue.  Criswell is thrilled, and begins to 
     LAUGH loudly.
     
                    CRISWELL
                   (to the Princess)
               For all eternity, she shall 
               have gold.

     The Princess of Darkness laughs in acknowledgement, then 
     claps her hands twice, commanding the Giants to finish the
     ceremony.
     
     The Giants walk toward the Gold Girl, who is still on the 
     ground playing with the gold coins and rubbing them on her 
     body.  The giants pick up the Gold Girl, who resists, trying 
     to maintain contact with the gold.  She reaches for it as 
     they lift her up.
     
     CLOSEUP of a BUBBLING GIANT CAULDRON full of a substance that 
     is supposed to look like gold.
     
     The Giants dip the Gold Girl feet first into the cauldron,
     submerging her entire body.
     
     A few seconds later, the giants lift the Gold Girl out of the 
     cauldron.  Her body is now entirely gilded, and she is stiff. 
     They lift her onto their shoulders, carrying her like a board, 
     walking in front of Criswell's throne, then back into the 
     mausoleum, laying her body on the altar.
     
     We see Bob and Shirley, looking dismayed.
     
                    CRISWELL (VO)
               And both couldn't help but 
               remember a line from one of 
               Bob's stories:  "A sudden wind 
               howls.  The night things are 
               all about me.  Every shadow, a
               beckoning invitation...to 
               disaster.  I know I should 
               think of other things, of 
               pleasant things, but I can't. 
               How can I think of other things, 
               of pleasant things, when I am 
               in a place surrounded by 
               shadows and objects, which can 
               take any shape, here in the 
               darkness...Any shape my mind 
               can conceive."

     Deep in the woods, we see THE WOLF MAN and THE MUMMY, walking 
     quickly.

     Suddenly, Bob and Shirley are grabbed from behind by the WOLF 
     MAN and the MUMMY.  The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and 
     Shirley over to the clearing near Criswell's throne.
     
     The Princess of Darkness is now seated at Criswell's right 
     side with him on his throne.
     
                    CRISWELL
               Bring 'em in!

     The Princess of Darkness stands and walks to the end of the 
     altar below Criswell's throne, then sits on the lower seat at 
     the end of the altar and crosses her legs.

     The Wolf Man and The Mummy drag Bob and Shirley over to the 
     center of the clearing to face Criswell, The Sole Ruler of 
     the Dark World.
     
                    CRISWELL
               They are live ones?
                    
                    THE MUMMY
              (with audible tape hiss added)
               Yes, Master.
               
                    CRISWELL
               Live ones where only the dead 
               should be?
                    
                    THE MUMMY
               Yes, Master, and we caught 
               them, him and me.
                    
     The Mummy motions toward the Wolf Man.

                    THE WOLF MAN
               WWWWOOOOOOAAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHAHAAAA!!!

                    CRISWELL
               You shall both be rewarded.
                     (To Princess)
               My Dear Empress of the Night, 
               put these intruders to the 
               test.
     
     Medium Shot of Princess of Darkness.  (Suddenly the Princess 
     of  Darkness is beside the throne again, several feet from the 
     seat at the foot of the altar)
               
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               But they are not yet one of us.
                    
                    CRISWELL
                       (happily)
               A situation easily remedied.
                    
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               Tie them that they may watch.

     CUT back to long shot of the entire throne and throne altar. 
     The Princess of     Darkness is now seated again at the end of 
     the altar.

     The Wolf Man and The Mummy tie Bob and Shirley to very tall 
     grave stones.
     
     CUT to medium-close shot of Princess of Darkness, whose chest 
     is heaving excitedly as she grips the handle of the long 
     sacrificial dagger tucked into the belt at her waist.
     
                    SHIRLEY
                 (desperately, to Criswell)
               Fiend!  Fiend!
               
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               To love the cat, is to be 
               the cat!
     
     Criswell motions toward The Princess of Darkness, who then 
     walks back up onto the altar and then sits down beside 
     Criswell again.
          
     The CAT GIRL DANCE begins.

     
     
                    CRISWELL
                     (jovially)
               A pussycat is born to be 
               whipped.

     The Cat Girl Dance ends.

                    CRISWELL
                     (excitedly)
               It will please me very much 
               to see the Slave Girl with 
               her tortures!

     CUT TO interior of the stone mausoleum.  The Ancient Egyptian 
     SLAVE GIRL is chained from her wrists to a high hook on the 
     wall.  One of the "giants" pretends to whip her with a cat 
     o' nine tails.

     CUT back to CRISWELL.

                    CRISWELL
                     (excitedly)
               Torture! Torture!  It 
               pleasures me!

     The slave girl pulls with all her might and the chains 
     suddenly pop off the hook.  She then pushes the iron doors 
     open and dances out into the clearing.

     The Slave Dance concludes.

                    SHIRLEY
               I'm so frightened.

                    BOB
               You've got a right to be.  
               We're trapped by a bunch of 
               fiends.

                    SHIRLEY
               Those creatures..!

                    BOB
               Don't let them hear you.

                    SHIRLEY
               What can we do?

                    BOB
               I don't know.  I just don't 
               know. But don't give up.  
               We're not finished yet.

     Shirley closes her eyes and sighs.

                    BOB
               Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic 
               won't do us any good!  Let 
               me think. We've got to
               stall for time.

                    SHIRLEY
               I'm afraid I'll faint.

                    BOB
               Whatever you do, don't do 
               that.

     The Camera zooms back and we see that the Wolf Man and The
     Mummy are hiding behind Bob and Shirley.  The Wolf Man has 
     his hand up to his ear so he can hear what Bob and Shirley 
     are saying.

     The Wolf Man and The Mummy then creep over toward Criswell's 
     throne.

     The Wolf Man whispers into The Princess of Darkness's ear while
     The Mummy and Criswell watch.

     The Princess of Darkness gets up from the throne and walks over 
     to Shirley.  Shirley grimaces.  The Princess of Darkness 
     unbuttons Shirley's blouse, then marks Shirley's abdomen with 
     a red (blood?) cross using her long sharp fingernail.

     Shirley screams.

     The Princess of Darkness pulls her long dagger out of her belt
     and raises it, staring into Shirley's eyes.  Suddenly, Criswell
     yells:

                    CRISWELL
               HOLD!

     The Princess of Darkness pauses and looks back at Criswell.

                    CRISWELL
               Let her continue to learn.  
               The time is not yet right 
               that they should join with 
               us.

     The Princess of Darkness reluctantly puts her dagger back in 
     her belt and tucks Shirley's blouse back in.

     The Princess of Darkness walks back to Criswell's throne.  
     He pulls a human skull out from behind his seat.

                    CRISWELL
               ...And what is this?

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               A symbol, Master.

                    CRISWELL
               What kind of symbol?

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               She loved the bull ring 
               and the matador.  She 
               danced to their destruction.
               Now she dances to her own 
               destruction.  Her dance is
               of skulls.

     The Princess of Darkness takes the skull from Criswell and 
     throws it dramatically into the clearing.

     The MEXICAN DANCE (SKULL DANCE) ensues.

                    CRISWELL
               She came to us on the Day of 
               the Dead.

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               El Dia De Los Muertos...A
               celebration in her country.

                    CRISWELL                    
               Her dance has pleased me.

     The Princess of Darkness snaps her fingers, starting the 
     HAWAIIAN DANCE (SNAKE DANCE).

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               With the loss of her lover, 
               this one cast herself into 
               the Volcano's fire.

     A couple times during the dance, there are abrupt cuts to 
     STOCK FOOTAGE of a rattlesnake in a bright daylight shot in 
     tall dry grass.  (Looks like it was from a documentary)

                    CRISWELL
               She was?

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               As I said, a worshipper of 
               snakes, and of smoke, and 
               flames.

                    CRISWELL
               Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               It would seem so, Master.

     Hawaiian Dance continues, then cut to The Mummy and The Wolf 
     Man.
     
                    THE MUMMY
               I don't like snakes.  I remember 
               the one Cleopatra used.  Cute 
               little rascal until it flicked
               out that red tongue, and those 
               two sharp fangs.  You'd never 
               think such a little thing
               packed such a big wallop.
                         
                    THE WOLF MAN
               Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
                         
                    THE MUMMY
               Hurt her?  Hell, it killed her!
               
                    THE WOLF MAN
                      (in agreement)
               Aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn.     

     Hawaiian/Snake Girl continues to dance.
     
                    THE MUMMY
               We had lots of snakes in my 
               ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky
               things.
                    
                    THE WOLF MAN
               Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn.
               AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
                    
                    THE MUMMY
               When I was alive, they were the
               things nightmares were made of.
                    
                    THE WOLF MAN
               Aaarrrgggaahh.
     
     The Hawaiian Dance ends.
                    
                    CRISWELL
               She pleases me.  Permit her to 
               live in the World of the Snakes.
                  (audible cue card flip)
          
                    CRISWELL
     (continuing, after finding his place on the next cue card)
               Now, I will talk...to The 
               Wolf Man...and The Mummy.

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               As you wish, Master

     The Princess of Darkness motions for The Wolf Man and The Mummy 
     to come.
                    
                    THE MUMMY     
               He wants us.
               
                    THE WOLF MAN
               Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
                    
                    THE MUMMY
               What do you suppose for?
                    
                    THE WOLF MAN
               Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
                    
                    THE MUMMY
               Did you do something to get 
               us into trouble again?
                    
                    THE WOLF MAN
               Aannnnaahhnn.
               
                    THE MUMMY
               Did you howl off-key at 
               the moon again?
                    
                    THE WOLF MAN
               Aannnnaahhnn.

                    THE MUMMY
               I can't remember doing 
               anything wrong either.

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               COME!
                    
                    THE MUMMY
               We better go before we 
               make him mad.

     The Wolf Man and The Mummy walk over to Criswell's Throne.

                    THE MUMMY
                     (apprehensively)
               We are your servants, Master.

     The Wolf Man bows to Criswell.

                    CRISWELL
               Of course you are.

     The Wolf Man and the Mummy crouch in fear as they face Criswell.

                    THE MUMMY
               Have we in some way made 
               you angry, Master?

                    CRISWELL
               You know better than that.

                    THE MUMMY
               We don't know of anything, 
               Master...

                    CRISWELL
               Then why do you shake so?

                    THE MUMMY
               It's not often an Emperor 
               like you calls on creatures 
               like us.

                    CRISWELL
               Well rest easy, I'm not 
               angry with either of you.

                    THE MUMMY
                    (relieved)
               Aaaahhhh.

     The Mummy Sighs in relief and the Wolf Man nods.

                    THE MUMMY
               Then it is some service you 
               desire of us.

                    CRISWELL
               You are the keepers of the 
               Damned.  You two know them all.  
               And I am tired of this usual 
               type of entertainment.
               I want...a decided change.

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               The moon!...is soon gone!
               
     The Princess of Darkness points up at the full moon.

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               There is little time left for 
               the remainder of the evening's 
               pleasures.
               
     The Princess of Darkness gets up from the seat at the end of 
     the altar and walks around beside Criswell's throne.

                    CRISWELL
               Yes, yes yes I know all that.

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               At the first sight of the 
               morning sun's rays, we must 
               be gone.

                    CRISWELL
               I suppose most of the others 
               will have to wait for their 
               judgement until after the next 
               full moon.

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               It would seem so, Master

                    CRISWELL
               Ahh, but I declare there is 
               still time for something.

                    THE MUMMY
               There are one or two which 
               should complement the night's 
               entertainment, Master

                    CRISWELL
               Ahh, good.  Then I will 
               see them.  Dismiss the rest.

                    THE MUMMY
               Yes, sir, Master.

     Bob's hands are wiggling, trying to loosen the rope binding 
     his wrists behind his back around the stone column.
     
                    BOB
               The ropes are coming loose.
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               Be careful!
                    
                    BOB
               I am--It's our only chance.
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               Nothing is worth your life.
                    
                    BOB
               My guess is if we don't 
               take the chance pretty soon,
               we're not going to have much
               life left anyway.
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               I'm frightened.  I'm so 
               frightened.
                    
                    BOB
               Hold on just a little 
               longer, Shirley.
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               Be careful, oh please be 
               careful.  We'll never get 
               out of here alive, I know 
               it.  I just feel it.
                    
                    BOB
               You do?
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               Yes I feel it in my bones.
               
                    BOB
               You're talking nonsense.
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               Oh, no I'm not.  These 
               heathens probably have 
               an open grave for us.
               
                    BOB
               They wouldn't dare put 
               us in the same grave--
               or would they?
               
                    SHIRLEY
               I should hope not.  I 
               hate you!
               
                    BOB
               That sudden?
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't
               for you we wouldn't be hunting 
               for an old cemetery on a 
               night like this.  It's all
               your fault.
               
                    BOB
                    (dejected)
               ...And I thought you loved me.
               
                    
     The Princess of Darkness is leaning over, covering her mouth 
     and whispering into Criswell's ear, looking over her hand back 
     at Shirley.
                    
                    CRISWELL
               Not yet.  I perhaps have other 
               plans for such a pretty one.  
               No matter, I will tell you when 
               and if you may have her.

     The Princess of Darkness crosses her forearms and bows to 
     Criswell.
               
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               The Wolf Man informs me that 
               the next one is the woman who 
               murdered her husband on their 
               wedding night.  Now she dances
               with his skeleton.
               
     The SKELETON DANCE begins.

     The SKELETON DANCE GIRL, wearing a white dress and long 
     wedding veil, comes into the clearing with a skeleton.  She 
     dances with the skeleton, then dances in the clearing for 
     Criswell.

     The Skeleton Dance concludes.
                    
                    CRISWELL
                     (to Shirley)
               Have you not enjoyed the 
               evening's festivities?
                    
     Shirley is silent and looks downward.
     
                    CRISWELL
               Ahh, that will soon change 
               when you become one of us!

     The Wolf Man leans back and howls.  (He tilts his head back so
     far his fake rubber wolfman mask comes up and you can see his 
     skin at the bottom of his neck)
                    
                    THE WOLF MAN
               WWAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAHHGGGGHHHAAAA-
               AAAAAAAAAHHGGGGGHHHHHHHhhhhhh!
                    
                    CRISWELL
               It would seem that The 
               Wolf Man would have you 
               for his own!
               
                    SHIRLEY
               AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
               
                    CRISWELL
               I have promised both The 
               Wolf Man and The Mummy a 
               reward.  It could be that
               you are that reward.
               
                    SHIRLEY
               AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
               
                    CRISWELL
               You need not worry...Not just 
               now, anyway.
                    
                    BOB
               Leave her alone, you fiend!
               
                    CRISWELL
               Fiend is it!  You will not 
               be so fortunate.  Your 
               existence will cease within 
               moments.  No one wishes to 
               see a man dance...
                  (looking at Shirley)
               And you, my dear, will entertain 
               for centuries to come.
               
                    BOB
               If I could get my hands on 
               you...
               
                    CRISWELL
               ..Oh, You could do nothing!
                   (to Shirley)
               I can save you much pain.
               
                    BOB
               Leave her alone, I tell you!
               
                    CRISWELL
                   (to Shirley)
               I do not joke in my proposal.
               
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               She is to be mine!  It is so
               spoken!
               
                    CRISWELL
               The Princess of Darkness would 
               have you for her own to join us 
               through extreme pain.
                     (beat)
               Yet I am inclined for one as 
               lovely as you, to be more lenient. 
               I have but to touch you with my 
               finger, and it would mean the end 
               of you, all over, quickly and 
               painlessly...
               
                    SHIRLEY
               No. No! No!
               
                    CRISWELL
               I repulse you?  Very well.  It
               seems you have chosen your own 
               fate. Live with it!  I should 
               say die with it!

     Bob looks down somberly, then looks over at Shirley.

                    BOB
               I've got the ropes loose now.  
               I've got my hands free.  Be 
               careful--Don't change your 
               expression too much.  They 
               must not catch on.
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               What can we do against them?
               
                    BOB
               I don't know, yet.  We'll 
               just have to watch our chance.  
               When it comes I'll know what 
               to do--I hope I'll know what
               to do.
                    
                    SHIRLEY
               I still don't know what ever
               made me go steady with a 
               crackpot writer like you.
                    
                    BOB
               All right.  Put it on heavy.
               
                    SHIRLEY
               My old boyfriend Tommy would 
               never have gotten me in a 
               mess like this.  At least he's 
               got brains.
               
                    BOB
               Him!  I'll bet he sleeps 
               with all the lights on.

                    SHIRLEY
               Maybe so.

                    THE MUMMY
               I could make her another 
               Cleopatra...

                    THE WOLF MAN
               Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!

                    THE MUMMY
               Without the snake, of 
               course.          

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
                    (impatiently)
               Well?

                    CRISWELL
               Ahh, she will be yours.

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
                    (impatiently)
               When!?
     
                    CRISWELL
               At your discretion...But 
               first, I desire more 
               entertainment.

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               The moon is almost gone!
               
                    CRISWELL
               Ahh, there is yet time.
               
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               At the first sight of the 
               morning's rays' light...
                    
                    CRISWELL
                  (getting annoyed)
               I know the laws of the night.  
               I state there is still time 
               for yet another.

                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
                    (forcefully)
               I would have time for my 
               own pleasures!
               
                    CRISWELL
                    (angrily)
               Your own pleasure comes only 
               after mine, when I desire it.  
               I am the Sole Ruler of the 
               Dark World.  There is no one 
               to challenge my authority here.  
               My word is the law--all powerful.  
               No one is to challenge that 
               authority, no one!.  Is that 
               understood?  It is my command.
               
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               I understand, Master
               
                    CRISWELL
               Then see that it does not 
               happen again, in the penalty of 
               Everlasting Despair.  Now are 
               there others?
                    
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               There are others.
                    
                    CRISWELL
               Well then let us proceed.
                    
     The Princess of Darkness snaps her fingers three times, 
     summoning the Zombie Dance Girl.
     
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               She lived as a zombie in life, 
               so she will remain forever a 
               zombie in death.

     The ZOMBIE DANCE GIRL dances.
               
                    BOB
               Easy, Shirley.  Easy!

     The Zombie Dance concludes.
                    
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               The moon sinks lower into the 
               hills!  We must hurry to the 
               finish.
               
                    CRISWELL
               I will decide the conclusion.
                    
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
                    (impatiently)
               You had the mummy cancel all 
               the others scheduled for this 
               session.
                    
                    CRISWELL
                    (interrupting)
               Then cancel my order.
                    
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               The moon is almost gone!
               
                    CRISWELL
               There is yet time.  Don't 
               you want your own pleasure?
                    
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               Oh, if there is only time!
                    
                    CRISWELL
               Hahh, there is always time...
               All in good time...there is 
               always time.  You shall 
               have your pleasure.  THAT...
               I decree
                    
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
                    (looking at Shirley)
               All others were but infinitessimal 
               bits of fluff, compared to her
                    (toward the Dancer)
               This one would have died for
               feathers, furs, and fluff...and 
               so she did!

     The FLUFF DANCE Girl dances for approval.
     
     The Fluff Dance ends.
     
     Criswell looks over at the Princess of Darkness.
                    CRISWELL
               The time...is short.
                    
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               For what!?!
                    
                    CRISWELL
               Your pleasures of course!
                    
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               You mean...!
                    
                    CRISWELL
               You may take her now.
                    
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               Is there time?
                    
                    CRISWELL
               You better hope there is.
                    
                    PRINCESS OF DARKNESS
               Thank you, Master!  Thank 
               you.
                    
                    CRISWELL
               Now hurry, hurry.  I will 
               watch!  Your desires may be 
               my pleasure also...Our fitting 
               climax to an evening's enter-
               tainment.  You must...hurry 
               now.
               
     The Princess of Darkness begins ceremoniously dancing with 
     her long sacrificial dagger, slowly moving toward shirley, 
     gazing back at Criswell seductively.  She finally gets to 
     Shirley and cuts the button off of Shirley's shirt, which 
     was so tight it was about to burst open anyway.  She unsnaps 
     the front of Shirley's bra.
     
     Bob sees his chance and makes his attempt at a "move," merely
     stepping forward.  He is instantly hammer-fisted on the back 
     of the neck by The Wolf Man, and falls down unconscious.
     
     The Princess of Darkness raises her long dagger high above 
     Shirley's head.  But suddenly, the sun rises (it is already 
     high overhead), and the night creatures lose their power.  The 
     Princess of Darkness clings to Shirley's arm, as she slowly 
     sinks down to the ground, losing all strength.
     
     The Camera pans around, showing Shirley and Bob's faces, then 
     back to the ghouls, all of whom have turned to steaming 
     skeletons.  Only their clothing and bones remain.
     
     Quick Zoom in on Criswell's throne.  Criswell's steaming 
     skeleton still sits, surveying the cemetery, wearing his cape.

                                   FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN.

EXT. WOODS - MORNING

     At the clearing in the woods near the car wreck, Bob and 
     Shirley are lying on their backs on the ground, just as they 
     were after the crash, before they got up to investigate the 
     strange music that led them to the ghouls.

     There are two DOCTORS examining Bob and Shirley.

     In the foreground, we see a REPORTER's shoulder and hands.  
     He is writing down details of the accident in a small paper 
     pad.

                    DOCTOR #1
               Easy, Miss, everything's 
               gonna be alright.

                    SHIRLEY
               Bob?  Bob?

                    DOCTOR #1
               He's right here beside you. 
               He'll be alright too.

     The reporter walks around and crouches beside Shirley and 
     DOCTOR #1, and continues writing in his pad.

     A Newspaper PHOTOGRAPHER crouches in the foreground to get a 
     shot of the accident scene and victims.

                    SHIRLEY
               Where are they, where did 
               they go? They tried to kill 
               me.

                    DOCTOR #2
               What's this you say?  Who 
               was going to kill you?

                    SHIRLEY
               The ghouls--they all turned 
               into skeletons.
               
                    DOCTOR #2
               Take it easy, Miss.
               
                    DOCTOR #1
               What she needs is a good
               rest.

                    SHIRLEY
               It's true, I tell you, it's 
               true!  They all turned into 
               skeletons.  She-she cut me 
               here.
     
     Shirley points to her abdomen where The Princess of Darkness 
     had made the X with her fingernail.
     
     NURSE crouches down and pulls out a length of medical tape, 
     then hands it to the doctor.  She cuts another piece of
     tape, but the Doctors don't realize this and leave her
     hanging...
               
                    DOCTOR #1
               Probably was bruised in the 
               crash.
               
                    DOCTOR #2
               You know, you two were very 
               lucky.

                    SHIRLEY
               I love you Bob. I really do.  
               Forgive me?

                    BOB
               There's nothing to forgive. 
               It was all a dream.

                    SHIRLEY
               You love me then?

                    BOB
               Of course I do.

     The doctors put Shirley onto a stretcher while the photographer 
     takes more pictures.  They put her into the back of an 
     ambulance.

     Then after the doctor listens to Bob's neck with a stethoscope, 
     Bob just gets up and walks into the back of the ambulance.

                    CRISWELL (VO)
               As it is with all the Night 
               People, they are destroyed 
               by the first rays of the sun. 
               But upon the first appearance
               of the deep shadows of the 
               night, and when the moon is 
               full, they will return, to 
               rejoice...in their evil lust, 
               and take back with them any 
               mortal who might happen along.
                                   CUT TO:

INT. MAUSOLEUM, MORNING.

     Criswell is back in his coffin, sitting upright.
     
                    CRISWELL
               Yes, they were lucky, those two 
               young people...May you be so 
               lucky...But do not trust to 
               luck, at the full of the moon, 
               when the night is dark...Make 
               a wide path around the unholy 
               grounds...of the Night People.
               Who can say that we do not
               exist-Can you?
               
               But now, we return to our 
               graves, and you
                 (pointing at audience) 
               may join us soon!
               
     Criswell reclines back into his coffin, crossing his arms, and 
     returning to the slumber of the undead.



THE END.
