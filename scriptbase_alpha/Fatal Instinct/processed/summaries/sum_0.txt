A spoof of the late 80s and early 90s suspense thrillers and murder mysteries, including Basic Instinct, Sleeping With The Enemy, Cape Fear and others.
A cop/attorney (yes he's both) is seduced by a woman while his wife is having an affair with a mechanic.
Lots of other sublots and visual gags in the style of Naked Gun.
