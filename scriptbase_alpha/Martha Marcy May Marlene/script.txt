          EXT. FARM - DAY
                         
          It is a hot summer day. A large run down farm house,
          several sheds, a red roof barn and a decrepid silo sit
          between fields of dry, uncut grass, in a serene isolated
          valley.
                         
          TWO MEN tack together a broken fence that encloses an
          overgrown paddock.
                         
          THREE WOMEN work in a vegetable garden.
                         
          TWO WOMEN hang wet clothes on a clothes line.
                         
          TWO MEN work in a cluttered garage on an old car.
                         
          FOUR WOMEN sit in a circle on a broken down, buckling
          front porch. One woman breast feeds a new born. The
          others knit a large blanket.
                         
          TWO WOMEN and TWO MEN swim naked in a swimming hole.
                         
          A MAN in his forties sits alone in a room reading.
                         
          A MAN chops wood.
                         
          A bare foot TODDLER plays alone in the driveway.
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY
                         
          A large room with unfinished wood walls has several
          blankets and pillows laid out like beds on the floor.
                         
          TWO WOMEN are in the kitchen preparing food.
                         
          MARTHA, sets a table for eight. Martha is beautiful but
          appears run down. She is 24 years old but her weathered
          face makes her look older. A bell rings off screen.
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - EVENING
                         
          The men sit around a table eating dinner.
                         
          One man sits at the head of the table, this is PATRICK.
          Patrick is older than the other men. To his right is
          WATTS, a man in his early twenties with a greasy patchy
          beard.
           2.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The women are scattered around the kitchen waiting. The
          men finish dinner, pass through the kitchen and walk
          outside.
                         
          The women file into the dining room, clear the men's
          dishes, put more chairs around the table, and bring out a
          new serving of food.
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          The women sit around the table eating very small portions
          of low protein food. Katie sits at the head of the table.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
                         
          The kitchen is filled with dishes.
                         
          TWO BABIES sleep next to each other in an old broken
          crib. A teenage girl sleeps on the floor next to the
          crib.
                         
          People are strewn all over the house sleeping. Suddenly,
          a figure passes quickly through frame.
                         
                         
          EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Martha walks out the front door, across the porch, and up
          the driveway. She carries a small bag.
                         
          Her pace becomes increasingly faster. She looks back to
          see a teenage girl, SARAH, standing in the window
          watching.
                         
          Martha turns and walks faster, heading straight for the
          woods. As she gets to the edge of the trees she begins
          to run.
                         
          SLOW ZOOM: MARTHA DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK WOODS.
                         
          Off screen, the house DOOR SLAMS SHUT. A MAN urgently
          yells out: "MARCY MAY"
                         
          The camera holds on the trees shaking gently in the wind.
          For a moment everything is quiet.
           3.
                         
                         
          Suddenly, A MAN and TWO WOMEN enter frame and run into
          the woods, chasing after Martha.
                         
                         
          EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The woods are dark. Martha runs as fast as she can. She
          hears the MAN's voice calling her from a distance. A man
          and two women are chasing her.
                         
          Martha arrives at a steep heavily wooded hill. She keeps
          running at full speed, then slips, falls, and rolls.
                         
          Martha ducks behind a fallen tree and looks back to see
          the group arrive at the ridge to survey the woods and
          begin their descent.
                         
          Martha holds still, listening as the people chasing her
          pass by.
                         
                         
          EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - DAY
                         
          Martha uses a pay phone at a diner. She dials and waits.
          She is struck by the voice that answers, she transforms
          from being a zombie to being flooded with emotion.
                         
                          LUCY
           Hello. Hello?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Hi!
                         
                          LUCY
           Martha?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           Oh my god! Where are you?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm not sure. Upstate I think.
                         
                          LUCY
           You're in New York?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I think. Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           When did you get back?
           4.
                         
                         
                         
          Martha doesn't know what to say, she bursts into tears.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Martha? What's wrong? What's happened?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't know. I should go back.
                         
                          LUCY
           Go back where?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I have to go, I can't stay gone.
                         
                          LUCY
           No, no, no. Don't go. What are you
           talking about?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Sorry for calling.
                         
                          LUCY
           Martha! Don't hang up. Please! Do not
           hang up.
                          (BEAT)
           Do you want me to come get you?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I can't wait that long.
                         
                          LUCY
           What do you mean? Tell me where you are
           and I'll come right now.
                         
                          MARTHA
           It's okay, you don't have to-
                         
                          LUCY
           I want to see you Martha. Please.
                         
          Martha thinks for a moment.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Martha!
                         
                         
          INT. DINER - DAY
                         
          Martha sits alone in a booth hunched over a grilled
          cheese sandwich and french fries. She devours the food
          like she hasn't eaten in days.
           5.
                         
                         
                         
          The entrance bell rings. Martha turns around and
          cautiously peers over the booth. A FAMILY walks in. They
          are seated. Martha returns to eating.
                         
           MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
           Marcy May?
                         
          It is Watts. His voice paralyzes her.
                         
                          WATTS
           What are you doin'?
                         
          Martha stops eating. He slides into the booth and sits
          across from her.
                         
          Watts reaches over and takes some french fries. He eats
          them slowly, enjoying every bite. She can't look at him.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           We were worried about you.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm fine.
                         
                          WATTS
           Patrick's worried about you.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I just wanted to come into town.
                         
                          WATTS
           I could've brought you.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I wanted to walk.
                         
                          WATTS
           Through the woods?
                         
                          WAITRESS
                          (TO WATTS)
           Can I get you something?
                         
                          WATTS
           No.
                         
                          WAITRESS
                          (TO MARTHA)
           You done?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
           6.
                         
                         
                         
          The waitress goes to take Martha's plate. Watts puts his
          hand out to stop her.
                         
                          WATTS
                          (TO MARTHA)
           You not gonna eat that?
                         
          Watts takes the half grilled cheese sandwich and stuffs
          it into his mouth. The waitress clears the plate.
                         
          Watts takes Martha's napkin and wipes the grease from his
          hands and mouth while he chews.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           You ready to go?
                         
          Martha doesn't respond.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           Come on!
                         
                          MARTHA
           Not right now.
                         
                          WATTS
           No?
                         
          The waitress drops the check on the table.
                         
          Watts stares at Martha for another moment before reaching
          into his pocket to pull out a mess of small papers. He
          sorts through them and separates a $20 bill. He stuffs
          the rest of the papers back into his pocket. He grabs her
          hand, places the money in her palm and grips it closed.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           I'll get this.
                         
          He lets go. Her hand goes limp and the money falls on the
          table. She does not look at him. He leans in and forces
          eye contact with her.
                         
          Watts, growing increasingly tense, stands up and glances
          around the diner. It is very busy. He does not want to
          make a scene in front of all these people.
                         
          He leans down and kisses Martha on the cheek. She doesn't
          kiss back. He holds his forehead to her forehead until
          she reacts. She reluctantly kisses him on the lips.
                         
          Martha watches him walk outside. As soon as his back is
          turned, she gets up, runs through the diner, and suddenly
          cuts through the kitchen.
           7.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          EXT. BUS STOP - LATER
                         
          Martha sits on the ground hiding between two benches at
          an empty bus stop. She does not look well. She turns and
          vomits behind the bench.
                         
                         
          EXT. BUS STOP - LATER
                         
          Martha hides between two parked buses. She watches a
          BLACK BMW pull into the parking lot. LUCY, a well dressed
          woman in her early 30's, gets out of the car. Martha
          walks towards Lucy. Lucy rushes over and hugs Martha.
                         
                         
          INT. LUCY'S CAR - DAY
                         
          Martha, wrapped in Lucy's sweater, leans her head against
          the window watching the road behind her in the side view
          mirror.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's nice to see you.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You too.
                         
          Lucy notices that Martha's left ear is bruised.
                         
                          LUCY
           What's going on?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Not much.
                         
                          LUCY
           You alright?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           You sure?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           You were pretty upset on the phone.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Sorry. I over reacted.
           8.
                         
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           To what?
                         
          Martha thinks.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           What happened?
                         
                          MARTHA
           We had a fight.
                         
                          LUCY
           Who?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Me and this guy.
                         
                          LUCY
           Who?
                         
          Martha doesn't answer.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Your boyfriend?
                         
          Martha nods.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Did he hurt you?
                         
                          MARTHA
           No!
                         
                          LUCY
           Are you sure?
                         
                          MARTHA
           No. I'm fine.
                         
          Lucy is skeptical.
                         
                          LUCY
           Did you guys break up?
                         
          Martha nods.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           How long were you together?
                         
                          MARTHA
           A while.
           9.
                         
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           How long?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't know. Maybe a year, maybe more or
           less.
                         
                          LUCY
           And you were here the whole time?
                         
          Martha nods.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           You've been back in New York for over a
           year and you haven't called me?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Lucy is upset but manages to remain calm.
                         
                          LUCY
           Well, I'm glad you're here now.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - EVENING
                         
          Lucy makes the bed. Martha enters the room wrapped in a
          towel. Her hair drips on the floor.
                         
                          LUCY
           I made you some tea.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Thanks.
                         
          Lucy takes a small hand towel and dries Martha's hair.
                         
                          LUCY
           Ted should be up from the city soon.
           He'll cook us some dinner.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm pretty tired, is it okay if I just go
           to bed?
                         
                          LUCY
           Of course.
                          (BEAT)
           Get some sleep, you'll be as good as new
           tomorrow.
           10.
                         
                         
                         
          Lucy leaves. Martha gets under the sheets wrapped in her
          wet towel.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Lucy sits at the kitchen table with a glass of RED WINE.
          The front door opens. She puts on a smile as TED enters.
          He speaks with a BRITISH ACCENT. He sets down his bag and
          gives her a hug and a kiss.
                         
                          TED
           Well?
                         
                          LUCY
           She seems okay.
                         
                          TED
           What did she say?
                         
                          LUCY
           Not much, she's pretty tired.
                         
                          TED
           Where's she been?
                         
                          LUCY
           She had some boyfriend, they were living
           in the Catskills.
                         
                          TED
           What?
                         
                          LUCY
           It's okay.
                         
                          TED
           Not really Lucy.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's fine. She's here now.
                         
          Ted keeps his comments to himself.
                         
                          TED

                          LUCY
                          (LAUGHING)
           I don't know.

                          TED
           I told you she was fine. You spend all
           that time worrying.
                         
          Ted kisses her on the forehead and walks to the liquor
          cabinet and pours a scotch.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          The house is completely dark. Martha finds her way
          through the hallway and into the kitchen. She drinks
          water from the faucet with an insatiable thirst.
                         
          The kitchen has large windows, through which a bright
          spot light, lights the porch but pitch black darkness is
          beyond that. Martha is scared to look outside. She forces
          herself to slowly turn and look. She puts her head down
          and quickly returns to her room.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE/MARTHA'S BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          Martha is wrapped in a wet towel sleeping on the floor.
                         
                          LUCY
           Martha? Why are you on the floor?
                         
          Martha does not know where she is. A moment passes before
          she starts to come to.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm sorry.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's okay, you were in a deep sleep. Come
           have some breakfast.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY
                         
          Lucy and Ted eat at the kitchen table. Martha enters.
                         
                          TED

           Great to finally meet you. You sleep
           alright?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           How do you like the house?
                         
                          TED
           It's just a rental.
                         
                          LUCY
           Well I love it.
                         
          Lucy puts some eggs on a plate for Martha.
                         
                          MARTHA
           It's nice. I didn't know there was a
           lake.
                         
                          LUCY
           Yeah. Do you still like to swim?
                         
                          MARTHA
           You don't live in the city anymore?
                         
                          LUCY
           We do. This is for weekends and holidays.
                         
          Ted and Lucy eat, Martha takes miniscule bites.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Ted's finishing a new building down town
           and when it's done we're taking one of
           the new apartments. You want to see
           pictures?
                         
          Lucy gets up from the table and walks to another room.
          Martha sniffs her food. Ted doesn't notice.

          Lucy re-enters with her digital camera.
                         
                          LUCY
           This is the view, the interiors are
           obviously not finished. It's nice right?

           Okay, sorry, no more work talk.
                         
          Lucy notices that Martha isn't eating.

           It's okay, I can fix you something later.
                         
          Martha, feeling on the spot, forces down a big bite.

          Martha sits cross legged on a sun bed looking out to the
          lake. Ted naps while Lucy sun bathes reading THE MOTHER
          OF ALL BABY BOOKS.

           Yesterday.
                         
          Lucy is confused. She tries to make sense of the
          question.
                         
                          LUCY

           Just wondered.
                         
          Lucy goes back to reading. Martha lies down and stares at
          the sky. A light banging sound starts to echo over the
          lake.

          THE SOUND IS THE SAME AS THE LAKE: A light breeze in the
          trees and the water gently hitting the dock.
                         
          Patrick and two men build a fence.

          Martha lies in the open field smoking cigarettes with
          ZOE, a girl in her early twenties.
                         
          Martha is younger, more energetic and confident. They are
          laughing and talking when Zoe notices Patrick walking
          towards them.
                         
                          ZOE
           Put out your cigarette.

           Just do it.
                         
          They put out their cigarettes. Zoe buries them in the
          grass. Patrick approaches them.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Is that him?

           It's as much yours as it is mine.
                         
          He glances at her legs, then back up to her face. He
          turns his attention to Zoe.
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D)

           Don't apologize to me, it's your body.
                         
          Patrick gestures towards Martha.

          the sun bed, lost in her book. Lucy does not answer.
                         
          Ted runs down the dock and dives into the water. Martha
          follows. Ted looks back to see Martha stand at the end of
          the dock, take off her clothes and dive in naked.
                         
          Martha swims, lost in her own world.
                         
          Lucy notices Martha, grabs a towel, and walks down to the
          end of the dock. Ted swims back and gets out.

          sneak one more glimpse of Martha.

           So you can't. We don't, just don't. I
           have a bathing suit you can borrow.
                         
          Martha gets out of the water. Lucy wraps the towel around
          her and walks away. Martha dries off. She feels
          embarrassed.

           It's cool, I'm good at hiding it.
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          People are scattered around a large room sleeping. Watts
          enters and bangs two pots together to wake everyone.

          Martha other girls get dressed in the communal closet.
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE DINING AREA- MORNING
                         
          Martha does dishes, Katie clears the table.
                         
                          KATIE
           We switch off jobs each day so we all
           know how to do different things.
                          (BEAT)
           Do you knit?

                          MARTHA
           No. I can learn though.
                         
                          KATIE
           It's okay, you'll find your role. It
           takes time for people to find their role
           in a new family.
                         
          Katie pours the cleaner on the floor, it sloshes around.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           We sell blankets in town. We still need
           some money, but when the farm's up and
           running we'll be self sufficient and
           we'll never have to worry about it again.
                         
                          MARTHA
           When do you think that'll happen?
                         
                          KATIE
           Hopefully by the end of the summer but
           we'll see. It's hard to get machinery and
           live stock without cash.
                         
                          MARTHA
           That'll be nice.
                         
          Katie accidentally drops a plate.
                         
                          KATIE
           Shoot.
                         
          Martha gets down and starts to clean it up.
                         
                         
          EXT. FARM - DAY
                         
          Martha, Watts, Max, Zoe and a few others sit around and
          listen to two men play guitar. Everyone is talking and
          laughing and having a nice time.
                         
          Patrick approaches. He observes everyone for a moment, he
          seems agitated. He speaks above everyone and above the
          music.
                         
                          PATRICK
           How's everything going so far Marcy May?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Good.
                         
          The guys stop playing music.

           You like it here?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah, it's really nice.
                         
                          PATRICK
           I want you to feel at home.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I do. Thanks.
                         
                          PATRICK
           People have abandoned you your whole
           life. I don't blame you for not trusting
           anyone.
                         
                          MARTHA
           What?
                         
                          PATRICK
           If you ever want to have a meaningful
           relationship, you need to let your guard
           down.
                         
          Martha is embarrassed and feels on the spot.
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D)
           It's not your fault, but it's there. If
           you feel safe here, and I think you do,
           let us in. We just want to help you.
                         
                          ZOE
           Yeah, we think you're fucking awesome.
                         
                          PATRICK
           If you're going to live here then really
           be apart of things.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING
                         
          Lucy is putting away groceries. Martha enters.
                         
                          LUCY
           Good morning. How are you feeling today?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Good.
                         
                          LUCY
           There's this great juice shop in town, I
           got us a couple of juices.

                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           This one is Kale with ginseng. It gives
           me energy, so I thought it might help
           you.
                         
           Martha takes a sip. It tastes terrible but she drinks it.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           I got pineapple orange too if that's
           better.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Maybe that's better. Sorry, thanks.
                         
                          LUCY
           I also got a box of these protein bars
           just in case you want to snack.
                         
          Martha watches Lucy put the groceries away.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Why is the house so big?
                         
                          LUCY
           It's not that big.
                         
                          MARTHA
           For two people, it's huge.
                         
                          LUCY
           We like to entertain. Our friends
           come up for weekends and sometimes
           we have parties. It's just good to
           have space.
                         
                          MARTHA
           So no one else lives here?
                         
                          LUCY
           Of course no one else lives here.

           It is hot, sunny, and peaceful. Martha sits cross legged.
           Ted reads the newspaper. Lucy sunbathes. Martha notices
           they wear wedding rings.
                         
                          MARTHA

                          LUCY
           Earlier this year, in the spring.
                         
          There is an awkward silence.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           I tried to get in touch with you,
           apparently you got rid of your cell
           phone?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I lost it.
                         
                          LUCY
           You never got a new one?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I got used to not having it.

           Martha?
                         
          Martha shakes her head. Ted walks to the back of the
          boat. Martha has to stand up to let him pass through the
          narrow walk way. He brushes up against her as he squeezes
          by.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Was it a big wedding?
                         
                          LUCY
           No, about forty people. Mostly his
           family.

                          MARTHA
           Did she smoke like chimney and complain
           about everything.

          Ted laughs.
                         
                          LUCY
           She's not that bad.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You never had to live with her.

          Lucy picks up her Polaroid camera and frames up Martha.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Well I'm sure she'd love to know you're

           I hate her.
                         
          Martha notices the camera and quickly turns away.
                         
                          LUCY
           Relax, I don't have any pictures of you.

           Jesus you're gorgeous. It's annoying.
                         
          Martha cracks a smile. Lucy snaps the shot.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)

           Don't shake it, that's a myth.
                         
          Martha looks deep in thought, she continues to shake the
          Polaroid.
                         
                          MARTHA

          Ted walks back to the front of the boat and looks at
          Martha's ass as he passes. Martha is embarrassed. She
          stares at the Polaroid.

          dress.

           try it.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Why does it matter?
                         
                          LUCY
           It just feels good to put on something
           nice and comfortable.
                         
          Martha slips on the dress and a funny pose.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           It looks good you little shit.

                          LUCY
           You're making fun of me and I think it
           looks really good.
                         
          They both laugh.

           Martha wears Lucy's dress. Ted, Lucy and Martha sit
           around the table eating dinner.
                         
           Ted picks at the food.

           It's not dry.
                         
          Martha laughs. Ted starts laughing. Lucy tries it again.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           It just needs a little salt. What are you
           laughing about I cooked for you your
           whole life.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You microwaved chicken nuggets and
           fish sticks.
                         
           Ted and Martha continue to laugh. Lucy gets up from the
           table. She comes back with salt and dumps it on the food.

          Martha lies awake in bed staring at the ceiling. She is
          lost deep in thought.

          MARTHA SLOWLY WAKES UP. SHE IS LYING ON HER STOMACH ON
          COLD CEMENT. THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF CANDLES ON THE FLOOR.
          SHE IS DISORIENTED AND FEELS SOMEONE ON TOP OF HER. SHE
          TURNS BACK TO LOOK BUT IT'S HARD TO MOVE. SHE CATCHES A
          GLIMPSE OF PATRICK, LEANING OVER HER DRIPPING SWEAT. 
          PATRICK IS AGGRESSIVELY HAVING SEX WITH HER FROM BEHIND.

          Martha seems like she has been drugged, she has a white
          robe draped around her. Katie consoles her and makes her
          drink water.
                         
                          KATIE
           I know you feel like something bad just
           happened Marcy May, but you have to trust
           me, that was not bad, it was truly good.
           We've all been in this situation, and we
           wouldn't all still be here if what
           happened in that room was bad. We all
           love each other very much, we are all
           together on this, you have to trust us.

          Zoe and Martha share a single mattress on the floor in a
          small dark room. Martha is still wrapped in the robe, she
          is still dazed.

                          ZOE
           Yeah, it's so special.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I can't remember anything, I just woke up
           on the floor and felt this pain -
                         
                          ZOE
           That's the cleansing. It's good. It means
           it's working if you can't remember
           things. You're cleansing yourself of the
           past and the toxins.
                         
           Martha is distant.
                         
                          ZOE (CONT'D)
           You need to share yourself, don't be so
           selfish.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm not.
                         
                          ZOE
           So smile then, enjoy this amazing night.
           It only happens once.
                         
           Zoe rests her forehead against Martha's forehead. They
           curl up together in a very intimate way.
                         
           Martha smiles. Zoe kisses her on the lips. Martha is
           caught off guard. She laughs. They have a second peck on
           the lips before closing their eyes to sleep.

          song. Everyone claps for him. Patrick, who sits in the back,
          stands up and walks up to the stage. Everyone gets excited.
                         
           He tunes his guitar.

          Martha sits in the back listening. Everyone turns around
          to look at her. She watches on as Patrick begins to play.
                         
          The song is a beautiful, intense and haunting folk song.
          The whole group is entranced. Martha is mesmerized by
          him.
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D)

           And you ask me, ask me about the
                          LIGHTNING
           And the lady, lady, lady she understands
           It's a dream for the future and the water

          Martha is on her hands and knees scrubbing the kitchen
          floor.
                         
          Ted gets a six pack out of the fridge. He cracks a beer
          and drinks it.

          over and motions for Martha to take the wheel. Ted slowly
          lets go and moves over so she can take the helm. They
          brush up against each other. Martha is driving the boat.
          She bounces up and down like an excited little girl.

           No. She's good. She's relieved to have
           you back. You had her worried.
                         
                          MARTHA

                          MARTHA
           I didn't think Lucy would worry about me.
                         
                          TED
           Well, she did.
                         
          There is another awkward silence. They both drink their
          beer.

          Martha takes off her clothes. She is wearing a bikini
          that Lucy gave her. It does not quite fit. The bathing
          suit sags and top of her ass shows. Ted tries not to 
          look.
                         
          THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER AS SHE DIVES UNDER WATER.

          Martha brings her head above water and she is with a
          group of people from the farm swimming in a swimming
          hole.

          Martha watches as Watts jumps off the cliff into the water.
          Everyone cheers him on. Patrick swims up behind Martha.
                         
                          PATRICK
           You jump yet?
                         
                          MARTHA
           No.
                         
                          PATRICK
           Go on.
                         
          Watts swims by and guides her out of the water.
                         
          Watts and Martha ascend up a narrow dirt path to the top of a
          rock face.
                         
                          WATTS

                          MARTHA
           I can't.
                         
                          WATTS
           Sure you can.
                         
          Watts jumps. Martha stands alone at the top of the cliff
          naked.
                         
          Everyone is looking up at her cheering her on. She builds up
          the courage and jumps.
                         
           She hits the water, everything goes dark. The frame fills
           with tiny bubbles, she comes up for air exhilarated. She
           continues to swim, the camera follows her under water.
           The darkness of the water makes the screen go black.
                         
                         
           INT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
           The hallway is dark, the space is unclear. Martha walks
           down a hallway and we learn it's the farm house. She
           walks into Patrick's room. She get's into bed with him
           and curls up in his arms and falls asleep. She looks safe
           and happy. He welcomes her, the room looks warm and
           comforting.

          wakes up. THUMP, ROLL. Martha sits up and listens. She
          waits in anticipation. THUMP.

          door to Ted and Lucy's room.
                         
          Ted and Lucy are having sex. Martha watches for a moment,
          then creeps into the room and quietly curls up on the
          edge of the bed.
                         
          Lucy does not see Martha. Ted does not say anything, he
          continues to have sex with Lucy. His motion becomes
          harder, Lucy opens her eyes and Ted jumps up.
                         
                          LUCY

           Nothing!
                         
          Ted turns on the light. He sits on the edge of the bed.
                         
                          LUCY
           Jesus, you can't just come in like that.

           God damn it, what's wrong?

           were on the other side.
                         
                          LUCY
           You can't come into our room when we're
           having sex, that's not normal! It's 
           private.

           understand why it's not okay.

                          MARTHA
           Because it's privte and it's not normal.
                         
          Lucy can see something is really wrong.
                         
                          LUCY
           Just lie down Martha.
                         
          Martha lies in Lucy's lap. Lucy is uncomfortable with the
          contact, she pushes Martha's head onto a pillow.

           38.
                         
                         
                         
                          MARTHA
           What do you mean?
                         
                          LUCY
           Did he ever, hit you?
                         
                          MARTHA
           No.
                         
                          LUCY
           You had a bruised ear, and when you
           called me you were hysterical.
                         
          Martha feels her ear.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Are you sure?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yes.
                         
                          LUCY
           You can tell me.
                         
                          MARTHA
           He never hit me.
                         
          Beat.
                         
                          LUCY
           I wish you felt more comfortable talking
           to me.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I do.
                         
                          LUCY
           So talk.
                         
                          MARTHA
           There's nothing to talk about. I had a
           boyfriend, he lied to me, I left. That's
           it, everything doesn't have to be a big
                          DEAL
                         
                         
          EXT. FARM GARDEN - DAY
                         
          Martha, Zoe and Katie work in the garden. Several men,
          are lifting heavy rocks to make a stone wall.
                         
          Max is in the hay loft. Zoe is tucked around the corner
          smoking a cigarette. Patrick catches her.
           39.
                         
                         
          He swats it out of her hand and scolds her. After a
          moment he puts his forehead to her forehead and caresses
          her head.
                         
                          KATIE
                          (TO MARTHA)
           Don't stare!
                         
          Zoe walks back to the garden.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You okay?
                         
                          ZOE
           Yeah. He's right. I don't know why I'm so
           weak.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You're not. You'll quit.
                         
          An OLD BROWN CAR pulls into the driveway. A YOUNG GIRL,
          no more than fifteen years old gets out.
                         
                          MARTHA (CONT'D)
           Who's that?
                         
                          KATIE
           Her name's Sarah I think.
                         
          TWO WOMEN welcome SARAH and walk her into the house.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
                          (TO MARTHA)
           You should handle her.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You think?
                         
                          KATIE
           You're ready. Zoe can help but you'll be
           great.
                         
                         
          INT. LUCY'S CAR - DAY
                         
          Martha sits in the passenger seat, Lucy drives. 
                         
          Martha notices a BROWN CAR is parked at the top of the 
          driveway on the side of the road. Martha is troubled by 
          the parked car's presence. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Whose car was that? 
           40.
                         
                         
                         
                          LUCY 
           I don't know. Why? 
                         
                          MARTHA
           Just curious.
                         
                          LUCY
           There's a hiking trail, people leave 
           their cars there all the time. 
                         
                         
          INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY
                         
          Lucy looks through produce. Martha takes the cart and
          runs down the isle with it. She picks her feet off the
          ground so she is riding on the cart. Lucy is amused.
                         
          Martha turns around and goes faster, flying all the way
          down the isle. A good looking YOUNG MAN walks into the
          isle. Martha almost hits him with the cart but she slams
          her feet on the floor and just misses him. Lucy runs up
          and takes the shopping cart back. Martha doesn't say
          anything, she just stares at him.
                         
                          LUCY
           Sorry.
                         
                          YOUNG MAN
           It's okay.
                         
          The young man walks down the isle. Martha watches him go.
                         
                          LUCY
           You're going to hurt someone.
                         
          Martha is distracted.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Can you go get me a large jug of water.
                         
                          MARTHA
           What's wrong with the tap?
                         
                          LUCY
           I like bottled.
                         
                          MARTHA
           It's a waste.
                         
                          LUCY
           Will you get it or not?

          Martha walks through the refrigerated section looking for
          water. She notices the Young Man walking behind her. She
          stops to get water.
                         
          He stops to buy beer. He looks at her. She grabs the
          water and walks away.

           You'll get used to it. Your body doesn't 
           need that much food. You're taught to 
           overconsume.

           44.
                         
                         
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Uh huh. 
                         
                          SARAH 
           They look just like him. 
                          (BEAT) 
           All the kids here are boys? 
                         
          Martha picks one up, she is very natural with him. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           He only has boys. 
                         
                          SARAH 
           You're good with them. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           You want to hold him? 
                         
                          SARAH 
           No Thanks. 
                          (BEAT) 
           I don't have to take care of them do I? 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Not if you don't want to. There are 
           plenty of jobs to be done. 
                          (BEAT) 
           You'll find your role. It takes time for 
           people to find their role in a new 
           family. 
                         
                         
          EXT. FARM HOUSE - DAY 
                         
          Martha walks with Sarah and Zoe across the courtyard and 
          out into the field towards the woods. 
                         
                          ZOE 
                          (TO MARTHA) 
           I called my dad today to ask for money. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Does Patrick know? 
                         
                          ZOE 
           He asked me to. Sometimes, if there's 
           something we really need I'll call. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           How was it? 
           45.
                         
                         
                         
                          ZOE 
           Fine, they're not bad people. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Did he give you the money? 
                         
                          ZOE 
           Yeah. He thinks I'm on drugs. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Do you tell him you're not? 
                         
                          ZOE 
           No, that's why he gives it to me. I guess 
           he'd rather pay for it than think I'm 
           sucking dick for it. 
                         
                          SARAH 
           I've done drugs. Not a lot but I've tried 
           everything pretty much, except heroin. 
                         
                          ZOE 
           It's good to try everything at least 
           once. You find out who you are that way. 
           What about drinking, do you drink? 
                         
                          SARAH 
           I have, but I don't. 
                         
                          ZOE 
           Good, we don't drink. It just makes you 
           angry and less focused. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Don't get the wrong idea Sarah. We don't 
           talk to our old families. 
                         
                          SARAH 
           I wouldn't call my Dad anyway, no matter 
           how much he paid me. 
                         
          Patrick and Watts walk out of the woods. 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           Hey. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Hi Patrick, Did you meet Sarah yet? 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           Sally, yeah.

          INT. FARM KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Katie teaches Martha how to make a vegetable drink.
          Martha adds some herbs.
                         
                          KATIE
           That's enough.
                         
          Katie hands her a large chalky white pill.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           Half is fine.
                         
          Martha breaks the tablet in half and drops it into the
          drink. She crushes it with a spoon.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Martha is back at the Lake house. Lucy enters and begins
          to load the dishwasher. Martha holds the glass with the
          green drink which we now see is just water.
                         
                          LUCY
           I'll do these if you want to go to bed.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't mind.
                         
                          LUCY
           Get some sleep.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Okay.
                         
          Martha leaves. Holding the glass tightly, Martha walks to
          her bedroom.
                         
          IN ONE LONG TAKE, WHILE WALKING FROM THE KITCHEN TO THE
          BEDROOM, THE GLASS OF WATER HAS CHANGED BACK TO THE GREEN
          DRINK MARTHA PREPARED WITH KATIE.
                         
                         
          INT. FARM/SMALL DARK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Martha enters her bedroom holding the green drink.
                         
          Sarah sits in a chair wearing a WHITE ROBE. The room is
          no longer Martha's bedroom at the lake, it is a small
          dark room at the farm.
           47.
                         
                         
                         
                          MARTHA
           Oh, hi.
                         
                          SARAH
           Hi.
                         
          Sarah is nervous. Martha brushes Sarah's hair.
                         
                          SARAH (CONT'D)
           What do I have to do?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Nothing you don't want to. Drink this, it
           will help you relax.
                         
          Sarah takes a sip of a thick green drink. She gags.
                         
                          MARTHA (CONT'D)
           It's herbal. It's the start of your
           cleansing.
                         
          Martha lifts the bottom of the glass to force it down.
                         
                          MARTHA (CONT'D)
           We've all done it so you know there's
           nothing to worry about.
                         
                          SARAH
           Do I have to wear this robe?
                         
                          MARTHA
                          (WHISPERING)
           I know it seems a bit silly, but it's a
           part of it.
                         
          Sarah looks very uncomfortable. She is getting light
          headed from the drink.
                         
                          MARTHA (CONT'D)
           You look amazing. It's your special night
           with him, enjoy it, you'll be great.
                         
                          SARAH
           Thanks.
                         
          Martha helps Sarah up and passes her through a door to
          the next room. She removes Sarah's robe and lays her on
          the ground. Martha shuts the door locking her in.
                         
          Martha lies down on the floor and curls up into a ball.
           48.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          INT. MARTHA'S BEDROOM - MORNING
                         
          Martha wakes up wearing Lucy's dress. She has wet
          herself.
                         
          Martha takes off the dress and stuffs it between the
          mattress and the box spring.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAKE - SUNSET
                         
          Martha sits alone on the steps looking out onto the
          water. She is deep in thought. Lucy walks down the stairs
          and sits next to her.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Shouldn't we start cooking?
                         
                          LUCY
           I just made some potato salad. Ted's
           cooking the fish.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I thought we were going to cook.
                         
                          LUCY
           We cooked last night.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Oh, yeah.
                         
          Martha is lost deep in thought.
                         
                          MARTHA (CONT'D)
           Do you ever have this thing where you
           can't tell if something's a memory or if
           it's something you've dreamed?
                         
                          LUCY
           Not really.
                         
          Beat.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Do you blame me for anything?
                         
                          MARTHA
           No.
                          (BEAT)
           Like what?
           49.
                         
                         
                         
                          LUCY
          I don't know.
                          (BEAT)
          I'm just trying to figure out why we
          stopped talking.
                         
                          MARTHA
          I didn't think about it.
                         
                          LUCY
          Really?
                         
                          MARTHA
          We were far apart.
                         
                          LUCY
          Sometimes I wonder if, maybe I could have
          taken better care of you.
                         
                          MARTHA
                          (MUMBLES)
          The past doesn't matter.
                         
                          LUCY
          It does matter.
                         
                          MARTHA
          I took care of myself.
                         
                          LUCY
          I know you did. I think I could have done
          more though.
                         
                          MARTHA
          Stop it.
                         
                          LUCY
          Be honest with me, you never think about
          it?
                         
                          MARTHA
          No.
                         
                          LUCY
          You're not angry at me?
                         
                          MARTHA
          I know you don't think much of me but I
          knew what I was doing then and I still
          do.
           50.
                         
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           No, Martha, I think the world of you, I'm 
           just wondering if I should have come back 
           and kept you in school and helped you go 
           to college, you had so much potential.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't need your guidance, I never did. 
           I'm a teacher and a leader, you just
           never let me be that but now I know I am,
           I know who I am.
                         
                          LUCY
           Teacher and a leader? What are you
           talking about? I always encouraged you to 
           do more, but you shut me out.
                         
          Martha doesn't respond she drifts off into deep thought.

           I don't know. People don't need careers,
           people should just exist.
                         
          Ted laughs. 
                         
                          LUCY
           He's just saying we should start talking
           about what you're interested in. Maybe we
           can help you get some ideas together.

           I have moments when I would love to move

           work that way.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You can do that if you want to.

                          (CAUTIOUSLY)
           It's not your fault but you learned that
           success is measured by money and
           possessions. It's just not the right way
           to live.

          Lucy is floored by Martha's response.
                         
                          TED
           And what do you think the right way to
           live is? Being a hysterical mess and
           causing your family pain. You're eating
           my food and sleeping under my roof so
           watch your mouth. You're rude.
                         
          Martha, with a frightening streak of viciousness stands
          up to Ted.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You don't know anything about it.

          Martha hangs up. The phone rings. She unplugs the phone
          and collapses on the floor.

          Martha and the others are practicing pick pocketing.
          Martha looks out into the feild to see Patrick talking
          with Sarah. She is enamoured by him.
                         
                         
          EXT. FARM FIELD - DAY 
                         
          Zoe, Martha, Sarah and MAX are shooting bottles in the 
          woods. 
                         
                          MAX 
           Watts said I'm supposed to teach you how 
           to defend yourselves but I think you're 
           hopeless. 
                         
                          ZOE 
           I'm surprised your dumb ass even knows 
           how to load it. 
                         
                          MAX 
           Please, I'm like Doc fuckin' Holiday. 
                         
          Zoe shoots and hits a bottle. He comes up behind Zoe, 
          wraps his arms around her, kisses her neck and gropes her 
          breasts. She moves his hands away. Sarah watches on. 
                         
                          MAX (CONT'D) 
           God, you are so hot when you shoot, makes 
           my willy hard. 
                         
          Max takes the gun out of her hand and fires several 
          shots. He misses the bottles. 
                         
                          ZOE 
           What happened Doc? I should be teaching 
           you. 
                         
          He loads another round, aims, shoots, and hits a bottle. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Alright, my turn. 
                         
          Max wraps his hands around hers so she is firmly gripping 
          the gun. 
           54.
                         
                         
                         
                          ZOE 
                          (PLAYFUL) 
           Alright Max, was this just an excuse to 
           grope Marcy. 
                         
                          MAX 
           I'm teaching her how to shoot. 
           Then you just squeeeeeeeeeze. 
                         
          Patrick is walking towards them carrying a sac. Martha 
          fires a few shots and misses. 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           Focus. Take a deep breath. Think about 
           someone who wronged you. Feel it, feel 
           how they made you feel in your stomach. 
           Take a deep breath, feel it all moving 
           out into your hands. Let it build. It's 
           transferring to the gun, building in the 
           gun. Now release. 
                         
          She fires five powerful shots quickly, one shatters. A 
          smile grows on martha's face. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
                          (SMILING) 
           Feels good right? 
                         
          Martha nods. Patrick opens a sac and lets 2 cats out. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
           Now try that. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           What do you mean? 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           Shoot it. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           They're living animals. 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           So, shoot Max then. 
                         
          Patrick lifts Martha's hand so the gun is pointing at 
          Max. Max is frozen, he smiles awkwardly. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
           Go on! 
                         
          Max is confused, he gets embarrassed. 
           55.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX 
           Fuck this. 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           Don't walk away from me Max. 
                         
          Max stops. Martha drops the gun down to her waist. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
           The cat has terminal cancer, it's in 
           excruciating pain. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           I can't. 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           Max has no substance, he's just here to 
           free load and be around the girls but 
           you're a teacher and leader, you just 
           don't see it because no one let you 
           believe it before me. You're a leader a 
           Marcy, now prove it. 
                         
          Martha is shook up. She does not fire the gun. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
           The cat reminds you of some fluffy thing 
           you think you used to love. You're 
           holding on to some false emotion that 
           stops you from doing what's right. 
                         
          Zoe takes the gun out of Martha's hand. The gun goes off. 
          Martha and Max jump. Zoe shot the cat without blinking. 
          She hands the gun back to Martha. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
           I could spend my life being selfish, 
           living alone, using this gift for me but 
           I've sacrificed myself to be what you all 
           need me to be. You need to trust me. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           I trust you. 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           Then you shouldn't need me to explain 
           everything. 
                         
          A gun shot goes off. They all look up. Max looks 
          mortified, he has shot the other cat. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
           What did you do? 
           56.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAX 
           You said it was sick. 
                         
                          PATRICK 
           One of them was sick, Zoe knew which one 
           it was!

           You okay?

                          MARTHA 
           Where are you going to go? 
                         
                          MAX 
           I got places. My cousin lives in 
           Bennington, he said I could go up there 
           and make like, $500 a week selling weed. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           You don't want to do that. 
                         
                          MAX 
           I don't care what I do. I'm sick of all 
           these rules. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           Max, they're not rules. It's just common 
           sense. 
                         
                          MAX 
           It feels like rules. They won't let me do 
           anything. I can't even go on the house 
           runs. I'd be great at taking shit. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           It's not about taking shit. 
                         
                          MAX 
           Sounds like it's about taking shit to me.

           And that's why you don't get to come. 
           You just don't get it.

           I'm not drinking. 
                         
          Martha takes the bottle out from under a hay bale. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           You're still living with all the shit you 
           carried out there. You're the only one, 
           let it go. 
                         
                          MAX 
           I'll try. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           No. You can't try. You have to stop. They 
           love you, they just want you to be 
           stronger. 
                         
                          MAX 
           I'm strong, they'll see. 
                         
          Max leans up and tries to kiss her. Martha stops him. She 
          hugs him instead. 
                         
                          MARTHA 
           You'll be okay. 
                         
                         
          EXT. LARGE EXPENSIVE COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          A rock is hurled onto the roof of the house. THUMP. It
          rolls down and off into the yard. Flood lights shine up
          at a beautiful large country home.
                         
          THREE PEOPLE run through the yard, dashing through the
          light and back into the shadows.
                         
          It is Martha, Watts, and Zoe, hurls another rock onto the
          roof.
                         
          A man inside comes to the window.
                         
          Zoe picks up a rock and throws it onto the roof. The man
          in the window walks towards his front door. Watts leads
          Martha towards the house.

          The man in the house comes out of his front door, walks
          around the side of his house and looks up to see what's
          hitting the roof. He leaves the front door open. Watts
          and Martha creep into the house.
                         
                         
          INT. EXPENSIVE COUNTRY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Martha and Watts walk through the house. They sneak past
          a living room where a woman watches television.

          There are two place settings at the dinning room table
          and two candles burning in vintage, steel candle holders.
                         
          Watts blows out the candles, pours wax on the table and
          lays the candles down. He steals the candle holders.
                         
          There is a large painting on the wall. He motions for
          Martha to help him. They get on either side and dismount
          the painting, then lay it face up on the floor.
                         
          They hear the man come inside and talk to his wife. 
                         
          They continue to creep through the house, into the
          kitchen and out the back door.

          each in the same room.
                         
          Patrick walks down stairs and sits quietly in the corner
          watching them.

          Martha lies awake in her room. She hears a car outside. 
          She creeps to her window and peeks out. She can't see 
          what kind of car it is. It leaves the lights and engine 
          on for a moment, then it shuts off. No one gets out. She 
          is frozen with fear. She builds up courage then leaves
          her room.
           59.

          Martha walks through the dark lake house, looking out the
          windows trying to see if anyone is coming, almost as if
          she is standing guard. She is trembling with fear.
                         
          A dark figure crosses from one room to another behind
          her. She freezes, turns and holds her breath.
                         
          The man walks out of the room. Martha screams. It's Ted.
                         
                          TED

          Ted sits on one end of the couch, Martha on the other
          end. He wears his robe and drinks a beer. He glances over
          at Martha who is lost in the movie, laughing.

          Martha lies down. He offers her a pillow. She raises her
          head and he puts it under.

          on the couch next to Ted. The TV is on and there are
          three empty beer bottle on the table.
                         
          Lucy is furious. She picks up the bottles and walks into
          the kitchen, being sure to make as much noise as she can.
                         
          Ted and Martha wake up. Martha sits up on the couch and
          watches Ted walk into the kitchen.

          EXT. LAKE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Martha walks towards the car, her anger is building. As
          she gets to the top of the road she picks up a rock and
          throws it through the car window. Glass shatters
          everywhere.
                         
          She picks up a loose shard of glass and scrapes a line on
          the side of the car. She drops the glass and stares at
          the mess for a moment before looking around to make sure
          no one has seen her.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Martha looks out the window at the brown car with the
          smashed window. It is raining.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Martha lies in bed. Something thumps on the roof. Martha
          flinches. THUMP. THUMP. THUMP. She flintches with each
          thump.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Martha helps Lucy clean the house.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You shouldn't smoke.
                         
                          LUCY
           What? I don't smoke.
           63.
                         
                         
                         
                          MARTHA
           Especially if you're trying to have a
           kid.
                         
                          LUCY
           Maybe you should mind your own business.
                         
          The phone rings. It startles Martha.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           I can't deal with talking to anyone right
           now.
                         
          Martha is frozen, watching the phone ring.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE/TED AND LUCY'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Lucy fixes Martha's hair and puts make up on her. Martha
          sits passively like a doll.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Martha walks down the stairs, she looks beautiful. She is
          wearing a long white dress, Lucy has done her hair and
          make up. She is cautious as she descends.
                         
          Guests have arrived. They are drinking cocktails and
          talking in the house and on the back porch. Jazz plays
          over speakers.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAKE HOUSE BACK PORCH - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Martha walks outside. Lucy introduces her to some of her
          friends. Martha looks like a zombie though, frozen at the
          sight of so many strangers.
                         
          Martha continues to walk around the edge of the party
          quietly observing everyone.
                         
          Something catches her eye.
                         
          She is studying the BARTENDER. She composes herself then
          approaches him cautiously.
                         
                          MARTHA
           What's you name?
                         
                          BARTENDER
           I'm sorry?
           64.
                         
                         
                         
                          MARTHA
           What's your name?
                         
                          BARTENDER
           Mike.
                         
          He puts out his hand to shake hers. She takes a half step
          back and studies his face.
                         
                          BARTENDER (CONT'D)
           Can I get you something?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I used to like this.
                         
          She points at the tequila.
                         
                          BARTENDER
           Straight?
                         
          She stands there looking dazed. She doesn't respond. He
          just pours it. He is confused by her.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I thought you weren't supposed to drink
           Mike.
                         
                          BARTENDER
           I'm not drinking.
                         
          He hands her the tequila. She suddenly slaps it out of
          his hand. The glass shatters on the ground.
                         
                          MARTHA
           You think you're so fucking smart.
                         
          Martha storms inside. Lucy follows her in.
                         
                          LUCY
           Hey, what happenind?
                         
                          MARTHA
           We all need to leave.
                         
                          LUCY
           What?
                         
                          MARTHA
           He's a fucking liar. We all need to
           leave.
                         
          She points to the bartender.
           65.
                         
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           What are you talking about?
                         
          Lucy lowers Martha's pointing hand and tries to move her
          away.
                         
                          MARTHA
           We have to leave. We all have to leave. I
           know him.
                         
                          LUCY
           Who?
                         
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           What the fuck is wrong with you?
                         
                          MARTHA
           You don't want to live with this Lucy.
                         
                          LUCY
           Martha.
                         
                          TED
           Calm down.
                         
          Ted approaches and helps guide Martha into their bedroom.
                         
          Lucy turns around to check the party. People are starting
          to notice. Lucy and Ted force Martha back into their
          bedroom. He closes the door.

           What are you talking about?
                         
                          MARTHA
           They're here.
                         
          Martha is frantic, she begins to hyperventilate.
                         
          Lucy tries to hug her, Martha squirms free. Lucy hugs her
          again and pulls her onto the bed, trying to get her to
          calm.
                         
                          LUCY
           Breath.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Don't touch me, you're not listening to
           me!
           66.
                         
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           Martha please try to breath. I don't know
           what you're talking about.
                         
          Ted walks into the bathroom and gets pills. He forces
          them down and makes Martha drink water.
                         
          She calms down. She falls back onto the bed.
                         
          Ted and Lucy look exhausted.

          INT. LARGE EXPENSIVE COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Martha walks through a large house in the dark. She gets
          to the front door and opens it letting in Katie, Zoe,
          Watts and Patrick. They immediately scatter around the
          house, looking in cupboards. Suddenly the lights turn on.
                         
                          MAN
           What the fuck.
                         
                          WATTS
           Hey, we can go.
                         
          The man is confused.
                         
                          MAN
           What do you want?
                         
                          WATTS
           Nothing.
                         
          The man goes to pick up the phone to call the police.
          Watts stops, turns and get's in his face.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)
           No need for that, we are leaving.
                         
          Watts, Zoe and Martha walk to the front door.
                         
          Patrick appears behind the man.
                         
                          PATRICK
           Calm down, if you calm down no one will
           get hurt.
                         
                          MAN
           What do you want?
           67.
                         
                         
                         
                          PATRICK
           We're not stealing, we don't want
           anything.
                         
                          MAN
           Just get out.
                         
                          PATRICK
           We're just looking at the house. It's
           nice.
                          (BEAT)
           We didn't realize you were home. We
           wouldn't have come in otherwise.
                         
                          MAN
           Just Leave.
                         
                          PATRICK
           I would but I can't be sure you won't
           call the police.
                         
                          MAN
           I won't. You didn't take anything so just
           go, I just want my family to be safe.
                         
                          PATRICK
           Safe? Why wouldn't anyone be safe. Unless
           you call the police, everything will be
           fine.
                         
                          MAN
           Okay, I won't. You have my word, please
           just go.
                         
          Martha walk outside. Patrick just stands there, he won't
          leave. Katie and Zoe walk out of the other room and are
          standing behind the Man. They don't move. He feels
          surrounded.
                         
                          MAN (CONT'D)
           Get the fuck out of my house.
                         
          Martha looks back but the view is blocked by the door. No
          one knows what to do. The girls are looking to Patrick
          but he's not doing anything. Suddenly Katie lunges at the
          man and stabs him in the neck. Blood spurts out and she
          stabs him again in the ribs.
                         
          They all run out.
           68.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          INT. FARM BEDROOM/HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Martha is in a small wood paneled room lying on a
          mattress. She is stunned.
                         
          She looks through the open door to see Katie and Watts
          washing in the bathroom.
                         
          Patrick enters the bedroom and sits on her bed with
          Martha. Martha closes her eyes pretending to sleep.
                         
                          PATRICK
           Look at me.
                         
          Patrick runs his hands through her hair.
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D)
           You okay?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Uh huh.
                         
          There is a long silence. Martha is clearly not okay.
                         
                          PATRICK
           You know that death is the most beautiful
           part of life, right? Death is beautiful
           because everyone fears death. And fear is
           the greatest human emotion of all because
           it creates complete awareness. When
           you're scared it forces you to be
           completely aware of your surroundings and
           the moment you're in. It brings you to
           NOW and that makes you truly present. And
           when you are truly present, that's
           nirvana, that's pure love. So, death is
           pure love.

          Martha wakes up. Lucy is sitting on the bed. She has
          brought Tea. Martha sits up and takes a sip.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's too hot, let it cool for a minute.
                         
          She smiles, lies down and curls up again. She is half
          asleep.
           69.

           Thanks mom. I'm sorry I ruined the party.
                         
                          LUCY
           Everything was fine.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Is it over?
                         
                          LUCY
           Yes, you slept through the night.
                         
                          MARTHA
           That's good.
                         
                          LUCY
           Are you going to drink the tea?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't want it.
                         
          Lucy gets up and leaves.

          EXT. FARM - DAY
                         
          Men are moving vehicles into the garage. Women are
          bringing the clothes inside off the clothes line. Martha
          is helping with the garden. There is a sense of urgency 
          to close the farm.
                         
          Max is in the hayloft trying to close the loft door. He 
          slips and falls 30 feet to the ground. Martha rushes over 
          to him. He is in pain. Watts comes out of the barn. 
                         
                          MARTHA
           We have to do something.
                         
                          WATTS
           He's fine. Right Max? 
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, I'm cool.
                         
          They help him up and he falls. He cant put pressure on
          his leg and he seems to have a concussion. 
                         
                          MARTHA

           There's nothing to do Marcy, you need to
           get inside. Max is strong, he'll be fine.
           Right?
                         
                          MAX
           Yeah, I'm good Marcy. Stop.

          talking.

          Everyone is sleeping. Max is curled up in the corner.
          Martha walks over to him and wakes him. There is vomit in 
          the corner. 
                         
                          MARTHA
           Do you feel alright? If you hit your head 
           you shouldn't sleep. 
                         
                          MAX
           I'm fine.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Do you know why we're down here? 
                         
                          MAX
           No. Do you?
                         
          She shakes her head.
                         
                          MARTHA
           What do you think it was?

           No. It's cool now, I don't really have 
           anywhere to go. Why, would you?

          Katie rings the dinner bell. Martha walks out of the
          house holding a large pot of soup. She walks it through
          the courtyard into the shed where everyone gathers to eat
          dinner.
                         
          Everyone from the farm stops work and walks towards the
          shed. It looks like more people are there than before,
          there are several new faces in the crowd.

          Martha is cleaning the house. The phone rings, she picks
          it up. A young girl's voice is on the other end.
                         
                          MARTHA

           Who's this?
                         
          There is something written on the wall Martha reads. 
          Martha signals to a girl in the kitchen to go outside. 
                         
                          VOICE

           Jane.

          Martha writes JANE HELLER on a list of names on the wall.
          Some of them have been scratched out. 
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't know, do you?
                         
          Watts comes inside.
                         
                          MARTHA (CONT'D)
           It's a Jane.

           that was my cousin Marlene, yeah, I'll
           see you in a bit then. Great, I'm glad
           you called.
                         
          Watts hangs up. He and Martha have a quiet exchange and
          Watts walks away.
                         
                          WATTS (CONT'D)

          Martha sneaks a bite of bread. Katie whacks her in the
          ear with a wooden spoon. A slight ringing remains
          throughout the scene.
                         
                          KATIE

           Why don't you go sit down, I'll finish
           up.
                         
          Lucy hands water and some pills to Martha. Martha takes
          the pills, walks into the other room and collapses on the
          couch in front of the television.
                         
          Ted walks into the kitchen. Martha listens from the

           I don't think she should stay with us

           when she's like this.
                         
          Lucy goes back to chopping.

           I can't stop feeling terrible for that
           poor man.
                         
                          ZOE
           I know. It happens though, we're never
           really dead or alive, we just exist, so
           he's still existing, but it's in a
           parallel time. Just don't think about it,
           it's in the past.
                         
          Martha is upset with how cold Zoe is.
                         
                         
          INT. FARM HOUSE BATHRROM - LATER 
                         
          Martha sits in the bathroom, knees pulled up to her chest 
          as she rests on the edge of the bathtub. 
           75.
                         
                         
          Someone knocks at the door. She pretends not to be in 
          there. There is another gentle know.
                         
                          ZOE 
           Martha, it's me, can I come in? 
                         
          Martha unlocks the door for Zoe. Patrick bursts in, slams 
          the door and corners Martha and yells at her. 
                         
                          PATRICK
           Haven't you learned anything?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I have.
                         
                          PATRICK
           I felt like we had a connection.
                         
                          MARTHA
                          (DESPERATE)
           We do!
                         
                          PATRICK
           That's not what you're showing me.
                         
          Patrick calms down. He sits. 
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D) 
           Maybe I asked too much from you too soon.
           You have potential but you're just not
           there yet. I'll expect less of you fro
           now on.
                         
          Martha is upset, like a trained animal, she runs back to
          his side, sits next to him and rests her head on his
          shoulder.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm sorry.
                         
          He runs his hand through her hair.
                         
                          PATRICK
           Shhh. It's okay.
                         
          He puts his hand on the inside of her thigh.
                         
                          PATRICK (CONT'D)
           You're my favorite, I won't lose you.
                         
                          CUT TO:
           76.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Martha wakes up on the couch confused, she sees a man
          standing over her. She quickly pushes him up, jumps over
          tyhe back of the couch and runs away.
                         
          The man is Ted. He follows her, trying to calm her down
          but she is in a blind state of panic.
                         
          She runs to the stairs. He follows her. She trips. He
          goes to see if she is okay. She kicks him. He falls down
          the stairs.
                         
          The lights turn on. Lucy comes out of the bedroom to see
          Ted at the bottom of the stairs. She rushes over to him.
                         
          Ted gets up slowly.
                         
                          LUCY
           Are you alright?
                         
          Ted pushes Lucy off of him.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           What the fuck happened?
                         
                          TED
           She kicked me down the stairs. Jesus
           Christ, what's it going to take, Lucy.
                         
          Martha starts crying, she becomes hysterical. Lucy is
          irate, she runs up the stairs and confronts Martha.
                         
                          LUCY
           You could have killed him.
                         
          Martha backs away.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I was confused.
                         
                          LUCY
           About what, what are you so confused
           about?
                         
                          MARTHA
           I thought he was someone else.
                         
          Lucy's anger is building.
           77.
                         
                         
                         
                          LUCY
           You thought he was someone else? What is
           wrong with you?
                          (BEAT)
           I'm not doing this anymore, I'm not doing
           this anymore. I beat myself up over you
           for years and I'm sick of it, I'm sick of
           chasing you down and worrying about you.
           I need to move on.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I'm sorry.
                         
                          LUCY
           You need help Martha.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I know.
                         
                          LUCY
           What happened to you?
                         
          Martha shakes her head with a severe look of fear in her
          eyes.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           What happened to you?
                         
                          MARTHA
                          (SCREAMING)
           I don't know.
                         
          Lucy doesn't know what else to do, she can see Martha is
          too far gone.
                         
                          LUCY
           We're going to get you proper help.
                         
          There is a long moment of silence.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Are you going to send me away?
                         
                          LUCY
           I don't know how to help you anymore.
                         
                          MARTHA
                          (PLEADING)
           Please don't. Please don't.
                         
                          LUCY
           I can't help you.
           78.
                         
                         
                         
                          MARTHA
           Please, I can't be alone, please.
                         
                          LUCY
           We're trying to start a family and I
           don't trust you to be here.
                         
          Lucy walks away.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Lucy?
                         
                          LUCY
           What?
                         
          Lucy stops at the bottom of the stairs.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           What?
                         
                          MARTHA
           You're going to be a terrible mother.
                         
          Lucy freezes, she tries to stay calm but bursts into
          tears. There is a long, tense silence. Lucy dries her
          eyes.
                         
                          LUCY
           Do you have any money left?
                         
          Martha shakes her head.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           Of course you don't.
                          (BEAT)
           We'll make sure everything is taken care
           of.
                         
          Lucy walks away, Martha is frozen on the stairs.
                         
                         
          INT. LAKE HOUSE - NEXT DAY
                         
          Martha walks through the house. All of the luggage is
          packed and sitting by the front door.
                         
          Ted sits on the couch eating a sandwich and drinking a
          beer.
           79.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          EXT. LAKE HOUSE BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
                         
          It is an overcast, unusually cold Labor Day. Lucy works
          in the garden.
                         
                          LUCY
           Going swimming?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           It's a bit chilly.
                         
                          MARTHA
           I don't mind.
                         
                          LUCY
           I think we both said some things last
           night that we didn't mean.
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           We scheduled an appointment for you
           tomorrow morning.
                         
          Martha looks into the back of the flower bed and notices
          footprints.
                         
                          MARTHA
           What's it like there?
                         
                          LUCY
           It looks nice.
                         
          Martha turns and walks down to the water.
                         
                          LUCY (CONT'D)
           We're heading back to the city in about
           an hour. You'll be ready to go?
                         
                          MARTHA
           Yep.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAKE HOUSE DOCK - DAY
                         
          Martha stands on the dock. She strips down to her
          underwear and dives in.
           80.
                         
                         
                         
          Martha swims out into the lake. She drops under the water
          and out of sight, a burst of bubbles pop up to the
          surface. A few seconds pass by and she is not coming up.
                         
          Suddenly she breaks back through the water and gasps for
          air.
                         
          She looks around at the thick woods and a handful of nice
          homes that appear to be empty now. No one else is
          swimming.
                         
          Martha sees a scruffy MAN sitting on a neighboring dock,
          he seems familiar. He is in his mid twenties, his jeans
          are rolled up and his feet dangle in the water. His shirt
          is slung over his shoulder and he smokes a cigarette. He
          looks directly at Martha. They make eye contact.
                         
          He finishes his smoke, throws the cigarette in the water,
          puts on his shirt and just sits there.
                         
          Martha swims back to the house.
                         
                         
          INT. TED'S CAR - DAY
                         
          Martha sits in the back seat of Ted and Lucy's car. Ted
          drives and Lucy sits up front. They drive up the driveway
          and turn out onto the road. Ted and Lucy talk. Martha 
          gets a concerned look on her face. Ted slams on the 
          breaks. 
                         
                          TED 
           Jesus Christ. 
                         
                          LUCY
           Are you okay?
                         
                          TED
           Yeah.
                         
                          LUCY
           Fucking idiot. What was he doing?
                         
          The MAN from the dock walks past the car. They almost hit
          him. As they drive away, Martha turns to see him get into
          the a brown car, start the engine and drive. The car
          drives behind Ted's car.
