          The universe is deathless;
          Is deathless because, having no finite self,
          it stays infinite.
          A sound man by not advancing himself stays the further ahead
          of himself,
          By not confining himself to himself,
          sustains himself outside himself.

                         FADE IN
                         
                         
          INT. DARKENED BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          A spherical black monolith rises up from a white surface...
          white like the moon.
                         
          In the darkness, the towers metal skin is barely visible.
                         
          We ROTATE AROUND, revealing the tower to actually be a LAMP --
          not rising up from a surface, but hanging down from a white
          ceiling. The bulb unlit.
                         
          Directly below the lamp is the very definition of innocence -
          a sleeping child. Chest rising and falling with each breath.
                         
          We HOVER over the young boy...watching him. A blanket
          emblazoned with dinosaurs is draped across his limbs. His
          mouth is slack, eyelids twitching to dreams unseen.
                         
          The truly deep sleep that an adult can only wish for.
                         
          We move away from him, exploring the dark room. Strewn with
          toys. The door is slightly ajar. We float through it into--
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --a long hallway. Even darker than the bedroom. And without
          the boys rhythmic breathing, even quieter.
                         
          A window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach.
                         
          Someone is standing in front of it.
                         
          The murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away. We
          follow it, tentative. Turning a corner, we see the figure.
          Standing in a doorway.
                         
          Now we can make out the edges of the person. It is an old
          woman. Hair in a Victorian bun. A corseted dress.
                         
          She stares at us.
                         
                          WOMAN
           Let me in.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          OPENING TITLES play out to the shrill screams of George
          Crumb's `Black Angels I: Night Of The Electric Insects'.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Eyes flick open.
                         
          A woman blinks awake, gazing around the room. Another
          bedroom. Sparse. Just a bed and a cabinet. It is 5.43 AM.
                         
          Her eyes settle on the man lying next to her in the dark. His
          heaving snores have woken her up.
                         
          She is RENAI (pronounced Renee) LAMBERT (36). With a quiet
          determination she is holding on to her youthful good looks,
          but the lines of age are creeping in.
                         
          She has settled into the `comfort' years of a marriage: hair
          pinned up messily, wearing dowdy pajamas.
                         
          She beholds her husband, taking him in. Considering him. He
          snorts and smacks his lips. Very unflattering.
                         
          She climbs out of bed.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          High ceilings. Exposed beams. Spanish style windows.
                         
          Renai treads across wooden floorboards into a sunken living
          room. No matter careful she is, there is a loud creak with
          each step. A GRANDFATHER CLOCK in the corner ticks steadily.
                         
          There is barely any furniture in here, only a BOOKCASE and a
          PIANO. What there is a lot of...is boxes. Large moving boxes.
                         
          Renai plops cross-legged onto the floor and rips open one of
          the boxes, marked BOOKS. She plucks out a handful of books
          and lines them up on the bookshelf. Then another handful.
                         
          They are all self-help and self-improvement books. Titles
          like `Be The Better You' and `Inch By Inch, It's A Cinch: A
          Guide To Achieving Your Goals' pop out.
                         
          She spots a sealed box labelled PHOTO ALBUMS. She strips away
          the tape and wrestles out a dusty album of wedding photos.
                         
          Smiling faces greet her as she thumbs through the pages. The
          happy couple. Young. Glowing. Sadness washes over her.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           Mom?
                         
          She snaps out of it and turns to see DALTON LAMBERT (8). Her
          son. He approaches her, rubbing his eyes. (It is not the boy
          we saw in the opening scene.)
           4.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           What are you doing up, kiddo?
                         
                          DALTON
           I don't like my room.
                         
                          RENAI
           You'll get used to it. It's only
           your first night.
                         
          He climbs into her lap. She bites on his ear playfully.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Argh, I'm going to eat you.
                         
                          DALTON
           What are you looking at?
                         
                          RENAI
           Just some photos.
                         
                          DALTON
           What photos?
                         
          She hefts another album from the box, prying it open. A photo
          of a grinning young girl greets them, hair in pigtails.
                         
                          RENAI
           Do you know who that is?
                         
                          DALTON
           No.
                         
                          RENAI
           That's me.
                         
                          DALTON
           It doesn't look like you.
                         
                          RENAI
           I know. I'm so happy there. But
           it's me. When I was your age. I was
           a kid once too, you know.
                         
                          DALTON
           No, you weren't.
                         
          Renai bursts out laughing. She is famous for her big laugh.
                         
                          RENAI
           Thanks. Maybe you're right...I don't
           remember being this person at all.
           I hope she smiled like that all the
           time, whoever she was.
           5.
                         
                         
          She sizes up her son. The living embodiment of the photo.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           This is a terrible thing to admit,
           Dalton, but sometimes I get jealous of
           you. That you're so young. That you
           haven't made any of your decisions yet.
                         
                          DALTON
           I don't wanna grow old.
                         
                          RENAI
           Well, it starts happening to us
           from the moment we're born.
                         
          She points to the hands on the grandfather clock.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Every time that clock ticks, we all
           get a little bit older.
                         
          She turns the page in the photo album, seeing an old man.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           That's your grandpa. You wouldn't
           remember him.
                         
                          DALTON
           He smells like smoke.
                         
                          RENAI
           Yeah...good memory. He did smoke
           that god awful pipe, didn't he?
                         
                          DALTON
           Show me a picture of dad when he
           was a little kid.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't even know if we have any.
           He's hopeless with keeping photos.
                         
                          DALTON
           Show me a picture of me when I was
           a little kid.
                         
                          RENAI
           Your pictures are all in the computer.
           Nobody keeps photo albums like this
           anymore, they're ancient relics. They
           should. I like being able to touch
           something, instead of it floating
           around in cyber world. If the laptop
           breaks, your whole existence is erased.
           6.
                         
                         
                          DALTON
           What was I like when I was a little kid?
                         
                          RENAI
           You are a little kid.
                         
          She kisses him on the forehead and stares into his eyes.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           If only you knew what I know.
                         
          We hear a baby crying off screen.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           You certainly didn't cry as much as
           your little sister does. Come on.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, LAMBERT HOME - MORNING
                         
          Chaos.
                         
          Boxes of dinnerware have not been unpacked yet and it is
          turning the usual morning routine into a nightmare.
                         
          Renai is on the phone as her kids buzz around a kitchen island
          at top speed, creating a high-energy, manic pace in the room.
                         
                          RENAI

          Her son FOSTER (6), tugs on her leg, holding a box of cereal.
                         
                          FOSTER
           I need a bowl, mom.
                         
          Renai rips open a box, rifling through newspaper, phone
          wedged against her shoulder. She holds out a cup, flustered.

           It's too small.
                         
                          RENAI

          Foster slumps on the floor, pouring cereal and overflowing milk
          into the cup. A baby girl in a high chair, CALI (2), squeals.
           7.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, LAMBERT HOME - MORNING
                         
          JOSH LAMBERT (37) gapes into the mirror, face covered in
          soap.
                         
          He washes it off. Now he's awake we see that he is a handsome,
          clean-cut guy - a former high school nerd who got revenge by
          growing into his body.
                         
          He sorts through a box labelled JOSH'S BATHROOM STUFF.
                         
          He takes out two bottles - TONER and MOISTURIZER. He dabs the
          toner on, then smooths the moisturizer into his forehead and
          around his eyes.
                         
          He suddenly notices a grey hair. Looks mortified.
                         
                          JOSH
           (Michael Corleone voice)
           Every time I think I've pulled you
           out...you grow back in.
                         
          He plucks it out, wincing melodramatically.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Ouch!
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, LAMBERT HOME - MORNING
                         
          Josh strides in, tie hanging open around his neck. Renai is
          still on the phone. Josh points to his tie.
                         
                          RENAI
           Well, I'd like to keep the old
           number if I could.
                          (TO JOSH)
           You really need to learn how to do
           this, honey.
                         
          She threads the tie into a knot for him.
                         
                          JOSH
                          (TO FOSTER)
           Don't eat on the floor, buddy.
                         
          Foster stays where he is, slurping cereal from the cup.
          Dalton is playing a handheld videogame. Intensely focused.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Okay, well, please let me know by
           the end of today, I have to give
           the number out. Thank you.
           8.
                         
                         
          She hangs up, pissed.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Foster, get up. Now.
                         
          Foster frowns and obeys.
                         
                          JOSH
                          (TO RENAI)
           How come you were up so early? Was
           Cali crying?
                         
                          RENAI
           You woke me up.
                         
                          JOSH
           What do you mean?
                         
                          RENAI
           You were snoring.
                         
                          JOSH
           No I wasn't.
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes you were.
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't snore.
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes you do.
                         
                          JOSH
           My father snored. I do not snore.
                         
                          RENAI
           How would you know what you do?
           You're asleep.
                         
          Renai marches out of the room. Dalton's game unit beeps
          loudly and he pumps his fist.
                         
                          DALTON
           Yes! I made it to the last level!
           Invisiworld!
                         
          Ever amiable, Josh high five's his son.
                         
                          JOSH
           Good one, champ.
                          (BEAT)
           I don't snore, do I?
           9.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai sees that all the books she unpacked earlier are now
          scattered across the floor of the living room.
                         
                          RENAI
           Where are my bleeping pills?
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, LAMBERT HOME - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai charges in. Josh snatches an apple out of a fruit bowl,
          biting into it. He quickly gags and spits it out into the sink.
                         
                          JOSH
           What the heck is this? Wax?!
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes.
                         
                          JOSH
           Let me get this straight - we have
           no actual fruit but we have wax
           fruit?
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes.
                         
                          JOSH
           That is dangerous. It could kill
           one of our kids.
                         
                          RENAI
           Where are my pills, Josh?
                         
                          JOSH
           Probably where you left them,
           Renai.
                         
          She finds them on the counter, snatching them up.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           See.
                         
                          RENAI
           That's not where I left them.
                         
                          DALTON
           Mom, I need my lunch.
                         
                          RENAI
           Oh, geez. Look, just...take last
           night's dinner.
           10.
                         
                         
          She opens the fridge. It is bare except for a box of sushi.
                         
                          DALTON
           Sushi? Aw, that's weirdo food.
                         
                          RENAI
           It's all we have. Just for today,
           honey.
                         
                          JOSH
           Check it first, Dalton. It's
           probably made out of Styrofoam.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (TO DALTON)
           And while I've got you, if you're
           going to look at my books, please
           don't leave them all over the floor.
                         
                          DALTON
           I didn't touch your books.
                         
          Josh streaks past, kissing Renai on the cheek.
                         
                          JOSH
           I gotta go.
                         
                          RENAI
           Are you taking the boys to school?
                         
                          JOSH
           No time.
                         
                          RENAI
           Well can you pick them up after
           school?
                         
                          JOSH
           Not today.
                         
                          RENAI
           But I have stuff I wanted to...
                         
          She trails off. He's gone. Foster BURPS. Loudly.
                         
                          FOSTER
           Can I have another cup, mom?
                         
                         
          INT. CLASSROOM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          Noisy students settle into their desks. Inner city kids,
          mostly Hispanic.
           11.
                         
                         
          Josh is their teacher, scribbling on the blackboard. One
          student, a lanky boy, ALANSO (16), hovers near the door.
                         
                          JOSH
           Alanso, please sit down.
                         
                          ALANSO
           No entiendo.
                         
                          JOSH
           Siéntate, por favor.
                         
          Alanso takes a seat. Josh is having trouble getting control.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Come on guys, quieten down.
                         
          A pretty girl in the front, TERI, is annoyed at the class.
                         
                          TERI
           You better all shut up.
                         
          She commands respect. They do. Except for one kid.
                         
           THE ONE KID
           Just cos you're in love.
                         
                          JOSH
           Thank you, Teri. Today we are going
           to talk about Darwin. It's a city in
           Australia, but it's also the last
           name of which famous naturalist?
                         
                          MALE STUDENT # 1
           Charles Darwin.
                         
                          JOSH
           Correct. Does anybody know what he
           is famous for?
                         
                          MALE STUDENT # 1
           He said that people descended from
           monkeys.
                         
                          JOSH
           Half right. He wrote a seminal book
           that explained his theories on
           natural selection, and how the
           different species on this planet -
           including humans - evolved.
                         
                          ALANSO
           I know I didn't evolve from no
           monkey. Shit.
           12.
                         
                         
          Everyone laughs.
                         
                          JOSH
           Humans actually have a lot in
           common with monkeys, or more
           specifically, chimpanzees.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Maybe you do, but I was created in
           the image of my Dios.
                         
          He takes a gold cross hanging on a necklace out of his shirt,
          kissing it and holding it up. That gets another laugh.
                         
                          JOSH
           I respect your right to believe
           that, Alanso. But I want to give
           you all possible theories. I want
           this class to go out into the world
           with an informed opinion.
                         
                          ALANSO
           The theory is incorrect, Mr. Lambert.
                         
                          JOSH
           How can it be incorrect? It's a
           theory. A scientific theory.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Yeah, well, science is bullshit. We
           didn't get here cos of no test-tubes.
                         
                          JOSH
           Alanso, if you keep talking like
           that I'm going to ask you to visit
           the principal.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Fine.
                         
          He gets up and leaves as the class JEERS and BOOS.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - DAY
                         
          Peace and quiet at last.
                         
          Renai gropes in behind the bookcase, plucking a hidden jewelry
          box free. She pinches a cigarette out of it and lights it.
                         
          She sits down at her piano, feeling the keys, warming her
          fingers up. Sunlight streams in through the windows.
                         
          She takes out a notebook, filled with scribbled handwriting.
           13.
                         
                         
          She places the notebook on the sheetstand, then sets a small,
          mechanical METRONOME in motion and begins tapping out a sombre
          melody in time with it.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (SINGING)
           Yeah, I'm looking west, always been
           looking that way, gonna get it all
           happening, just can't do it today...
                         
          She stops and makes a note in her book. She starts over,
          rising to the emotion of the song. She's got a good voice.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
                          (SINGING)
           Yeah, I'm looking west, always been
           looking that way, I'm gonna be
           somebody, I just can't be her today--
                         
          She is interrupted by the tinny sound of a baby crying.
                         
          She stops playing and looks over at a baby monitor, the
          source of the noise.
                         
          Renai deflates, her shoulders sagging in defeat. She closes
          her notebook and leaves the room.
                         
                         
          INT. CALI'S NURSERY - DAY
                         
          Renai scoops up Cali, rocking her gently.
                         
          A scratching sound interrupts. Rough. Frantic. Like a dog
          pawing at something.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai steps into the hall, curious. She can still hear it.
          She follows the sound to a door. Grabs the door handle.
                         
          The sound abruptly ceases.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The door whines open and stabs a blade of light onto a set of
          stairs that descend into a gloomy basement.
                         
          Renai stands at the top of the stairs, squinting into the
          inky blackness, straining to see.
                         
          She reaches up and yanks a light chain, illuminating a bare
          bulb and throwing light across the tenebrous space.
           14.
                         
                         
          The basement is large and completely bare. Cleaned out.
                         
          Renai takes a step down. She is still carrying Cali.
                         
          FURTHER DOWN below her, we see that there is one step that is
          cracked and broken.
                         
          She takes another step. The broken step is right below her now.
                         
          One more step and she will fall.
                         
          Cali squeals happily. Renai pauses...then turns around,
          heading back up the stairs. Stops when she sees something.
                         
          DEEP, VIOLENT SCRATCH MARKS...running downwards on the inside
          of the door...as if someone were trying to claw their way out.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          A Spanish-style home. Very pretty. This is not the suburbs.
          More of an inner city neighborhood. There's history here.
                         
          Josh pulls into the driveway of his new house in his Subaru.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          The house almost looks liveable.
                         
          Foster is watching loud, zany cartoons on TV. Cali is in a
          high chair. Renai is folding boxes. She has unpacked most of
          the living room and is very tired.
                         
          Josh ambles in, sees the work Renai has done.
                         
                          JOSH
           Look at this. Nice job.
                         
          Foster bolts over and crashes into his dads legs, hugging him.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Whoa, buddy. Slow down.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh, where's the box of my lamps?
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't know. They should be here.
           We packed them up.
                         
                          RENAI
           Yeah, I packed them. They're not here.
           15.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           I remember the movers bringing them
           in and putting them right there.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE)
           Well, they're not here. I would
           know, I've been unpacking this
           stuff all day.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          Dalton wanders the hall, sporting a red superhero CAPE and
          carrying a plastic, glowing light-sabre toy.
                         
          He reaches a door. The basement door. He pulls it open.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Dalton holds up his light-sabre, the glow allowing him to
          make out the murky corners of the basement below.
                         
          He takes a step down the stairs. Then another step.
                         
          The broken step is right below him.
                         
          He steps again --
                         
          -- and falls. Flails forward, tumbling down the steps, all
          the way to the bottom. His light sabre SHATTERS.
                         
          He hits the ground, his head smacking the floor.
                         
          All is dark.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Josh sits with Foster, zoned out in front of the droning TV.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Pitch black.
                         
          Dazed, Dalton sits up. His head is cut and bleeding. He is
          alone in the dark. He stares into the corner of the
          surrounding cell.
                         
          His eyes adjust, making out a shape.
                         
          A shadow.
           16.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME
                         
          Josh and Renai look up as the quiet is shattered by a SCREAM.
                         
          They spring into action, scrambling to their feet.
                         
                          RENAI
           Dalton? Where are you?
                         
          He doesn't answer. Just keeps screaming.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Renai and Josh whip the door open, glaring into the basement
          from the top of the stairs.
                         
                          RENAI
           Dalton?
                         
          Dalton is crumpled at the bottom of the steps, sobbing, his
          red cape gathered around him.
                         
          Renai flicks the light on. Her and Josh scamper down the
          steps, propping Dalton up.
                         
                          JOSH
           What happened?
                         
                          DALTON
           I fell.
                         
                          RENAI
           Dalton, you have to be careful. You
           shouldn't be coming down here in
           the dark.
                         
                          JOSH
           Where do you hurt the most?
                         
                          DALTON
           My knee and my head. I can't stand
           up.
                         
          Josh lifts him to his feet. A severely grazed knee is dotted
          with blood. He's okay.
                         
                          JOSH
           You scared us, champ.
                         
          Josh carries him up the stairs as he sucks in sobs.
                         
          Renai glances around the basement, her eyes landing on the
          lone object that resides in it.
           17.
                         
                         
          She frowns. It wasn't there when she saw the basement last.
                         
          It is a box. One of her large, cardboard moving boxes.
                         
          It is marked LAMPS.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Dalton is lying in bed, a band-aid slapped across his
          forehead. Renai tucks him in, Josh standing over him.
                         
                          JOSH
           You're lucky you don't need stitches.
                         
                          RENAI
           If I catch you falling down the
           stairs again I'm gonna break your
           neck.
                         
                          DALTON
           That doesn't make sense.
                         
          There are dozens of pictures tacked to the wall, all drawn by
          Dalton. Josh taps one; a drawing of Dalton flying through the
          night sky, wearing his cape.
                         
                          DALTON (CONT'D)
           You might be a superhero but you're
           not invincible. Be more careful, bud.
                         
          Renai kisses him and gets up.
                         
                          RENAI
           Sleep tight, honey.
                         
          They wave goodbye and turn out the light.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai flops into bed beside Josh, exhausted.
                         
                          JOSH
           We've gotta lock that door.
                         
                          RENAI
           He's such a boy. He goes off
           exploring. Sometimes I wanna keep
           him on one of those child leashes.
                         
                          JOSH
           Why bother with a child leash? I'll
           stop at the pet store tomorrow.
           18.
                         
                         
          She laughs and cuddles up to him, resting her head on his chest.
                         
                          RENAI
           I'm sorry I was pissy when you got
           home. I was trying to work on a
           song today and then Cali woke up
           and wouldn't stop crying...
                         
                          JOSH
           I didn't even notice.
                         
                          RENAI
           I feel guilty for wanting my own
           time.
                         
                          JOSH
           It's normal to want your own time.
                         
                          RENAI
           Is it? My mother gave up everything
           for me. I keep waiting for the
           completely selfless parent gene to
           kick in, but I'm exactly the same
           person I was when I was 22, only
           now I'm married with kids.
                         
                          JOSH
           You're a great mother.
                         
                          RENAI
           No, I'm not. They like you so much
           better than me.
                         
                          JOSH
           That's not true.
                         
                          RENAI
           You're the cool dad who comes home
           with presents and I'm the one who
           yells at them all day.
                         
                          JOSH
           Now you're being crazy. They love
           you. At least you get to connect
           with them. I work so much.
                         
                          RENAI
           Believe me, you're their hero. They
           try to play us off against each
           other. They're master manipulators.
           I guess they really are my kids.
                         
          Josh laughs. A lull settles over them.
           19.
                         
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Is this it, Josh?
                         
                          JOSH
           Is this so bad?
                         
          She doesn't answer. They sit in silence for a long beat.
                         
                          RENAI
           Thank you for letting me take some time
           off to work on my music again.
                         
                          JOSH
           We'll get by. I want you to do it.
                         
                          RENAI
           There's a couple of songs...I mean
           not all of them, but there's a
           couple of them that I think are
           really good. And I think, maybe I
           could do something with them.
                         
                          JOSH
           I love all your songs.
                         
          They kiss.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          It is 3AM. All the remoteness of that hour is present
          here...we can feel it.
                         
          As still and quiet as deep space.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          The formerly bustling kitchen is now a museum at midnight.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          A long, dark thoroughfare. A ticking clock its only occupant.
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Stairs swallowed up by darkness. The groan of settling wood.
                         
                         
          INT. FOSTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The soft breathing of a sleeping child.

          Hanging toy birds dangle over the baby, tinkling in a breeze.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Dalton is sleeping too. Impossibly still. Lying on his back.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai and Josh are entwined together. Josh is snoring. They
          are both blissfully asleep...
                         
          ...for now.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
                         
          Another day, another chaotic breakfast.
                         
          Foster waves a stuffed toy around. Josh charges in, bits of
          tissue on his face from shaving cuts. Cali flails her arms in
          her high chair. Renai is at the sink, whisking eggs.
                         
                          RENAI
           Foster, sit down honey.
                         
          She whips a look around.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Where is...? Hey Josh, could you go
           wake up Dalton?
                         
          We FOLLOW Josh as he marches down the corridor to Dalton's
          bedroom, poking his head inside.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh knocks on the wall.
                         
                          JOSH
           Time to get up, my man. Come on.
                         
          Nothing from Dalton. He doesn't even stir. Josh rolls his
          eyes and walks in. Nudges Dalton with his knee.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You're making me look bad here.
           Outta bed before your mother comes
           in and kills both of us.
           21.
                         
                         
          Nothing. He's really out.
                         
          Josh reaches down and shakes Dalton vigorously.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton, get up. You've gotta get
           ready for school.
                         
          Josh waits for a response, but none comes. Dalton is as slack
          as a puppet. Something resembling concern crosses Josh's face.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton...?
                         
          He kneels down, shaking Dalton hard. He listens for breathing.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton? Dalton?! DALTON!!
                         
          His scream takes us into--
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, ICU UNIT - DAY
                         
          --the stern sterility of a hospital.
                         
          Josh and Renai, eyes lined by dark circles, stand in front of
          a dour neurologist, DR. JOEL SERCARZ (46).
                         
          Renai dabs her eyes with a tissue. They are red with tears.
          Beyond a window in front of them, lying on a gurney in an ICU
          chamber, is the unconscious body of Dalton.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           Okay...as of yet, our tests have
           not drawn any conclusive answers
           for you. Repeated blood and CSF
           cultures are normal, making an
           infective origin highly unlikely.
           Tests for Lyme disease and repeated
           polymerase chain reaction are
           negative. Systemic vasculitis was
           ruled out. Dalton remains in an
           areactive coma without focal signs
           or abnormal brainstem reflexes.
                         
          Josh and Renai struggle to follow the cold, multi-syllable
          medical terminology...like stranded tourists keeping up with
          a foreign language.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)
           We've looked for bacterial
           pathogens like Meningoencephalitis,
           but haven't seen anything.
                          (MORE)
           22.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)
           I wouldn't say we've exhausted
           every single angle...but we're
           close. The underlying cause is
           still unknown.
                         
          Josh and Renai look in at their boy.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)
           The good news is that he's
           breathing without the use of a
           mechanical apparatus, and there are
           no lesions or hemorrhages in any of
           the CT scans.
                         
                          JOSH
           So...there's no brain damage or...?
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           None that we've detected. Technically,
           he's in a coma. He doesn't respond to
           stimuli, he has no sleep-wake cycle, but
           there's no brain trauma or infection. His
           scans are normal. To be honest, I've
           never seen anything like it.
                         
                          JOSH
           That fall he took...I mean, it looked
           like he hit his head pretty hard.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           We definitely exhausted that
           possibility, but it was always
           doubtful. The cut was superficial,
           there wasn't even a skull fracture.
                         
                          RENAI
           He can't just not wake up...there's
           got to be something...
                         
          Renai sobs, tears streaming down her face. Josh looks like a
          deer in the headlights. Stunned dumb.
                         
          Sercarz clears his throat. This part of the job isn't his
          specialty.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           I'm sorry.
                         
                          JOSH
           So what do we do now? Does he stay here?
                         
           DR. SERCARZ
           We'll conduct some further testing, but
           beyond that...I really don't know.
           23.
                         
                         
          His pager goes off. He checks it.
                         
           DR. SERCARZ (CONT'D)
           Excuse me for a minute. I have to
           step out. A nurse will be with you
           in just a moment.
                         
          He leaves quickly. Josh and Renai press on the glass,
          separated in body and spirit from their son.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.

          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, LAMBERT HOME - DAY
                         
          A ghastly meld of hospital room and young boys bedroom.
                         
          Dalton lies on his bed, a heart rate monitor hooked to his
          chest. IV tubes run into his arms, a Nasogastric feeding tube
          into his mouth.
                         
          A young nurse, ADELE CHALFIN (30), checks the various tubes
          as Renai watches on.
                         
                          ADELE
           Are you having any more trouble
           with the feeding tube?
                         
          Renai looks broken, the life drained from her. A wilted flower.
          She shakes her head, her voice a low rasp.
                         
                          RENAI
                          (BARELY AUDIBLE)
           It's okay.
                         
                          ADELE
           Alright, well I'll be back soon.
           I'll bring some new books. You're
           probably sick of the ones you have.
                         
                          RENAI
           Did he respond to any of the tests?
                         
          Adele pauses.
                         
                          ADELE
           No...no, he didn't. But we have to
           give it time. I've seen coma
           patients with a much longer
           inactivity time suddenly start
           making noises.
           24.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           He's not in a coma, remember? They
           don't know what to call it. They
           don't know what to do with him so
           they've given up.
                         
                          ADELE
           No, they haven't. We're going to
           figure it out.
                         
          Adele hugs her, then exits. Renai slumps down on a chair next
          to her son.
                         
          The heart rate monitor pings. Dalton is as still as a statue.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
                         
          Renai shuffles down the corridor. She passes a bedroom door,
          then stops and doubles back, pushing it open and going into--
                         
                         
          INT. CALI'S NURSERY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --the babies room.
                         
          She stares into the crib...at her other sleeping baby. She
          sets the baby monitor and walks out softly.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Renai slumps in front of her piano. Taps one of the keys.
                         
          She plays a discordant melody of low notes with one hand, not
          present enough to hear it.
                         
          She stops and buries her face in her hands.
                         
          Then she hears it. Whispering.
                         
          It's so low you would miss it if the house wasn't absolutely
          silent. Renai looks up, scanning for the source of the murmur.
                         
          It is coming from the baby monitor.
                         
          Confused, Renai picks up the monitor, turning up the volume
          all the way up. The hissssssss of static fills the room.
                         
          She presses her ear to the device, then hears it again - a
          hushed WHISPER, almost indistinct from the static save for
          the whistle of sibilants.
           25.
                         
                         
                          VOICE
                          (FROM MONITOR)
           They see us...all of us...we have to be
           quick...this life begs us to come back.
                         
          The whisper trails off....more static...
                         
                          VOICE (CONT'D)
                          (FROM MONITOR)
           NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
                         
          Renai drops the baby monitor, leaping out of her skin at the
          sound of the scream. Nerves fried.
                         
          The monitor smashes on the floor. All is quiet.
                         
          Renai moves to the door, staring down the corridor at the
          door to Cali's nursery.
                         
          It is open only a crack. She hears crying. Cali is crying.
                         
          We follow her as she bolts towards the nursery, smashing
          through the door, eyes filled with terror, seeing--
                         
          --nothing.

          Renai stalks into the room.
                         
          The room is empty, save for Cali, crying in her crib. Renai's
          eyes land on the closet.
                         
          ANGLE FROM INSIDE THE CLOSET
                         
          Through a slight crack, we see Renai approach. Breath
          quivering. Her hand reaches out. She FLINGS the door open.
                         
          It is empty.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          The family is eating. It's very quiet.
                         
          Foster keeps his eyes down as his parents eat in silence.
          Suddenly Cali breaks the quiet, squealing happily.
                         
                          CALI
           Dadda!
                         
          Josh looks up, smiling. Amazed.
           26.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           She said dad...
                         
          Neither Renai nor Foster even look up.
                         
                         
          INT. FOSTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          A bedside lamp gives off a jaundice glow.
                         
          Renai gathers up scattered toys from the floor, relocating
          them to a desktop covered in beakers and lab equipment.
                         
          Foster lies in bed beneath a large chart of the solar system.
                         
          Renai stops cleaning when she finds a certificate, crumpled
          next to a school bag. It says IN RECOGNITION OF SCIENCE
          SKILL, AWARDED TO FOSTER LAMBERT ON 3/14/10.
                         
                          RENAI
           What's this?
                         
                          FOSTER
           An award.
                         
                          RENAI
           That's today's date. You got this
           today?
                         
          Foster nods meekly.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Why didn't you tell us, honey?
                         
          She sits on the edge of his bed. He stares at the wall. She
          strokes his hair.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           I know it's hard right now. But
           things will get better. I promise.
                         
          Foster nods.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           I'm going to show this to your dad.
                         
          She plants a kiss his forehead and stands up.
                         
                          FOSTER
           I'm scared, mom.
                         
                          RENAI
           Scared of what?
           27.
                         
                         
                          FOSTER
           Dalton.
                         
          Renai sits back down.
                         
                          RENAI
           We're all scared. It's normal to be
           scared for him. But we can't give up--
                         
                          FOSTER
           Why do I have to sleep so close to
           him? Can't I change rooms?
                         
                          RENAI
           Why would you wanna change rooms?
                         
          Foster swallows.
                         
                          FOSTER
           I don't know.
                         
          Renai stares at her son. She kisses him again.
                         
                          RENAI
           Your brother needs you. Goodnight
           honey.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Josh lies in bed, reading Foster's award. Renai is beside him.
                         
                          RENAI
           Something happened today. I didn't
           want to tell you in front of Foster.
                         
                          JOSH
           What?
                         
                          RENAI
           I heard something coming from
           Cali's room. A man's voice. On the
           baby monitor...it scared the hell
           outta me. I went in there and no
           one was there.
                         
                          JOSH
           Could it have been interference?
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't know. It was so clear. I
           was sitting at the piano and I
           heard this...whispering on the baby
           monitor. So I held my ear up to it--
           28.
                         
                         
          SUDDENLY - a noise interrupts. An arrhythmic KNOCKING sound,
          like a drunk pounding on a tavern door after closing.
                         
          It is the front door.
                         
                          JOSH
           Who the hell is that?
                         
          Josh knows it's his job to check, but he doesn't want to.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Stay here.
                         
          He gets up.
                         
                         
          INT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
                         
          Josh approaches the front door, flashlight in hand. He peers
          through curtains at the front step.
                         
          It's too dark to see anything.
                         
                          JOSH
           Hello? Who's there?
                         
          Only the wind replies.
                         
          He aims the flashlight at the glass, shining it into the
          thick darkness. There is no one on the front step.
                         
          Josh presses the flashlight against the window, arcing the
          beam across his front garden. Leans in close to the glass...
                         
                         AND THEN--
                         
          Nothing. There's no one there.
                         
          He makes sure the door is locked, then flips open a security
          system panel on the wall, pecking at the buttons on it.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai sits up in bed, listening. Hears nothing...
                         
          ...until the low moans of a baby crying float out of the baby
          monitor. Renai hurls the sheet aside.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
                         
          Renai pads down the hall, tentative.
           29.
                         
                         
          She reaches the open door to Cali's room. Sees the silhouette
          of Josh standing over Cali's crib. Exhales with relief.
                         
                          RENAI
           Who was it, Josh?
                         
          Josh appears at the opposite end of the hallway.
                         
                          JOSH
           What did you say?
                         
          Renai SCREAMS as the silhouette recedes into the shadows.
                         
                          RENAI
           There's someone in there!
                         
          She RUNS towards Josh.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           There's someone in Cali's room!
                         
          Josh BOLTS down the hall, flicking on the light, terrified.
                         
          The nursery is empty. Cali is sleeping. Terrified, Josh
          enters the room. Scans around. Only toys and colorful
          wallpaper.
                         
          He steps in further. He's not cut out for this.
                         
          SHRIEEEEEEEEEEEKKKK!!!!!! SHRIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!!!!!
                         
          The house alarm screams to deafening life, shaving a few
          years off Josh's life in the process. He JOLTS, whipping
          around.
                         
                          JOSH
                          (TO RENAI)
           Grab Cali and Foster!
                         
          Josh charges down the hall into the--
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --snatching up a fire poker from the fireplace and continuing--
                         
                         
          INT. FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          -- to the front door, which is swinging open. Holding the
          fire poker aloft, Josh scans the area.
                         
          Renai races past, carrying Cali and dragging Foster behind
          her. They barrel toward Dalton's room.
           30.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh scans the kitchen. It is empty.
                         
          The alarm wails in the background.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh inches his way up the hall, hand shaking.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai holds Foster and Cali close to her. Dalton is lying
          behind them.
                         
          Directly across from Dalton's room is the laundry. The door
          is ajar, offering a view into the darkened room beyond.
                         
          Renai sees something in the dark...a figure. A boy.
                         
          It looks like Dalton. He reaches out to Renai--
                         
          --until another HAND...a pale hand...reaches across and shuts
          the laundry door, sealing the boy off from her view.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh! The laundry!
                         
                         
          INT. LAUNDRY - SAME TIME
                         
          Josh bolts up the hall, panicked. He reaches the laundry
          door, grabbing the handle. Hesitates.
                         
          He propels the door open with a shove, flicking on the light.
                         
          The room is empty. No windows, no doors for escape...just a
          washing machine and a dryer.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          A home security officer trudges down the steps of the house.
                         
          Renai, Josh, Foster and Cali all stand outside in their
          pajamas, shivering in the frigid night air.
                         
                          SECURITY OFFICER
           There's no one in there, it's all
           clear. If someone was there, they're
           gone now.
           31.
                         
                         
          Renai steps away from the children, out of their earshot.
                         
                          RENAI
           I saw somebody.
                         
                          SECURITY OFFICER
           Maybe it was a shadow...?
                         
                          RENAI
           No. It wasn't a shadow, it was a
           man. He was tall, and he long,
           greasy hair. He was wearing a grey
           jacket. He looked right at me.
                         
                          SECURITY OFFICER
           Well, like I said...he's gone now.
                         
          Renai looks to the others. Sees only disbelieving faces.
                         
                         
          INT. GYMNASIUM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          Josh's students scuffle about on stadium seating, arranging
          themselves for a CLASS PHOTO. They're not doing a great job.
                         
          A male photographer does his best to compose them, not doing a
          great job of hiding his bitterness about the fact that he's
          shooting school photos instead of Vanity Fair spreads.
                         
                          PHOTOGRAPHER
           Okay, face the front ladies and
           gentlemen...come on...hold still...
           (muttering to himself)
           I'm trying to record the peak of
           your pathetic lives here.
                         
          Josh stands off to the side, lost in his own thoughts. Tired.
                         
                          PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
           Mr. Lambert, would you like to step
           in please?
                         
          Josh snaps out of his own head.
                         
                          JOSH
           Uh...what?
                         
                          PHOTOGRAPHER
           Could you step in so that we can
           take the photo? Quickly please.
                         
                          JOSH
           Just take it without me.

           We need you in the photo, sir.
                         
                          JOSH
           No, you don't. Just take the damn
           photo without me, okay?
                         
          The class settles down, shocked by the outburst. Chastened,
          the photographer turns to the class, gripping the camera
          trigger.
                         
                          PHOTOGRAPHER
           I can't believe this is my life.
           (beat; to class)
           Ready kids? Say asshole teacher!
                         
                         
          INT. GYMNASIUM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - LATER
                         
          The students file out of the gym. Josh sits in the bleachers,
          head buried in his hands.
                         
           ALANSO (O.S.)
           I hear things.
                         
          Josh looks up, seeing Alanso.
                         
                          JOSH
           What?
                         
                          ALANSO
           I spend so much time in the office,
           I hear things. I heard about your
           son. I'm sorry.
                         
                          JOSH
           Thank you, Alanso.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Times like these...people realize
           that science doesn't have all the
           answers. There is a higher force at
           work.
                         
                          JOSH
           I wish I had your belief. Things
           would be a lot simpler.
                         
                          ALANSO
           Things are simple. You just can't
           see it. Put your faith in Him.
                         
          He places his gold cross necklace in Josh's hand, then leaves.
          Josh watches him go, then takes out his cell phone.
           33.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Hey...I just found out I have to
           stay back tonight and finish off
           mid-term grades. It could be a
           while, there's a lot to go through.
           Don't wait up. Bye.
                         
                         
          EXT. PARK - NIGHT
                         
          Josh sits on a park bench, staring into the distance. He
          takes out a flask of whisky, swigging from it.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai lies in bed, staring at the ceiling. Alone.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                         
          Renai shuffles in, pouring herself a glass of water. Then she
          hears it. A low muttering. It is coming from Dalton's room.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
                         
          Unnerved, Renai peers through the open door. Josh is sitting
          beside Dalton's bed, reading to him.
                         
                          JOSH
           The men all walked down to the
           waters edge...and they stood there
           and asked the beast to come forth.
           And the beast roared back "No!". And
           so they dived in after it...
                         
                         
          EXT. LAMBERT HOME
                         
          In the sunlight, the house looks like a happy place.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Dalton's face is a picture of serenity.
                         
          A new day-shift nurse, KELLY (29), checks on his feeding
          tube. Renai watches from the doorway.
                         
                          KELLY
           You okay?
           34.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           Yeah.
                         
                          KELLY
           I was going to head off for an hour
           or so. Are you alright here?
                         
                          RENAI
           Of course. Anything from Dalton?
                         
                          KELLY
           No. I'm sorry.
                         
          Renai nods. Her eyes brim with tears. The cracks are showing.
                         
                          KELLY (CONT'D)
           Keep providing him with stimuli. I've
           seen it work time and time again.
           Read to him. Even if you're doing
           something else, you can play him
           music that he likes. Don't give up.
                         
          She throws a scarf over her shoulder and stands.
                         
                          RENAI
           I won't, I just...I haven't slept
           much the last couple of nights. I
           feel like the universe is trying to
           see how far I can bend before I
           break.
                         
                          KELLY
           The universe picked a fight with
           the wrong chick.
                         
                          RENAI
           Thanks, Kelly. You're a saint.
                         
                          KELLY
           No, I'm not. I'm doing my job. I
           chose to be here. You didn't choose
           any of this. You're the strong one.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Renai surveys the living room. It is a total mess.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM - DAY
                         
          Water cascades out of a faucet. Steam rises from the water.
           35.
                         
                         
          Renai lets bath salts fall into the tub. She almost looks
          relaxed just smelling them.
                         
          She starts to undress, then turns --
                         
          -- and YELPS in fright.
                         
          A person is standing behind the distorted glass window,
          staring in at her.
                         
          The shape of the person's head and shoulders can clearly be
          seen, but the glass is too opaque to make out any features.
                         
          Renai slips, grabbing the sink. When she glances up, the
          figure is gone.
                         
          Trembling, Renai opens the window. Very, very slowly.
                         
          It is fifteen feet off the ground, with a sheer drop below it.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAMBERT HOME - NIGHT
                         
          Renai sits on the front steps, alone. It is late. She looks
          somehow tired and wired at the same time. Smoking a cigarette.
                         
          Josh pulls in. Fumbles out of his car, tipsy.
                         
                          JOSH
           What are you doing up?
                         
                          RENAI
           It's midnight, Josh.
                         
                          JOSH
           When did you start smoking?
                         
                          RENAI
           You've been coming home late every
           single night. You've never had to
           do that in all of the years you've
           been at the school. Now all of a
           sudden you have to stay back late?
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't like it either, but I'm
           grading tests. What choice do I have?
           We've gotta pay Dalton's bills.
                         
                          RENAI
           Your mother is paying Dalton's
           bills, Josh. I know because she
           reminds me every chance she gets.
           36.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           Jesus, I can't win with you. That's
           my son in there too, not just yours!
                         
          He paces, the anger sobering him.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I've always felt like less than
           good enough for you. I feel it
           every time you mention our bills.
           That subtle voice that says `can't
           you get a job that pays more than a
           teacher'? And now I can't even look
           at you without feeling it.
                         
                          RENAI
           You're projecting that onto me.
           You've written an entire story
           about I'm how I'm feeling without
           once asking me how I'm feeling.
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't need to ask. I know you.
                         
                          RENAI
           I am losing my mind here in this
           house, Josh. I'm scared and I need
           you and you're not here. Where are
           you?
                         
                          JOSH
           I told you, I'm grading tests.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't mean that. I mean you're
           not here. With me. In this
           situation. You're avoiding it, like
           you do anything stressful, whether
           it's this or a parking ticket.
                         
                          JOSH
           Christ, I should have stayed at the
           school.
                         
                          RENAI
           There you go again.
                         
          Renai stands up and walks inside the house. The door closes.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Josh tosses a pillow onto the couch, setting himself up for
          the night. He curls up on it, pulling a blanket over himself.
           37.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
                         
          The witching hour. Still. Quiet...save for the omnipresent
          clock.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Dalton is as still as we've seen him. And then...he twitches.
          A slight facial twitch, but we see it.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Josh snoozes, head arched at a bad angle. His back will
          regret sleeping on this couch.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Renai tosses and turns, restless in sleep.
                         
          Her eyes open and she sucks in a breath. Bad dreams.
                         
          She blinks and looks around the room, surprised to be alone,
          sitting up in fright. Until she remembers why. She eases back
          onto the bed. Then she looks over at the window.
                         
          There is a man standing outside it.
                         
          He is not looking in at her...he is pacing back and forth,
          furiously smoking a cigarette. Back and forth, back and
          forth. Agitated. He has long, black, greasy hair and a grey
          jacket.
                         
          Every muscle in Renai's body freezes. She becomes a glacier.
                         
          Her eyes are drilled to the man, unable to move. By sheer
          will, she manages to direct them towards the bedroom door.
          Opens her mouth but no words will come. Finally--
                         
                          RENAI
           Jo....osh....Josh....Josh...
                         
          She glances back at the window.
                         
          THE MAN IS NOW IN THE ROOM.
                         
          He paces back and forth between the bed and the window, just
          as he was outside, ignoring Renai. Smoking like a fiend.
                         
          And then, suddenly, he stops pacing. Looks up. Straight at
          Renai - as if just realizing she was there.
           38.
                         
                         
          For a moment their eyes are locked in silence...
                         
          ...and then the man's face contorts in anger and he CHARGES
          towards her, arms outstretched, GROWLING in fury.
                         
                          MAN
           DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE!
                         
          Renai lets out a SHRIEK of terror that could strip paint. A
          cry from the depths of her soul.
                         
          She propels herself backward, falling off the bed and
          scrambling back into the corner.
                         
          Josh CHARGES into the room, flicking on the light--
                         
          --seeing only Renai, huddled in the corner, screaming.
                         
                          JOSH
           What is it? What is it?!
                         
          Renai is incoherent. She cannot stop screaming. Josh grabs
          her by the shoulders.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Renai, what is wrong?!
                         
                          RENAI
           The man -- he was there -- he tried
           to -- there was a man there!!!
                         
          Foster runs into the room, visibly terrified. He sees his
          mother and instantly begins crying. He runs to his dad,
          holding onto his leg.
                         
          In the background, Cali begins crying, her screams
          contributing to an overwhelming din.
                         
                          JOSH
           There's no one here.
                         
                          RENAI
           I saw somebody!
                         
                          JOSH
           There's no one here.
                         
                          RENAI
           Don't you dare not believe me!
                         
                          JOSH
           I believe you, okay? I just don't
           know what you want me to do.
           39.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           I want you to tell me that we can
           leave this house. I will not spend
           one more night here. I wanna leave,
           I wanna go!
                         
                          FOSTER
           I don't want the man to get me.
                         
          The realization that her child is terrified quiets Renai.
                         
          All is suddenly silent, save for the cries of Cali in the
          background. Josh holds his son tight.
                         
                          JOSH
           You're okay, buddy. I've got you.
                         
          He and Renai exchange a look.
                         
                          RENAI
           I'm sorry.
                          (BEAT)
           I can't...I want to leave this
           house. I can't be here anymore.
                         
                          JOSH
           To move now would be...we would
           have to rent somewhere. It's not--
                         
                          RENAI
           Please, Josh.
                         
                         
          An agreement passes between them.
                         
           FADE TO BLACK.
                         
                         
          EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY
                         
          A moving truck is parked outside an average suburban home.
                         
          Movers mill about, hauling boxes and couches.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Renai unpacks boxes. An elderly woman, LORRAINE (65), helps to
          unpack. This is Josh's mother. She has a curt, disapproving
          manner about her that doesn't always make her easy to love.
                         
          She is actually moving more quickly than Renai, who groans as
          if her back were aching as she stoops down to pick up books.
           40.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           Lorraine, you shouldn't have to do
           any of this. Sit down.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           Nonsense. I'm perfectly capable of
           putting a few things away. I did it
           for Josh his whole life. He never
           was good with tidying up.
                         
                          RENAI
           I know, but I just feel so bad.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           I think it's you who should be
           sitting down by the looks of it.
                         
          She boosts a photo frame from one of the boxes. It is a
          portrait of Renai, Dalton, Foster and Josh. In happier times.
                         
          Lorraine seems taken aback by it.
                         
                          LORRAINE (CONT'D)
           I can't believe you got Josh to sit
           still for a photo.
                         
          Renai reclines against the wall, surveying her new living
          room. Her new new house.
                         
                          RENAI
           I can't believe we're doing all this
           again, that's what I can't believe.
           (beat; looks at her)
           I know you think I'm crazy.
                         
          Lorraine stops unpacking and fixes Renai with a stare. They've
          never really gotten along before. Adversity has brought about
          a truce.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           Nobody - not me, not anybody -
           knows what you're going through
           right now. Whatever you have to do
           to get through it, do it. And never
           apologize for it.
                         
          Renai hugs her. It's a new thing for them and a bit awkward.
                         
                         
          INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          DR. BRYCE TRIMBLE (52) sits opposite Renai and Josh. Spread
          out in front of him are a series of X-Rays, labelled DALTON
          LAMBERT. His office is big and expensive.
           41.
                         
                         
          Renai looks hopeful. Josh looks like a shell of a man.
                         
                          RENAI
           We just wanna say...thank you so
           much. For helping us out with this,
           doctor. We can't tell you how much
           it means to have you involved.
                         
           DR. TRIMBLE
           I'm glad to help.
                          (BEAT)
           Unfortunately...these recent tests
           have proven inconclusive. There's
           absolutely nothing abnormal here.
                         
          Josh and Renai deflate.
                         
                          JOSH
           So...if you're the top of the food
           chain with this stuff, where does
           that leave us?
                         
           DR. TRIMBLE
           I don't know. There is a research
           team in Boston who specialize in a
           new form of treatment. They try to
           stimulate the patients brain with
           electric pulses. It has a good
           success rate with victims of brain
           injury. We could try that.
                         
                          RENAI
           So there's hope?
                         
           DR. TRIMBLE
           There are more things we can try.
                          (BEAT)
           The hope part is up to you.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Renai sits beside Dalton. Staring at him. She runs her
          fingers through his hair, touching his skin.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          A needle touches an LP.
                         
          The pops and crackles of record hiss spit forth, followed by
          the lilting guitar strums of `Tip Toe Through The Tulips'.
                         
          The quavering falsetto of Tiny Tim accompanies the guitar.
           42.

           Tip-toe by the window, by the
           window, that is where I'll be...
                         
          Renai walks away and we follow her down the hall into --
                         
                         
          INT. FOSTER'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          -- a mess as only a child can make.
                         
          Renai picks up a plate and a fork and knife from the floor.
          She walks out and we DON'T CUT, tracking with her --
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          -- back down the hall, towards the kitchen. The records
          continues warbling in the background.

                          (FROM RECORD)
           Oh tip-toe, from the garden, by the
           garden, of the willow tree...
                         
          Renai passes the living room.
                         
          What she doesn't see is the child standing in the middle of
          the room, facing the record player.
                         
          The boy is dressed in clothes from another time, but
          children's clothes just the same.
                         
          He is dancing awkwardly, shifting his weight from one foot to
          foot the other sheepishly, as if trying it for the first
          time.
                         
          Renai keeps walking and we stay with her as she moves past
          the child, following her into the --
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          -- mess of the kitchen.
                         
          She sets the plate down in the sink, on top of a stack of
          other dirty dishes.
                         
          With a sigh she runs the hot water over the dishes.
                         
          With a sudden POP, the record starts skipping.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
           43.
                         
                         
          Renai shuts off the water, heading back to the living room.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          She marches in, annoyed.
                         
          Then freezes.
                         
          Her bookshelf is empty. The books that once sat on it are now
          scattered across the floor.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          Renai scans the books.
                         THEN
                         SHE
                         HEARS
          it...
                         
          Giggling.
                         
          She pivots her head towards the darkened hallway. There, she
          sees a child, hidden in shadow, standing in the hall. Staring
          at her.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          Renai doesn't move. Doesn't breathe.
                         
          And then suddenly, the child turns and runs down the hall,
          disappearing into Dalton's bedroom.
                         
                          RENAI
           Oh my God, Dalton...no...
                         
          Summoning every ounce of strength, Renai troops down the hall
          towards Dalton's room.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          Renai pushes the door open.
                         
          Dalton lies in the center of the room on his gurney. The only
          sound is his breathing.
                         
          Renai surveys the room. It is empty.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          She steps inside, glancing over at a cabinet. In the foot-
          high space beneath it, a small white shoe protrudes slightly.
           44.
                         
                         
          A child's shoe.
                         
          Heart pounding, Renai bends down, peering into the darkness
          under the cabinet.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          The shoe does not have a foot in it. It is simply a discarded
          shoe. There is no one under the cabinet.
                         
          BANG!!!
                         BA G
                         
          The cabinet doors EXPLODE open as the child bursts out,
          giggling. Only we see that it is not a child.
                         
          It is a DWARF. A man in child's clothing. The dwarf runs past
          Renai as she LEAPS back. He runs out of the room, giggling.
          All is quiet again.
                         
          Bump...bump...bump...
                         
          Renai gets up, unsure of what to do. Numb with terror.
                         
          SUDDENLY-- the record pitches back to life, the volume
          startling. Renai JOLTS, falling backwards.
                         
                         
          INT. CLASSROOM, FORRESTER HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT
                         
          A darkened class room.
                         
          An older janitor, NED (68), shoulders the door open, carrying a
          mop. He STARTS when he sees Josh, sitting at his desk in the
          pale light of a desk lamp. Alone.
                         
                          NED
           Josh...didn't see you there.
                         
                          JOSH
           Sorry to scare you.
                         
                          NED
           What are you up to this late?
                         
          Josh holds up his flask of whisky. He's a bit soused.
                         
                          JOSH
           Where did all the bartenders who
           listen to your troubles go, Ned?
                         
          Ned nods sagely. He sets down his mop and grabs a chair,
          sitting in front of Josh with a sigh. He takes the flask.
           45.
                         
                         
                          NED
           Never drink alone. If you take the
           dirty jokes out of drunkenness, all
           you're left with is the self loathing.
                         
          He downs a hit from the flask, then hands it back.
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't need whisky for that.
                         
                          NED
           Bah. You people think too much.
           Used to be, if life threw a
           shitstorm at you, you'd grab the
           nearest umbrella. Your generation
           would spend a day googling what
           brand to buy.
                         
          Josh laughs despite himself.
                         
                          JOSH
           I probably would too.
           (beat; takes a drink)
           It's funny, I've always known I was
           the type of person that things
           didn't happen to. I made peace with
           it. I thought to myself, it's okay -
           I'll never win the lottery or climb
           Mount Everest...but I'll never get
           a rare tropical blood disease
           either. It works out.
                          (BEAT)
           Now I'm the guy whose son is in a
           mysterious coma.
                         
                          NED
           Things happen to everybody. Even to
           good people like you. And they're
           gonna keep happening the older you
           get, believe me. No use sittin' in
           the dark drinkin' over it. Go home.
           Be with your wife. Tell her your
           what's on your mind.
                         
          He takes the flask and has another swig.
                         
                          NED (CONT'D)
           There sure as hell isn't any
           umbrellas `round here.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Josh pulls up to the house. Turns off the car.
           46.
                         
                         
          An old Cadillac is sitting in the driveway. Josh clambers out
          of his car and peers in through the window of the Cadillac,
          quizzical.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Renai is huddled on the couch in the living room, gripping her
          knees to her chest. A man is sitting next to her; a handsome,
          soft-spoken Anglican priest, FATHER NATHANSON (40).
                         
          Josh enters. There are subtle changes in his coordination and
          speech from the booze.
                         
                          JOSH
           This is the first line of a joke.
           Guy comes home to find his wife
           with a priest...
                         
          Father Nathanson stands, as does Renai.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh, this is Liam Nathanson. A
           very old friend of mine.
                         
                          FATHER NATHANSON
           Nice to meet you. I've heard a lot
           about you.
                         
                          JOSH
           Can't say I've heard the same,
           Liam. At least I know you're not
           sleeping with her.
                         
           LORRAINE (O.S.)
           Don't be rude, Josh.
                         
          Josh turns to see his mother, holding a tray of tea. He frowns.
                         
                          JOSH
           What is going on here?
                         
                          FATHER NATHANSON
           I should be going. Thank you so much
           for the tea.
                         
                          RENAI
           Thanks, Liam.
                         
          He clears his throat and exits, quickly and quietly.
                         
                          JOSH
           Okay, would anyone mind telling me
           what the hell is going on here?
           47.
                         
                         
                          LORRAINE
          Please sit down, Joshua.
                         
                          JOSH
          "Joshua?" Oh Jesus...
                         
                          LORRAINE
          Sit down.
                         
                          JOSH
          The melodramatic way in which you
          two are conducting yourselves right
          now is scaring the shit out of me,
          so just tell me what's wrong.
                         
                          LORRAINE
          Nothing is wrong. We want to talk.
                         
                          JOSH
          Nobody asks you to sit down unless
          something is wrong. If a doctor
          calls you into his office and asks
          you to sit down, you're fucked.
                         
                          RENAI
          There's no use, Lorraine. He's been
          drinking.
                         
                          JOSH
          I have not been drinking. Not
          enough that we can't talk to each
          other, Renai. And don't judge me in
          that bitchy tone, okay?
                         
                          RENAI
                          (TO LORRAINE)
          He would never speak to me like
          that before.
                         
                          JOSH
          Christ. You're acting like I'm some
          lush who comes home and beats you
          with a belt. At least I'm speaking
          to you. You suddenly have to speak
          to a priest. Or my mother who, up
          until a couple of weeks ago, you
          couldn't stand.
                         
                          RENAI
          You're an asshole.
                         
                          LORRAINE
          Your wife needs you. Now sit down and
          listen to her. I won't ask you again.
           48.
                         
                         
          Josh obeys. His mothers tone can still shut him up.
                         
                          LORRAINE (CONT'D)
           Go on, Renai. Tell him.
                         
                          RENAI
           This...thing that was in the other
           house. It followed us.
                         
          Josh shifts in his seat. Agitated.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           Let her speak.
                         
                          RENAI
           I saw someone again today. In the
           house. It looked like a young boy.
           I followed it into Dalton's room...
           but it wasn't a child.
                          (BEAT)
           This thing is here. I know it.
                         
                          JOSH
           So...what? You called in a priest
           to get rid of it?
                         
                          RENAI
           I didn't know what else to do.
                         
                          JOSH
           Are you kidding me?
                          (TO LORRAINE)
           Was this your idea?
                         
                          RENAI
           No. It was mine.
                         
                          JOSH
           You've never been to a church in
           your life. Now you're inviting a
           priest into our home? I feel like I
           don't even know you right now.
                         
                          RENAI
           I'm scared.
                         
                          JOSH
           This is a fantasy, and you need a
           therapist, not a member of the
           clergy.
                         
                          RENAI

           I told you...

           What's happening to Renai is real.
           I've seen it for myself.
                          (BEAT)
           I came here today because last night
           I had a dream about this place.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          We are FLOATING through the corridor, looking through
          Lorraine's POV.
                         
          We are inside her dream.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.)
           I was in this house...but it was
           late at night.
                         
          The POV keeps moving, out of the kitchen and into the hall.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I tried to be quiet. I didn't want
           to wake anybody. I was afraid.
                         
          The POV floats down the hall, reaching a door. The door
          opens, revealing Josh and Renai, sleeping.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I looked into your bedroom. You
           were both asleep.
                         
          The POV keeps moving down the hall.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I knew that I was asleep in the
           dream...but I could feel that
           someone was awake in the house.
                         
          We keep pushing on, reaching the door to Dalton's room.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           I went into Dalton's room.
                         
          The door pushes open. In the dark, we can see Dalton, in bed.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           There was someone in there with him.
                         
          The POV turns to see a DARK FIGURE, standing in the corner.
                         
           LORRAINE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           A man was standing in the corner of
           the room.

           I asked him who he was...he said he
           was a visitor. I asked him what he
           wanted...he said Dalton.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Lorraine is clearly unsettled by the dream.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           I can still hear that voice.
                         
          She looks up at Josh - and SCREAMS!
                         
          Over Josh's shoulder, crouched down behind the couch and
          peeking up over the armrest at Lorraine, is a DIABOLICAL
          FIGURE. His face is PURE RED with smeared lipstick. His scalp
          is completely bald, yet tufts of hair dangle above his ears.
          Other than his face, his skin is charcoal black.
                         
          Lorraine recoils back, utterly petrified.
                         
                          JOSH
           What is it?
                         
          Lorraine stares eerily into his eyes. Frozen.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           He's here.
                         
          Renai looks to Josh, who is at a total loss. She is crying.
                         
                          RENAI
           Help us...
                         
          His anger fades and he steps over and takes her in his arms.
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't know how.

          A battered van is parked in the driveway of the house.

          Renai and Josh stand in front of two men. They are silent.

          The shorter one is a wiry young man who looks like he spends
          most of his time in dark rooms. Not a member of the beach
          volleyball team. This is SPECS (32).
                         
          The other is TUCKER (33), a larger man with scruffy facial
          hair. He is eating a Hot Pocket.
                         
                          SPECS
           So you must be Josh?

           Oh.

           I'm Specs.

           I'm here to solve your problem. I'm
           just kidding with the voice. We
           take this very seriously.

           She won't be joining us yet. Usually
           we handle all the background stuff,
           then she gets involved when we have
           the facts.

           Okay...
                         
                          JOSH
           This is a little uncomfortable.
           Speaking for myself. I'm not used
           to this kind of stuff.

           I would like to start by
           interviewing you both. Can we
           record your answers?

                          SPECS
           Right. I heard about this from
           Lorraine. He is in a coma, the
           cause of which is unknown?
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes.

           I take anti-depressants sometimes.

           Not a history. I've had bouts of
           it. In the past.
                         
          Renai is uncomfortable. Specs makes a note. The camera beeps.
                         
                          SPECS
           Tucker, could you check the camera?

           I'm still assisting in the other room.

           Whenever you're ready then.
                         
          A long beat. Tucker finally enters, adjusts the camera.
                         
                          TUCKER
           (to Renai and Josh)
           He handles administration, I handle
           technical. It's an even split. He
           couldn't change a light bulb and I'm
           no good with paperwork. It bores me
           senseless.
                         
          Specs clears his throat, peeved. Continues.

           Nine times out of ten, when someone

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Specs and Tucker mill around the room. Tucker is carrying a
          small electronic device. He holds it against the wall.

                          TUCKER
           Yeah. It's a little more

          Tucker edges into the corridor. He switches out the light,
          then takes what looks like a modified VIEW-MASTER TOY out of
          his shoulder bag, holding it up to his eyes.
                         
          He stalks down the corridor with it. All is quiet.

          He approaches the grandfather clock. Another slide clicks
          into place - showing us TWO FIGURES. Standing beside the
          clock.
                         
          In the negative light, they look like females.
                         
          Tucker lowers the device. There is no one there.

          Josh opens the door to see an elderly woman, ELISE RAINIER
          (73), who despite her years maintains a sprightly energy.

          Elise steps inside. Renai, Tucker and Specs gather around her.
          Everyone becomes very subservient, like the Queen just arrived.

           I'll make myself available.
                         
                          ELISE
           No, that's fine, gentlemen.
                         
          She stares up at the ceiling, as if seeing something they can't.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           I don't think bad wiring is the
           problem here.
                         
          She drifts over to the bookshelf, her hand landing on the stack
          of photo albums Renai looked through in the opening scene.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Hmm.
           57.
                         
                         
          Renai and Josh exchange a look.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           May I walk through the house?
                         
                          RENAI
           Yes. Of course.
                         
                          ELISE
           Steven, do you have your sketchbook?
                         
          Specs hurriedly fishes a sketchbook and pencil out of his bag.
                         
                          SPECS
           Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Yes, yes. I
           do.
                         
                          ELISE
           Good. We're going to need it.
                         
                          RENAI
           What is it for?
                         
                          SPECS
           She tells me what she sees and I
           draw it. It's the most important
           part of her process.
                         
                          TUCKER
           His drawings and my photos comprise
           her visual records.
                         
                          SPECS
           Especially the drawings.
                         
                          TUCKER
           That's debatable.
                         
                          SPECS
           It's not debatable.
                         
                          TUCKER
           It is, but whatever.
                         
                          SPECS
           Onwards and upwards. Find me a ghost.
                         
          Elise begins walking through the house. Tucker and Specs
          trail her and we FOLLOW THEM into the--
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --hallway.
           58.
                         
                         
          Renai and Josh stay back, sheepish. Elise stalks forward at
          the front, surveying every nook and cranny of the house.
                         
          Elise stops suddenly. She is staring straight at a corner of
          the hallway, next to the grandfather clock.
                         
                          RENAI
           What is it?
                         
                          ELISE
           There is something here.
                         
                          TUCKER
           This is where I saw it.
                         
          Elise calmly mutters something to Specs in a low voice, but
          we have trouble hearing it - only snatches of key words.
                         
                          ELISE
           ...long hair...grey dress...her
           eyes are...
                         
          He immediately starts sketching. His line drawings are fast
          but detailed. Impressive.
                         
          He outlines the wall, the ceiling lamp, the grandfather
          clock.
                         
          And then something else...
                         
          Two young women. Standing next to the grandfather clock,
          dressed in Amish garb. Even in the roughness of the drawing,
          we can make out their pleading eyes and pale skin.
                         
          Tucker takes out a camera, snaps some shots. Josh and Renai
          step forward, seeing the sketch.
                         
          Elise keeps moving, heading straight for one door in
          particular. She stops, running her hand over the wood.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Do I have permission to enter this
           room?
                         
                          JOSH
           Go ahead.
                         
                          ELISE
           Maybe you could wait back there?
                         
          Josh and Renai hug each other. Tucker lowers the camera.
                         
          Elise grips the door handle and turns it.
           59.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM - DAY
                         
          The door groans open.
                         
          Dalton is lying on his gurney, surrounded by the sluggish
          drone of hospital equipment. The curtains are drawn and the
          room is dark.
                         
          Elise hesitates...then steps inside.
                         
                          ELISE
           Leave the lights off.
                         
          Elise steps closer to Dalton. She runs her hands over his
          prone body. She shivers as she does.
                         
          A ripple of fear passes through her. Her breath quickens.
                         
          Slowly...very very slowly ...she gazes up at a corner of
          the ceiling. Her eyes WIDEN and the look on her face
                         SHOULD
                         BE
                         ABSOLUTE
          T E R R O R.
                         
          Her arm raises up, her finger extending and pointing at the
          corner she is glaring at.
                         
                          RENAI
           What is it? What do you see?
                         
          Elise cups her hand over her mouth and whispers to Specs,
          keeping her eyes GLUED to the far corner of the ceiling. We
          cannot hear what she is whispering.
                         
          Hand shaking, Specs feverishly starts to sketch. We cannot
          see what he is drawing.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           What do you see?!
                         
          The strokes of Specs' pencil become faster and rougher,
          keeping up with Elise's whispers. Sweat dots his forehead.
                         
          Tucker glances at the drawing and steps back instinctively.
          He holds up his Viewmaster.
                         
          POV THROUGH VIEWMASTER - we see the far corner of the ceiling
          change color as Tucker rotates the lenses inside...but
          nothing out of the ordinary appears. Just a ceiling.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Tell me!
           60.
                         
                         
          Suddenly, Renai charges forward, snatching the sketch book.
                         
          The drawing is of a hideous form - crouched in the corner of
          the ceiling, staring down at Dalton below. It is the RED-
          FACED DEMON Lorraine saw earlier.
                         
          His naked body is charcoal black...whilst also strangely
          translucent, the veins visible underneath the flesh. A
          corpulent stomach juts out, as if he were pregnant.
                         
          Terrified, Renai flicks on the light --
                         
          -- revealing nothing but an ordinary ceiling.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Elise holds court in the living room.
                         
          Renai and Josh hold each other, struggling to comprehend it all.
                         
                          ELISE
           I'm not sure if you are ready to
           hear this yet...but unfortunately I
           can't waste any time easing you
           into it. There is no time left.
                         
          She takes a deep breath, preparing herself.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           I want you to know that this is
           what I believe and it may
           contradict a previous medical
           diagnosis. However, you called me
           here and I am taking that as an
           acceptance of my readings.
                         
                          RENAI
           Go on.
                         
                          ELISE
           Your son...is not in a coma. His
           physical body is here, but his
           spiritual body is not.
                          (BEAT)
           The reason these disturbances
           followed you to a new home is
           because...it is not the house that
           is haunted. It is your son.
                         
          This is too much for Josh. Renai, however, wants to listen.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't understand...
           61.
                         
                         
          Elise considers what she is about to say carefully.
                         
                          ELISE
           Have you ever heard of astral
           projection?
                         
                          RENAI
           Out of body experiences?
                         
          Elise nods.
                         
                          ELISE
           I call them travellers. These are
           people with the ability to leave
           their physical body and travel to
           different places in an astral form.
           To some degree, we all have the
           ability to do it...but most of us
           subconsciously suppress it or don't
           know how to access it.
                         
          Josh shakes his head, agitated. Renai leans forward,
          desperate for an answer to her terror.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Dalton is...a very accomplished
           astral projector. He has been since
           he was very young. He's not afraid
           of his ability. And that lack of
           fear has led him to travel too far
           and become lost...
                         
                          RENAI
           Lost? Lost where?
                         
          Elise gazes up at the ceiling, as if looking into another world.
                         
                          ELISE
           In The Further.
                         
                          RENAI
           What do you mean?
                         
                          ELISE
           The Further is that place beyond our
           perception, beyond our understanding
           of the physical world that we can see
           and touch. It is a place without
           clocks or measurements, without past
           or future...an infinite realm that
           holds all of our dreams...and all of
           our nightmares.
                         
          She turns to look at them.
           62.
                         
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           That is where Dalton is.
                         
          Renai cries, unprepared for what she is hearing.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           The problem is that with his astral
           body gone, he has left a physical
           body with us. An empty vessel.
                         
          Josh can't meet her gaze.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           And there are entities that know
           this. They can smell it - the
           chance to live again. That is why
           they have gathered around him.
                         
                          RENAI
           How many are there?
                         
                          ELISE
           There are five benevolent spirits.
           Five different entities for whom
           Dalton has become a most prized
           possession. They are trying to get
           inside his physical body...and they
           get closer with each passing day.
                         
          Her words hang in the air like gunsmoke. Pure fear courses
          through Josh's eyes. He fidgets, agitated.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Then there are two entities who
           are...not benevolent. One of them
           takes the form of a man, the
           other...
                         
          She holds up the drawing that Specs di.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           They work together, so desperate
           are they to possess Dalton. They
           are the closest of all the entities
           to getting inside him.
                          (BEAT)
           I don't want to scare you, but I
           have never, in all my years of
           doing this, experienced anything as
           terrifying as their presence.
                         
                          RENAI
           Is there a way to bring Dalton back?

                          ELISE
           There is something we could try. A
           way of calling him back. I would
           need your complete trust.
                         
          Josh can't take it any more. He stands up.
                         
                          JOSH
           No. No. This has gone too far.
                         
                          RENAI
           You said that you'd give her a chance!
                         
                          JOSH
           I have given her a chance, and I
           did that because I wanted to help
           you. But I cannot have somebody
           telling us that the reason our son
           is in a coma is because his soul is
           floating off somewhere in another
           dimension.
                         
                          ELISE
           I know this is hard to hear.
                         
                          JOSH
           No, it's not fair is what it is.
           You're preying on people's grief and
           vulnerability, which is really easy
           to do in a situation like this.
                         
                          RENAI
           Why did we go to all the trouble of
           bringing them here if you're just
           going to reject what they say?
                         
                          JOSH
           Because I wanted to help you. To
           put your mind at ease, and if this
           helped, then great. But to drag
           Dalton into this? No.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh, you're not being fair...
                         
                          JOSH
           Fair? How did the voice of reason
           become the bad guy here? Don't you
           see? You want to believe. Of course
           you do, honey, anybody would.
                         
          The room goes quiet. Josh turns to Elise.
           64.
                         
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Look, I appreciate what you're
           trying to do. I really do. But I
           think it's dangerous to start
           throwing out false hope like this.
           I have to put my foot down. My wife
           is not...mentally well at the
           moment, and I have to keep at least
           one of her feet here in the real
           world.
                         
                          RENAI
           You never believed me...
                         
                          JOSH
           Honey, I'm on your side. But I
           genuinely think this is dangerous
           and frankly, a little exploitative.
                         
          He turns to Elise, Specs and Tucker.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You come into a home with a
           seriously ill child, you make a
           tenuous connection between him and
           these experiences Renai is having
           and viola - the client starts
           crying because they're desperate to
           believe, the tears validate your
           power, thank you, that'll be six
           hundred dollars please.
                         
                          SPECS
           We reject more cases than we take.
           We're not out for money, sir.
                         
                          JOSH
           I know, I know...look, I appreciate
           your interest and your time. I do.
           Thank you. Thank you very much.
                         
          He goes to the front door, opening it.
                         
                          ELISE
           I completely understand. And I
           honestly don't blame you for
           reacting like this.
                         
          She walks to the door, followed by Specs and Tucker, who
          sling their bags over their shoulders sheepishly.
                         
                          RENAI
           No, please...don't go.
           65.
                         
                         
                          ELISE
           Thank you for your time.
                         
          They exit. The door closes. They are gone.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Renai lies in bed, awake...a broken shell of her former self.
          A bottle of anti-depressants sits on the bedside table.
                         
          Josh enters the bedroom. Sits down beside her.
                         
                          JOSH
           Look at me for a second, honey.
                          (BEAT)
           Look at me.
                         
          She doesn't look up.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Did you really believe what she
           said? In your heart of hearts, did
           you actually take what she was
           saying literally?
                         
          A long beat of silence passes.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't know...
                         
                          JOSH
           Do you think I don't want to
           believe in that stuff? Of course I
           do. It would make life a lot easier
           if I did. If I believed that some
           supernatural force was responsible
           for what's happened to our son...
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't believe anything anymore,
           Josh. I used to. I used to believe
           that I could keep my children safe.
           I used to believe everything would
           be okay. To believe in something,
           you have to know it to be true.
                         
          She turns and looks at him.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           The things that have happened to me
           haven't confirmed any beliefs -
           they've done the opposite. They've
           made me question what I believe.
                          (MORE)
           66.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           They've made me realize that maybe
           we don't know as much as we think
           we do.
                         
          Josh paces, at his wits end.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           You ask me if I believe what she
           said to be true and the answer is I
           don't know. But let me ask you this
           - in your heart of hearts, can you
           say for certain that it isn't?
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Josh lies beside Renai, who is sleeping. He is wide awake,
          staring at the ceiling.
                         
          He gets out of bed.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The door opens.
                         
          All is mute as Josh enters, skulking carefully through the
          darkness.
                         
          The curtains lull in the slightest of breezes.
                         
          Josh stands over Dalton.
                         
          He stares down at his sons body, then lets his gaze drift
          around the room...past the CLOSET, past the DRAWINGS pinned
          to the wall and the TOYBOX...all the way to the CORNER of the
          ceiling that Elise was so frightened of. Josh's eyes drill
          into the shadows.
                         
          Is there something waiting there?
                         
          Finally, Josh sits down beside Dalton. He grips his sons hand.
                         
                          JOSH
           Where are you? Where did you go?
                          (BEAT)
           Can you hear me? I'm begging you to
           show me that you can hear me...I
           don't know how to help you. Please
           tell me what to do.
                         
          Josh's torment fills the air...but Dalton doesn't move.
           67.
                         
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Please God, please help me...give
           me my son back. I will do anything
           just to have him back.
                         
          Josh studies Dalton's face for a response. Nothing. Not a
          twitch. He collapses forward onto Dalton. Holding him tight.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I need him back. I need him to show
           me that he can hear me. Please...
                         
          For a moment, all we can hear is Josh's breathing.
                         
          Then...something happens. Something Josh doesn't see.
                         
          Dalton's face twitches. It is a very slight movement. This
          movement is followed by something that is hard to miss--
                         
          One of the tacks pinning one of Dalton's drawings to the wall
          begins to wind loose.
                         
          It pops free, shooting across the room like a kernel of
          popcorn...followed by another tack.
                         
          The second tack lands in Josh's lap. Puzzled, he picks it up,
          examining it. He looks up, his eye drawn to the picture on
          the wall.
                         
          With total astonishment, he sees the two remaining tacks
          works themselves free, popping out of the wall.
                         
          The drawing floats down to the ground.
                         
          Josh stoops down, picking it up.
                         
          It is a drawing split into two halves. The left half is a
          self portrait of Dalton, lying in bed, looking down from
          above.
                         
          The right half is a depiction of outer space - squiggly stars
          and bloated planets.
                         
          Dalton has drawn another version of himself on this side,
          flying above the house with another man.
                         
          At the bottom of the first drawing, Dalton has written `Last
          night I watched myself sleep'.
                         
          A tear falls down Josh's face. He begins to cry. Deep and
          painful tears he has long pent up.
                         
          Beneath the second drawing, Dalton has written `Then I flew away.'
           68.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
                         
          Renai's eyes flutter open. She glances over. No one is there.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
                         
          Renai shuffles into the kitchen.
                         
          Josh is sitting at the kitchen table, staring at Dalton's
          drawing. He hasn't slept and looks it. He looks up at her.
                         
                          JOSH
           Okay.
                         
          Renai approaches Josh and they hug...holding on for dear life.
                         
                         
          EXT. NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The Lambert house is lit from within. Like a Jack-O-Lantern.
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Action stations.
                         
          Tucker sets up two stills camera's around Dalton's room,
          zipping back and forth between the two tripods. Specs opens
          up a kit, taking out his notepad and a pencil.
                         
          A small, circular table has been set up, adjacent to Dalton's
          bed. Elise sits at the table, flanked on either side by Josh
          and Renai.
                         
                          ELISE
           What's most important is that you
           realize no two attempts are the
           same. I will be completely honest
           with you about the results, and if
           no dialogue is established, I will
           tell you. I am not in the business
           of embellishing success. What
           happens, happens.
                         
          Josh and Renai nod grimly, truly out of their depth.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Forget the limits and laws and logic
           of this world. We are treading in a
           different place now.
                         
          Tucker finally sets his cameras and takes a seat in the corner,
          holding up a HAND-HELD VIDEO CAMERA.
           69.
                         
                         
                          TUCKER

           will write it down and repeat it
           for you.
                         
          Specs waits obediently at her side.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Hold on to each other, and stay
           focused. You'll see things you
           don't understand. Confusing things.
           Do not question them or speak in
           any way.
                         
          She turns to Specs.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Dim the lights please.
                         
          Tucker reaches up and dims the lights to a very low level.
                         
          Elise closes her eyes, concentrating. She relaxes her head,
          as if meditating, letting it loll on her shoulders.
                         
          One of the cameras on the tripod goes off, bathing the room
          in white light for a split second.
                         
          Elise inhales and exhales deeply, slipping away. Soon, she is
          very still.
                         
          Specs nods to Tucker silently, then produces an odd looking
          device made from GREY CLOTH.
                         
          It almost resembles a gas mask from World War 1, with a cone
          shaped muzzle that fits over the mouth and nose. The snout of
          the facemask is like an elongated elephant trunk, coiling
          outwards and ending in an old listening device, like an early
          version of a microphone.
                         
          Specs slips two hooks over Elise's ears and gently places the
          device over her nose and mouth. He then takes a seat next to
          her, behind Renai, who holds Elise's hand.
                         
          Specs takes out his notepad and fixes a small apparatus
          around his neck that holds a flashlight in place.
           70.
                         
                         
          He flicks it on, then holds the microphone end of Elise's
          facemask up to his ear, a pencil gripped in the other hand.
                         
          Dead silence descends over the group like a blanket.
                         
          Then, we hear something lilt through the old microphone. It
          is Elise's muttered whispers. Specs begins writing.
                         
          Renai opens her eyes to peek at what he is scribbling in
          cursive.
                         
          we are calling out to you dalton
          Renai grips Josh's hand tightly.
                         
                          SPECS
           We are calling out to you Dalton.

           Tell us that you are safe. Tell us
           where you are.
                         
          For what seems like an eternity, all is quiet and still...
                         
          ...until Elise's eyelids flutter.
                         
          Another unintelligible whisper drifts out of the microphone
          at Specs' ear. He writes.
           who's there?
                          SPECS (CONT'D)
           Who's there?

           have been looking for you.
                         
          Long pause. Specs writes again, more intense this time.

                          SPECS (CONT'D)

          Another long pause. A little too long.
                         
          Why aren't you talking anymore dalton?
                          SPECS (CONT'D)

           Dalton?
                         
          A long beat. Tucker's camera flash goes off again.

                          SPECS (CONT'D)

                          SPECS (CONT'D)

          Elise's head TWITCHES as Specs' writes furiously, trying to
          keep up. His pencil finally SNAPS. He snatches up another.
                         
           dalton are you there? dalton?
          An agonizing ocean of silence...then this furious scrawl:
                         
          listen to me you filthy whore he isnt here
          you should not have come here you fucking

          fucking innards that spill forth from it i
                         HAVESEENYOUIKNOWWHOYOUAREBUTYOUANDTHE
          Specs writing begins to SHRED the paper as he writes
          furiously, the scrawl getting out of control. Sweat flies
          from his forehead as he struggles to get it all down.
                         
          Suddenly a PIERCING SCREAM blasts through the microphone and
          he jerks it away from his ear - then looks over at Elise.
                         
          With UTTER DREAD, he sees that she is NO LONGER WEARING THE
          MASK. She has taken it off and is panting heavily.
                         
          The scream continues through the mic, audible to
          everyone...then peters out.
                         
          Shocked silence follows.
                         
          Josh glances over at Dalton's bed.
                         
          He is not in it.
           73.
                         
                         
          Stunned, Josh turns back to the table--
                         
          --TO SEE DALTON SITTING NEXT TO HIM. STARING AT HIM.
                         
          His heart leaps out of his skin and so does Renai's as they
          both turn towards Dalton. Their son.
                         
          Dalton stares at them...not a trace of emotion on his face.
                         
          Then he reaches up and grips his bottom jaw with both hands,
          wrenching it downwards with almighty force and BREAKING HIS
          OWN JAW.
                         
          Renai SCREAMS into the abyss as Dalton BELLOWS at them, spit
          flying from his throat, his tongue hanging down over his
          dislocated jaw.
                         
          He stamps his foot and the table - and everyone sitting at
          it, Renai, Josh and Elise - go flying backwards as if pushed
          by a hurricane, smashing into the wall with crushing power.
                         
          We realize that Dalton was not sitting at the table, but
          squatting down awkwardly. Painfully.
                         
          He stands up, then steps forward. As Josh and Renai watch,
          his KNEE begins to BEND BACKWARDS, the tendons stretching and
          snapping, the knee bending in the opposite direction.
                         
          His other knee follows and he steps forward - both knees
          bending back.
                         
          Specs is rigid in his chair, rooted to the spot, notepad
          still in hand. When he looks up at Dalton, the flashlight
          under his chin shines in Dalton's eyes.
                         
          Dalton ROARS and advances forward - SLAPPING Specs with the
          force of ten men. Specs reels backwards, hitting the wall,
          smashing his head and crumpling like paper.
                         
          Elise stands to face Dalton. The CAMERA FLASH goes off again,
          lighting the darkened room for a split second and showing
          Elise the lipstick-smeared face of a demon instead of
          Dalton's face.
                         
          Tucker SHRINKS BACK as he captures all this with the video camera.
                         
          Dalton steps forward again and Elise CHARGES at him, grabbing
          Dalton by the hair.
                         
                          ELISE
           Leave this vessel! Leave this vessel!
                         
          Dalton BELLOWS again - a howl so course and ungodly that it
          seems ripped straight from the bowels of Lucifer himself.
           74.
                         
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           LEAVE THIS VESSEL!
                         
          Dalton FLIES backwards, hitting the corner of the wall and
          then CLIMBING IT, arcing his body into the far corner of the
          ceiling like an expert contortionist.
                         
          He hisses at them as the CAMERA FLASH fires AGAIN AND AGAIN,
          showing them split second frames of the red faced CREATURE.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Leave this earthly body!
                         
          Dalton shrieks again and somehow the force of the cry knocks
          Elise down.
                         
          The room begins to shake.
                         
          Books fly.
                         
          The closet doors burst open.
                         
          With terror, Elise looks over and sees several figures
          peering out from within the closet.
                         
          Two are the women that Specs' drew. Another is a small man,
          dressed like a child.
                         
          They stare out at Elise, their eyes glinting in the dark.
                         
          Elise turns to see Josh. The camera flash STROBES repeatedly
          and gives us split-second glimpses of an OLD WOMAN, dressed
          in Victorian era garb - standing directly behind Josh.
                         
          And then, with absolute fear, Renai sees the LONG HAIRED MAN
          standing over her. He SCREAMS at her and pushes her against
          the wall, licking her. She cries out, terrified.
                         
          With the spirit world, crashing in around her, Elise pulls
          herself off the floor and yells again.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Leave his body!
                         
          Dalton suddenly SPASMS, dropping out of the corner and
          hitting the floor like a rag doll dropped off a bridge.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           The lights!
                         
          Terrified, Specs' scrambles over to the corner, flicking the
          light switch. The room is instantly flooded with light.
                         
          The room has stopped shaking. The screaming has stopped.
           75.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           Dalton!
                         
          Renai wrenches herself across the carpet and reaches Dalton's
          limp body.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Dalton! Dalton!
                         
          She listens for breathing. His chest moves. He is still
          breathing. She holds him and cries. More desperate than ever.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Tucker, Specs and Elise convene in the kitchen, slumped
          amongst the boxes for the tech gear. All are in shock.
                         
                          SPECS
           I feel like a mountain climber
           who's been waiting his whole life
           to climb Everest, and now that I'm
           standing on the summit, I don't
           know what to do with myself...

           I'll tell you what we do with
           ourselves. We make a short list of
           our preferred media outlets, that's
           what.
                         
          He holds up his video camera.
                         
                          TUCKER (CONT'D)
           Watch this.
                         
          He hits play on a monitor that his video camera is cabled to.
          Chaotic images of Dalton from the previous scene SPIT to life.
                         
          BEHIND DALTON, we can just make out the blurry image of the
          RED-FACED DEMON. Puppeteering Dalton from behind. Controlling
          his limbs like a human marionette.
                         
                          SPECS
           Oh my God...
                         
                          TUCKER
           After all the years we've been
           dining out on morsels like a faucet
           that turns itself on and off...we
           finally have some empirical
           evidence of the real thing. Proof.
                         
          He hits pause on the video, freeze-framing the hellish image.
           76.
                         
                         
                          ELISE

           That is so not the point. This is not
           about religion. Here we have
           irrefutable evidence of a paranormal

           No, our job is not to alert the press
           and prove the existence of the
           `paranormal', as you call it. I'm not
           out to prove anything. I've known
           there was a higher plane ever since I
           was a little girl and I could play
           hopscotch with people whose names
           were inscribed on tombstones. What
           you call paranormal is a fact of life
           for me.

           something that would crush most

          Josh sits with Renai's head in his lap. She is too
          traumatized to speak. Rain dribbles down the window pane.
                         
          Josh gets up when he hears the knock at the door. Elise
          shuffles over to answer it.
                         
          She opens the door to reveal Lorraine, wet from the downpour.
                         
          Elise steps aside and Lorraine walks in, gravely sedate.
                         
                          JOSH
           Mom...what are you doing here?
                         
                          ELISE
           I asked your mother to come over. I
           called her immediately after...the
           session. I told her to hurry over.
                         
                          JOSH
           Why?
                         
          Lorraine's usual strong will has evaporated. She looks to Elise.
                         
                          ELISE
           There is something we must talk
           about. Sit down, Lorraine.
                         
          Lorraine follows orders, easing onto the sofa. Eyes down.
                         
          Thunder growls in the distance.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Go on. Tell him.
                         
                          JOSH
           Tell me what?
                         
          Lorraine swallows and starts talking.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           The reason...I knew to call Elise
           in this situation...the reason I
           know her so well...is because I
           called her myself once. Years ago.
                         
          She looks up at Josh.
                         
                          LORRAINE (CONT'D)
           To help you, Josh.
                         
                          JOSH
           What are you talking about?

          Lorraine can't go on. Elise steps in.
                         
                          ELISE
           It's no accident that your son is
           such a gifted traveller. The
           ability was handed down to him.

          We have returned to the opening scene.
                         
          We are looking down on a sleeping child. Chest rising and
          falling with each breath.
                         
          This is JOSH as a child.
                         
          We move away from him, exploring the dark room.

          Tucker and Specs enter the room, lingering at the back.
                         
                          JOSH
           No...I've never...done that before.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           When you were about eight...you
           suffered night terrors. Awful fits
           of pure fear. You were terrified of
           an old woman who you said would
           come to visit you at night.

          Again we return to the opening scene...floating down a long
          hallway.
                         
          A window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach.
                         
          Someone is standing in front of it.
           79.
                         
                         
          The murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away. We
          follow it, tentative. Turning a corner, we see the figure.
          Standing in a doorway.
                         
          Now we can make out the edges of the figure. It is an old
          woman. Hair in a Victorian bun. A corseted dress.
                         
          IT IS THE SAME OLD WOMAN THAT ELISE SAW.
                         
                          OLD WOMAN
           Let me in.

          Lorraine closes her eyes, struggling to go on.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           I dismissed your stories. Told you
           to grow up.
                          (BEAT)
           Then I saw her for myself.
                         
          She looks to Elise, who nods.
                         
          Hand trembling, Lorraine retrieves a packet from within her
          coat. The paper is yellowing. Faded. Soaked from the rain.
                         
          Lorraine hands the packet to Josh, who is dumbfounded.
                         
          Renai peers over Josh's shoulder, at a Polaroid of a boy,
          about nine years old, sitting on a couch. Early 70s period.
                         
          It is a Young Josh. Behind him is the BLURRED OUTLINE OF A
          FIGURE.
                         
          Josh runs his finger over the shadow. His heart rate speeds
          up. An old memory is coming back to him.
                         
                          LORRAINE (CONT'D)
           At first, I thought it was a camera
           problem. Then I saw her again.
                         
          Josh flips to the next photo - it is another faded frame of
          Josh as a youngster. This time he stands in an old kitchen.
                         
          Once again, there is a figure behind him - clearer this time,
          but still hidden in silhouette. A step closer to Josh.
                         
          Josh flips to the next picture. A BLACK AND WHITE shot of
          himself as a young boy, lying in bed.
           80.
                         
                         
          With dread, Josh sees the unmistakable features of an OLD
          WOMAN, crouching beside his bed. Staring at him.
                         
                          LORRAINE (CONT'D)
           In each photo, she got closer and
           closer to you...
                         
          Josh flips to the next picture - in this one, Young Josh is
          standing by a car.
                         
          Behind him, the details of the Old Woman's dress are visible.
          Her arm is extended...reaching out for Josh's neck.
                         
          Renai's hand flies to her mouth.

           Finally, I was so scared, I called
           Elise.
                         
          Sweat pours down Josh's brow.
                         
          He lets the photographs flutter from his fingers, backing
          away. Fragments of memories rock his entire body.
                         
                          JOSH
           I don't...I don't remember any of
           this...

          Josh grabs the wall, weak at the knees.
                         
                          LORRAINE
           I've kept the photos hidden ever

                          ELISE
           I advised Lorraine to hide them. To
           stop taking your picture. And to
           let you forget.
                         
                          JOSH
           Who is she?
                         
                          ELISE
           A parasite. She befriended your

          Elise sits opposite him.
                         
          Tucker and Specs set up around her, fixing their cameras in
          place. Renai leans forward on the couch opposite, chewing her

          arm so it moves back and forth.
                         
          TICK...TICK...TICK.
                         
                          ELISE
           Close your eyes, Josh...and relax.
           Breathe deeply. Let all life around you
           fade out into the background...until
           the only thing you can hear is the
           ticking of the metronome.
                         
          We PUSH IN on Josh, inhaling and exhaling. TICK...TICK...TICK.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Focus on a spot in the center of
           your forehead. Feel that spot
           getting further away as you drift
           off to sleep.
                         
          We are now in an ECU of Josh. TICK...TICK...TICK.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           I want you to relax your physical
           body and let the astral body gain
           strength...feel it rising out of
           your chest.
                         
          Renai watches, literally and figuratively on the edge of her
          seat. Tucker and Specs take notes from the corner.
                         
          Josh breathes deeply. Eyes shut tightly.
                         
                          ELISE (CONT'D)
           Detach yourself.
                         
          Josh's eyes open suddenly and he stands up, frustrated,
          marching across the living room.
           83.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           This is useless...I have no idea
           what I'm doing and you just
           suddenly expect me to...
                         
          He turns around and stops dead. His words trail off.
                         
          HE IS LOOKING AT HIMSELF.
                         
          He sees his own body, sitting in the armchair, eyes closed.
          Elise is sitting opposite, with her back to the Josh who is
          now standing.
                         
          The living room is exactly as it was - only Renai, Lorraine,
          Tucker and Specs have disappeared. They are nowhere to be
          seen.
                         
          Stunned into mute shock, Josh stares at his own body in the
          armchair.
                         
          Slowly, Elise turns her head away from the Josh in the chair,
          staring eerily into the standing Josh's eyes.
                         
          She can see him.
                         
                          ELISE
                          (SOFTLY)
           Now you are free.
                          (BEAT)
           Keep your guide, and a steady
           stride...and into The Further you
           go.
                         
          She turns back to the Josh in the chair. The room seems to
          have darkened even more somehow.
                         
          Josh turns and glares into the darkness of his hallway as it
          yawns outwards, eventually swallowed by complete blackness.
                         
          He is not in another world. He is in his own house.
                         
          NOTE - The following scenes are not going to be "movie
          quiet". They will be inhumanly quiet. There will no score.
          Only sound scape. This is another world and should feel so.
                         
          Josh moves forward, gliding down the hall slowly. He looks
          down and sees that his feet are slighty raised off the
          ground.
                         
          He is floating.
                         
          He moves into the darkness of the hall...past the bedroom
          doors and closet doors.
           84.
                         
                         
          As he floats past, he scans every darkened corner for the
          slightest trace of movement.
                         
          He reaches the front door. He moves towards it and as he does
          it OPENS.
                         
                         
          EXT. THE FURTHER - NOT NIGHT OR DAY, BUT DARK
                         
          His street beckons beyond the door.
                         
          Josh floats across his lawn.
                         
          There are no people or cars on the street...it is as desolate
          as a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
                         A
                         TOTAL
                         ABSENCE
                         OF
          LIFE.
                         
          Some lights flicker from within the houses, but no movement
          or signs of human forms. Only mist.
                         
          Josh floats an inch above the road, moving down the street.
                         
          One thing to notice is that there is a total lack of horizon
          or city scape here...Josh's immediate surroundings are
          visible for about one hundred yards or so...anything beyond
          that, in any direction, fades into blackness. As if someone
          were shining a giant spotlight down on him.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Renai watches Josh. He is completely still...in a trance.
                         
          His eyelids flutter as his eyeballs probe in all directions
          underneath.
                         
                          ELISE
           He's in...
                         
                         
          EXT. THE FURTHER - NIGHT
                         
          Josh keeps moving, his fear registering, even in this world.
                         
          He looks down at his feet.
                         
          He is frustrated that he can't move any faster. He
          concentrates with fierce intensity--
                         
          --and then watches as his feet touch the ground.
           85.
                         
                         
          He is walking.
                         
          He starts to move faster, gaining control of his movement.
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton?
                         
          The sound of his voice is strangely dead - as if he were
          inside a soundproof recording studio. There are no walls or
          angles for it to bounce off.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton? Where are you?
                         
          For a long time, there is nothing...
                         
          ...
                         
          ...then he sees it.
                         
          A figure...shrouded in shadow. Standing on the street corner
          with his back to Josh.
                         
          Josh moves towards the figure.
                         
          Closer. Closer.
                         
          The man abruptly turns the corner without looking back.
                         
          Josh glances around the corner. There is nobody there.
                         
          He continues down the street. He sees a little girl. Far in
          the distance, but close enough to focus on. She stands and
          stares...
                         
          ...then turns and walks away. Gone...like an apparition.
                         
          He looks to his right and sees--
                         
          --A SHADOW.
                         
          Behind a curtain in one of the windows, back lit by candle
          light. As with the others, the shadow turns away and
          disappears.
                         
          Josh walks towards the front door of the house. He reaches it
          and turns the handle.
                         
                         
          INT. HOUSE - THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A long corridor beckons. As with all of this world, it is
          dark here.
           86.
                         
                         
          Josh walks into the corridor, looking to his left and right
          into empty rooms. Living rooms and bedrooms. Devoid of life.
                         
          The colors are muted...the palate drained. Only REDS and
          BLACKS pop out. Blood and darkness.
                         
          Josh keeps moving down the corridor.
                         
          Up ahead, he sees a figure run past the top of the hall,
          ignoring Josh.
                         
          He presses forward, following the figure.
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton?
                         
          He glances into an empty kitchen. Food rots on the table.
                         
          His footsteps have no sound as he continues on.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton?
                         
          He passes a door that is partly open. He pushes it wide open.
                         
                         
          INT. SMALL ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The room is small and empty. A strange room...like a stage.
                         
          A figure is sitting in the corner, facing the wall like a
          child being punished at school.
                         
          Josh steps closer, cautious. Takes another step.
                         
                          JOSH
           Where is Dalton?
                         
          He steps closer yet again.
                         
          His hand reaches out to touch the figures back...
                         
          ...his fingers are almost grazing the figures shoulder.
                         
          Soft laughter behind him. Josh glances back to look for the
          source.
                         
          When he turns back, the FIGURE IS GONE.
                         
          He wheels around, seeing the small-statured figure of the
          DWARF that Renai encountered, stepping through the door of
          the room.
           87.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh sidles back into the corridor. His pace is sluggish,
          dream-like.
                         
          Frustrated, he stops. Then turns to his left.
                         
          SOMEONE IS RIGHT THERE IN HIS FACE. A MAN.
                         
          The man is not looking at him...only standing very close. His
          neck lolls on his shoulders...around and around. He seems
          stuck on a loop. He is dressed in a fifties era suit.
                         
                          JOSH
           Do you know where Dalton is?
                         
          The man doesn't acknowledge him.
                         
                          MAN
           Why do I have to put up with you?
           What a tramp. You call this a home?
           I work all day for this?
                         
          He marches away, leaving Josh standing alone.
                         
          Josh keeps going, whirling around. He reaches a set of stairs.
          The stairs descend into darkness.
                         
          Josh squints into the dark, afraid.
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton? Where are you?
                         
          The low rumble of this place is the only reply. Josh turns to
          walk away. A distant voice stops him.
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
           Dad...
                         
          Josh SNAPS back.
                         
          The voice drifted from out of the darkness at the bottom of
          the stairs.
                         
          Josh scurries down the creaky ramp towards it.
                         
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The core of a rotten apple. The bowels of hell.
                         
          Drenched in shadow, Josh fumbles forward into yet another
          corridor of this labyrinth.
           88.
                         
                         
          He realizes he knows where he is. He is in his OLD HOUSE. An
          alternate world version of it.
                         
          The lighting is different - it's darker. There are no signs
          of life. Water drips somewhere.
                         
          Josh stumbles forward, seeing an open door.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh slinks into a darkened and dilapidated living room.
                         
          There are THREE PEOPLE in here - a middle aged woman, a middle
          aged man and a young girl. They are all FROZEN, standing in
          place as if someone had hit the pause button on their life.
                         
          The woman is in the middle of ironing. The man is sitting in an
          arm chair reading a newspaper. The girl is lying on the floor.
                         
          The whole scene looks like a macabre `Leave It To Beaver'
          tableau - a cheerful family frozen in time.
                         
          Josh steps closer to the mother...
                         
          ...hairs prickling up on his neck when he sees her BLINK. Her
          body moves slightly. She is not frozen - merely playing
          statues. Like a street performer keeping as still as possible.
                         
          Josh turns to the father. He is the same. His hand shakes,
          struggling to hold the newspaper in place.
                         
          He backs away from them, truly creeped out. His back hits a
          window and he turns, peering through the glass down at the
          street below.
                         
          A figure, hidden in silhouette, is gazing up at him.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Josh stalks into a kitchen off the living room. A weathered
          door is adjacent to the kitchen.
                         
          The door is ajar.
                         
          Through it, Josh can see somebodies leg.
                         
          Josh approaches the door, prodding it open gently with his
          finger.
                         
          It is a bedroom. A tattered cot sits against the wall. A
          YOUNG MAN (17) sits on the cot, holding a rifle. Like the
          others, he is trying to be completely still, as if on pause.
           89.
                         
                         
          He is having more trouble than the family, trembling
          slightly.
                         
                          JOSH
           I'm looking for my son, Dalton.
                         
          The boy does not look up. Does not move.
                         
          Josh retreats, scanning the kitchen. There are soiled pots in
          the sink. Rotting food, but no bugs. Josh turns the faucet
          but no water comes forth.
                         
          When he turns back, the YOUNG MAN is gone. No longer in his
          bedroom.
                         
          Josh glances back at the living room.
                         
          The Young Man is now standing inside the living room.
                         
          Again, he is frozen. Holding his rifle. Looking down at his
          family, who are now splayed out on the carpet, soaked in
          BLOOD.
                         
          Each of them has a bullet hole in their head.
                         
          Repulsed, Josh tip-toes past them. He looks down at the
          mother - a bullet wound in the center of her chest.
                         
          She blinks...still playing dead.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          More corridors disappearing into darkness.
                         
          Josh wrenches his hair in frustration. He boils over,
          screaming at the top of his lungs.
                         
                          JOSH
           DALTON!!!! WHERE ARE YOU?!!!
                         
          His cry recedes into nothingness.
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
           Dad....
                         
          He heard that. Excited, he spins around, trying to determine
          where it came from.
                         
          As he does, he sees that the entire dead family is now
          gathered at the door to the living room. Watching him.
                         
          He summons all his strength and starts running, backing away
          from them.
           90.
                         
                         
          He drives himself to move faster and faster.
                         
                          JOSH
           DALTON!
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
           Dad...help me...
                         
                          JOSH
           DALTON!!
                         
          A figure suddenly appears at the end of the hallway.
                         
          It is the LONG HAIRED MAN IN THE GREY JACKET. The man who
          terrorized Renai.
                         
           LONG HAIRED MAN
           I hear you...
                         
          He approaches.
                         
           LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)
           I hear you, but you don't know what
           you've done.
                         
          He licks his lips.
                         
           LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)
           There is a place that you can't go
           to and this is that place.
                         
          He is only a few yards from Josh now. He SCREAMS with awesome
          power, his spit flying.
                         
           LONG HAIRED MAN (CONT'D)
           YOU MADE A MISTAKE!! I'M GOING TO
           MAKE SUFFERING A FUCKING BLESSING
           FOR YOU! I'M GOING TO RIP YOU APART
           YOU CUNT!!
                         
          He CHARGES at Josh, screaming with hellfire fury.
                         
          Josh recoils, falling onto the floor, screaming.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Josh's body JOLTS in the chair and he makes a noise somewhere
          between a scream and a moan.
                         
                          RENAI
           What's happening to him?!
                         
          Elise leans in, attempting to communicate with Josh.
           91.
                         
                         
                          ELISE
           You're stronger then they are,
           Josh. You are a living soul!
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          Josh struggles. The Long Haired Man attacks him viciously.
                         
          Then something changes in Josh - he gets angry.
                         
                          JOSH
           Get...off..me!
                         
          He shoves the Long Haired Man back, pounding into him with
          the strength of TEN MEN.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Get away from me! Leave now!
                         
          Frightened, the Long Haired Man retreats, backing away until
          he is swallowed up by the blackness.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Dalton!!
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
                          (STILL DISTANT)
           I'm here...
                         
          Josh follows the voice to another stairwell in this Escher-
          like maze of passageways.
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton!
                         
           DALTON (O.S.)
           Here...
                         
                         
          INT. BALLROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          From darkness into baroque extravagance.
                         
          Josh finds himself in a gilded chamber of long neglected
          opulence...as if a palace had been stormed, the occupants
          murdered and the place left to rot.
                         
          Mold caked pillars support a ceiling of gold flakes, the rest
          having rotted way.
                         
          Mirrors line the walls, their surface too clouded to see into.
           92.
                         
                         
                          JOSH
           Dalton...?
                         
          He weaves between pillars, finally coming across a figure,
          slumped on the floor in the corner like a dog.
                         
          It is Dalton.
                         
          Josh runs to him. His foot is chained to a PIPE behind him,
          the clamp binding his right ankle. He looks pale and sick. He
          looks like one of them.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I'm taking you back.
                         
          He sees that Dalton is terrified. Looking over Josh's
          shoulder.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           What is it?
                         
          He glances back, spotting an open door at the end of the
          ballroom, light spilling from within it.
                         
          There is somebody inside.
                         
                         
          INT. MAKE-UP ROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A grotesque form sits in front of an immense gold-rimmed
          mirror at a baroque powder table.
                         
          It is the RED-FACED creature seen by Elise.
                         
          The creature daubs RED LIPSTICK onto its face, arching
          forward, glaring into the mirror, caking the make-up on.
                         
          The room is littered with hundreds of discarded CHILDREN'S
          TOYS - teddy bears, stuffed animals, dolls (including one
          white-faced, black-haired doll we recognize). They are
          scattered about like bones, collecting dust in the shadows.
                         
          Suddenly the creature stops what it is doing. It sees
          something in the mirror.
                         
          What it sees is Josh.
                         
                         
          INT. BALLROOM, THE FURTHER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          With horror, Josh watches as the Red-Faced Man stands up and
          staggers to the door, peering through the crack at him.
                         
          Josh wrestles to free Dalton's leg from the chain. No good.
           93.
                         
                         
          Behind them the Red Faced Man opens the door. A rage unknown
          to humans is building up inside the creature. He hisses.
                         
                          DALTON
           Help me, dad...take this off me...
                         
          The creature steps closer. Taking his time. Drool seeping
          from his mouth with each drunken, wayward lope.
                         
                          JOSH
           You're not really here. You're
           asleep in your bed in our home.
           Just stand up.
                         
                          DALTON
           He's going to hurt me again...
                         
                          JOSH
           This isn't real. You can do this.
                         
                          DALTON
           He's coming!
                         
                          JOSH
           Just stand up!
                         
          Dalton does - and suddenly finds that the chain is no longer
          attached to his foot.
                         
          The Red Faced Man ROARS and the power of his breath sends
          them FLYING BACK.
                         
                          RED-FACED MAN
           This...issssss....real!
                         
          Josh smashes his head on a pillar, blood leaking from his
          head. The power of this demon far outweighs the others.
                         
           RED-FACED MAN (CONT'D)
           That...issss...my....boy!
                         
          Josh scrambles to his feet and snatches up Dalton, carrying
          him to the door as the Red Faced Man pursues.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Josh convulses in the chair, choking.
                         
                          RENAI
           Help him!
           94.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          Josh surges down a corridor, carrying Dalton.
                         
          The Red-Faced Man hobbles up behind them, his rasping wheeze
          growing in volume.
                         
                          RED-FACED MAN
           You're here now! With ussss!
                         
          Josh stampedes through the front door of the house - but
          instead of the street, he is facing another corridor.
                         
          They spill into the second corridor, running again, racing
          past rows and rows of doors.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Josh twitches in his chair, sweat beading on his forehead.
                         
                          JOSH
                          (MOANING)
           ....ome....onnnnn...
                         
          Elise paces in front of him.
                         
                          ELISE
           They've made contact. I know it.
           He's found your son.
                         
                          RENAI
           What happens now?
                         
                          ELISE
           We need them to come back. We need
           him to find us.
                         
          Tucker's equipment begins to shake on the table. The hanging
          light above them quivers as if an earthquake were rattling it.
                         
          A force is building in the room.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          As Josh and Dalton streak down the corridor, each door opens
          and a different figure staggers out.
                         
          Grotesque figures...the solemn dead. Pale skin, hollow eyes.
          Their dead eyes drill into Josh's soul.
                         
          They want what he has - life.
           95.
                         
                         
          They begin running - chasing Josh. Dozens of them.
                         
          Josh stops, seeing that the corridor seemingly has NO END. He
          yells in frustration.
                         
                          JOSH
           I want to get out!
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Josh's body SHUDDERS, the cry escaping his lips.
                         
                          JOSH
           ....eeeeet out!
                         
          The room trembles again. Elise looks to Renai.
                         
                          ELISE
           Call out to him!
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          Josh whips around, desperate.
                         
                          DALTON
           Listen!
                         
          Josh follows the order - and hears it. A faint shout. A siren
          call from another world.
                         
           RENAI (V.O.)
                          (DISTANT)
           Josh, follow my voice...
                         
          The voice seems to come from behind the door in front of
          Josh. He shoves it open--
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - OUR WORLD
                         
          Renai glares at Josh's eyelids...as if he can see her through
          them.
                         
                          RENAI
           Follow my voice. Come back to us.
                         
          The room stops trembling. All is very still.
                         
          For a moment, it is as if time has stopped. Nuclear silence.
          Then...a drawer slides open in the corner of the room.
                         
          Lorraine and Renai gasp at this supernatural interruption.
           96.
                         
                         
          Specs clambers to his feet, approaching the drawer. It
          contains a note pad and nothing else.
                         
          He reaches out to close it...and then JOLTS as a HAND reaches
          out from within it!
                         
          He FLAILS backwards in fright, watching as the hand wrenches
          a mop of hair into view.
                         
          A FULL GROWN BODY BEGINS TO CLAW its way out of the drawer!
                         
                         
          INT. DALTON'S BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          Drawers in Dalton's room slide open in unison. Then cabinets.
          The closet BURSTS open.
                         
          Pale adult bodies begin to claw their way out of the
          different doors, undulating out of impossibly small spaces
          and falling onto the floor like limbless insects.
                         
          Cracks are opening in our world and the miserable dead are
          slithering through the fissures.
                         
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          More doors shoot open - cabinets, closets, the pantry. Forced
          by unseen hands.
                         
          More hideous forms wrench themselves out into our world.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, THE FURTHER
                         
          Josh is exhausted, pushing himself to the limits.
                         
          He hears the voice again - distant and small. An echo.
                         
           RENAI (V.O.)
           Find us...
                         
          Josh follows the voice to a door.
                         
          He staggers towards it, still supporting Dalton. He slams the
          door open, falling through it into--
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT, LAMBERT HOME, THE FURTHER
                         
          -- the empty basement.
                         
          He is in the basement of his old house. The wooden steps
          beckon above him.
           97.
                         
                         
          Renai's voice cries out from behind the door at the top of
          the stairs.
                         
           RENAI (V.O.)
           Hurry! Come back to us!
                         
                          DALTON
           Put me down, I can run!
                         
          Josh sets Dalton down, who scampers up the stairs. Josh is
          about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar face.
                         
          THE OLD WOMAN.
                         
          She leers at Josh through the window of the basement, her
          visage spookily flecked in candlelight.
                         
          Josh is transfixed.
                         
                          DALTON (CONT'D)
           Come on, dad! Come on!
                         
                          JOSH
           Go! I'm right behind you!
                         
          Dalton charges ahead as Josh glares back at this face from
          his past.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You...what do you want from me?
                         
          The old woman's eerily unblinking gaze cuts through Josh. A
          long dormant rage BOILS OVER inside him. He approaches the
          window, vomiting fury at her.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Get the fuck away from me! I'm not
           scared of you, just leave me alone!
           Get away from me!
                         
          The old woman's lips protract to unveil a yellow graveyard of
          molars. A smile to buckle the steeliest nerve.
                         
          She raises a lit candle to her lips.
                         
          She snuffs out the plume with a single puff...plunging the
          basement into darkness.

          cabinets ambulate into the living room, surrounding Josh.

          Specs sprints out of the room.

          We are now locked into a POV shot, pushing down the corridor
          of the Lambert's NEW HOUSE. The scene of the trance.
                         
          Our POV is bee-lining for Dalton's bedroom.

          Our POV is only a few yards from Dalton's bedroom door.
                         
          The Red-Faced Man appears at the opposite end of the hall.
          Malevolent. Cruel.
                         
          He SCREAMS and flits towards us.
                         
          The POV keeps going, hitting the bedroom door and FLINGING IT
          OPEN - seeing DALTON'S BODY sleeping inside.
                         
          We SOAR towards it, getting closer--

          Specs stands over Dalton's body.
                         
          SUDDENLY - Dalton shudders, his legs spasm. His eyes FLICK
          open and he SUCKS IN A HUGE BREATH.
                         
                          SPECS
           He's awake!
                         
          Dalton sits up, panting. Renai charges into the room. He
          looks at her, registering her appearance.

          Renai literally throws herself at him, wrapping her arms
          around his body. No words can express.
                         
          Renai scoops him up, carrying him out of the bedroom.

          Elise leans into Josh's face.
                         
          The living room is now filled with the CREEPING FORMS of the
          souls who crawled out from within the drawers. All of them
          marching towards Josh.

          Josh's eyes BURST OPEN and he inhales a chest full of air, as
          if emerging from deep water.
                         
          He falls forward, his strength gone.
                         
                          RENAI
           Josh? Josh?
                         
          He pants on the floor, barely able to speak.

          Dalton and Renai pounce on him.
                         
          Josh holds onto Dalton like he's a life preserver, and in a
          way, for Josh, he is. He laughs, inhaling deeply.
           100.
                         
                         
          Specs, Elise and Tucker approach. Renai sees them and stands
          up, tearful. She is lost for words.
                         
                          RENAI
           I don't know what to say...
                         
          She rushes forward and hugs all three of them.
                         
                          ELISE
           Well put.
                         
          Josh brings Lorraine in they all embrace in a circle. A group
          hug for the ages.

          It's over.
                         
          Specs and Tucker haul a large tripod case to their van,
          heaving it into the back.
                         
          They stand in awkward silence. It's been a long day.
                         
                          TUCKER

          Tucker can't hold his stoic pose any longer. He breaks out
          laughing, followed quickly by Specs.
                         
                          TUCKER

          They shake hands.

           are gonna be the main selling point.
                         
                          SPECS
           Yeah.
                          (BEAT)
           Not the main selling point, but
           definitely important, for sure.
           101.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Renai lie with Dalton on her bed.
                         
                          DALTON
           I'm tired.
                         
                          RENAI
           Too bad. I'm never letting you go
           to sleep again.
                         
          She runs her fingers through his hair.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Did you know we'd come and find you?
                         
          Dalton nods.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Whenever you're lost...we'll always
           come and find you.
                         
          They hug.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Josh wanders out of the kitchen, examining the house as if
          seeing it for the first time. He is smiling...happier than we
          have ever seen him.
                         
          Elise sits on the couch amongst the remains of Tucker's
          paraphernalia of the paranormal. Josh approaches her,
          standing over her.
                         
                          JOSH
           You introduced me to a new world.
                         
                          ELISE
           No. You've been there before,
           remember? And you'll go back.
                          (BEAT)
           All of us will...eventually.
                         
                          JOSH
           Maybe I can forget again.
                         
          He reaches into his jacket, taking out the eerie photos
          Lorraine gave him of himself as a child.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I'll start by giving these back.
           102.
                         
                         
          As he hands them to Elise, she sees with fear that his hand
          is withered and wrinkled.
                         
          Like the hand of an eighty year old woman.
                         
          Shocked, she looks up at his face.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           What's wrong?
                         
          Elise stands. She looks haunted. Her eyes wide and unnerved.
                         
                          ELISE
           Nothing, I...
                         
          She turns away, reaching for something.
                         
                          JOSH
           What's the matter, Elise?
                         
          She spins around and lifts Tucker's camera up to her face,
          aiming it at him. She depresses the trigger and takes a photo
          of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light.
                         
          Josh recoils back in shock. Elise lowers the camera. She is
          terrified. Josh suddenly LUNGES at her, slapping the camera
          out of her hands.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           Why the fuck would you do that? Why
           would you do that? Why?!
                         
          He SLAMS her against the wall, his hands around her throat.
                         
          Elise chokes in terror, terrified of him.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You of all people! You know! Why
           would you do that to me when you
           know what you know? You bitch!
                         
          He abruptly stops attacking her, staggering backwards,
          examining his hands as if he can't believe what he's done.
          Seething with fury. Panting.
                         
          Elise collapses, catching her breath.
                         
          Josh swipes a framed photo off the wall and storms away,
          heading down the corridor...
                         
          ...swallowed up by the darkness.
           103.
                         
                         
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          Renai furrows her brow.
                         
                          RENAI
           What was that?
           (beat; to Dalton)
           Stay here.
                         
          She gets up.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Renai jogs into the living room. Sees Elise lying on the
          floor.
                         
                          RENAI
           Elise, what was that noise?
                         
          Elise simply looks up at her. The utter terror on her face is
          palpable. Her neck is bleeding from scratch marks.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Jesus...what happened to you?
                         
          Elise just stares, unable to speak. Her fear is contagious.
                         
                          RENAI (CONT'D)
           Where's Josh?
                          (BEAT)
           Josh? Josh?!
                         
          She turns and runs into the corridor, flicking on the lights.
                         
          There is nobody there.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Renai dashes from room to room in the hallway, pitching each
          door open.
                         
          Each room is empty. Josh is nowhere to be found.
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          Elise stares at Tucker's camera in a state of catatonic dread.
                         
          Renai backs into the room, her own fear rising in her gut.
          She leans down and grabs Elise by the shoulders.
           104.
                         
                         
                          RENAI
           Elise, what happened? You're
           scaring me, tell me where Josh is?
                         
          Elise finally looks up at her. Seeing the "expert" so afraid
          unnerves Renai. When the lion-tamer drops his whip and runs,
          you know the lion is vicious.
                         
          Elise opens her mouth to speak...but nothing comes out.
                         
          Instead, she simply holds up the camera, showing Renai the
          digital display of the photo she took.
                         
          We do not see it.
                         
          We simply see the look of horror on Renai's face.
                         
                          FLASHCUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
                         
          We have returned to the previous scene - only now we are
          seeing it through Elise's eyes.
                         
          Elise is sitting on the couch, alone. Trying to recover from
          the nights events.
                         
          She glances up when Josh approaches her.
                         
                          JOSH
           You introduced me to a new world.
                         
                          ELISE
           No. You've been there before,
           remember? And you'll go back.
                          (BEAT)
           All of us will...eventually.
                         
                          JOSH
           Maybe I can forget again.
                         
          Once again, we see him reach into his jacket, taking out the
          photos Lorraine gave him.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           I'll start by giving these back.
                         
          As he hands them to Elise, she sees with fear that his hand
          is withered and wrinkled.
                         
          Shocked, she looks up at his face.
           105.
                         
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           What's wrong?
                         
          Elise stands up, not knowing how to react.
                         
                          ELISE
           Nothing, I...
                         
          She turns away, reaching for something. We see her scoop up
          Tucker's digital camera.
                         
                          JOSH
           What's the matter, Elise?
                         
          She spins around and lifts Tucker's camera up to her face,
          aiming it at him. She depresses the trigger and takes a photo
          of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light.
                         
          --and in that split second, Josh is replaced by the Old
          Woman!
                         
          Elise lowers the camera, horrified. For a beat, the Old Woman
          just glares at her...
                         
          ...then she CHARGES at Elise, arms outstretched, wrapping her
          white hands around the soft flesh of Elise's throat.
                         
          Elise CHOKES, eyes bulging, spittle flying from her mouth, as
          the pale hands of the Old Woman dig into her thorax, droplets
          of blood running down her chest where the yellowing finger-
          nails have CUT IN to the flesh.
                         
          The Old Woman smiles - a merciless harlequin grin that mocks
          Elise's pain.
                         
          She lets Elise go, letting her drop to the floor.
                         
          The Old Woman turns and glares down the corridor. Something
          has caught her attention. A distant scream.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The door groans open, a blade of light penetrating pitch
          black darkness.
                         
          The silhouette of the Old Woman floats ethereally into the
          bathroom. She steps up to the mirror, then reaches into her
          tattered Victorian dress and produces a candle.
                         
          She lights the candle with a match, holding it beneath her
          chin and glaring into the reflective surface of the mirror.
           106.
                         
                         
          Instead of seeing her own reflection though, she sees THROUGH
          the mirror as if it were a window.
                         
          In it, she can see the BASEMENT of the Lambert's previous
          residence.
                         
          Josh bursts into the basement, carrying Dalton.
                         
                          DALTON
           Put me down, I can run!
                         
          Josh sets Dalton down, who scampers up the stairs.
                         
          We are watching the same scene we saw earlier play out in the
          mirror.
                         
          Josh is about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar
          face. He looks at the Old Woman...seeing her through the
          `window'.
                         
                          DALTON (CONT'D)
           Come on, dad! Come on!
                         
                          JOSH
           Go! I'm right behind you!
                         
          Dalton disappears as Josh glares at the woman.
                         
                          JOSH (CONT'D)
           You...what do you want from me?
                         
          He approaches the mirror. WE CIRCLE AROUND the Old Woman,
          past the mirror and THROUGH THE BATHROOM WALL, emerging on
          the other side in--
                         
                         
          INT. BASEMENT, LAMBERT HOME, INSIDE THE FURTHER
                         
          --the basement.
                         
          Josh screams at the Old Woman as she stares at him through
          what he thinks is a window. THEY HAVE SWAPPED PLACES. He is
          now in The Further, and she is in our world.
                         
                          JOSH
           Get away the fuck away from me. I'm
           not scared of you, just leave me
           alone! Get away from me!
                         
          We KEEP CIRCLING, wiping past Josh's back and completing a
          360 degree turn, THROUGH THE WALL and back into--
           107.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, NEW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          --our world.
                         
          The Old Woman smiles at Josh's rage. She finds it amusing.
                         
          With an eerily unblinking gaze, she snuffs out the plume of
          flame with a single puff of breath...plunging the bathroom
          into darkness...
                         
          ...and snuffing out Josh forever...
                         
                         
                         
          ...and ever.
                         
           FADE OUT.
