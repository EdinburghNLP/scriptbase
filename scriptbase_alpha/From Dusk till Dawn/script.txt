     FADE IN:

     EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

     A convenience store in a Texas Suburb. No other businesses
     surround it.

     CLOSE-UP: A light switch is flipped on.

     The sign on top of the store lights up. It reads: BENNY'S
     WORLD OF LIQUOR.

     TITLE CARD:

                    BIG SPRING, TEXAS
                  109 MILES WEST OF ABILENE
               345 MILES EAST OF THE MEXICAN BORDER

     A Texas Ranger patrol car pulls into the parking lot and
     a real live Texas Ranger, EARL MCGRAW, steps out. McGraw is
     in full ranger uniform - button shirt, cowboy hat, boots,
     mirrored shades, tin star and a colt revolver on his hip.

     It's about an hour and a half before sundown and McGraw is
     off duty for the day.

     The only other car in the parking lot is a 1975 Plymouth


     INT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

     A young Hawaiian Shirt wearing man named PETE sits on a
     stool behind the counter.

     A few CLOSE-UP:STOMERS fiddle about.

     A MAN wearing a black suit, black tie, and wire rim
     glasses holds hands with a PRETTY BLONDE GIRL in cutoffs and
     bare feet. They look through magazines.

     Another black suit wearing MAN holds hands with a RED-HEADED
     GIRL in a prep school uniform. They look through the
     beer cooler in the back of the store. Both girls are around
     seventeen.

     MCGRAW enters the store.

                    MCGRAW
          Hot goddamn day!

                    PETE
          Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with
          the air conditioner blastin' all day
          long.

                    MCGRAW
          Not even for lunch?

                    PETE
          I'm by myself today, ate my lunch
          outta the microwave.

     McGraw walks over to the beer cooler, as if done ritually
     every night (it is), takes out a beer, pops it open and
     joins Pete by the front counter.

                    MCGRAW
          Jesus Christ man, that microwave food
          will kill ya as quick as a bullet.
          Those burritos are only fit for a
          hippie high on weed. Pull me down a
          bottle of Jack Daniels. I'm gettin'
          tanked tonight.

                    PETE
          Whatsamatter?

                    MCGRAW
               (sighs)
          Awww, it's just been a shitass day.
          Every inch of it hot and miserable.
          First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip
          got some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid
          boy of hers was workin' the grill.
          That fuckin' idiot don't know rat shit
          from Rice Krispies. I ate breakfast
          at nine, was pukin' up pigs in a
          blanket like a sick dog by ten
          thirty.

                    PETE
          Isn't there a law or something
          against retards serving food to the
          public?

                    MCGRAW
          Well, if there ain't there sure oughta
          be. Who knows what goes on inside 
          Mongoloid's mind?

                    PETE
          You could sue the shit out of her, ya
          know. That kid belongs under a circus
          tent, not flippin' burgers. You could
          own that fuckin' place.

                    MCGRAW
          What the hell would I do with that
          grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got
          enough of a cross to bear just taking
          care of that potato head. Then all
          this Abilene shit happened. You
          heard about that bank robbery in
          Abilene, didn't ya?

                    PETE
          That's all that's been on the box
          all day. They killed some people
          didn't they?

                    MCGRAW
          Four Rangers, three cops, and two
          civilians. And they took a lady bank
          teller as a hostage.

     Pete doesn't say anything.

                    MCGRAW
          They'll probably make a run for the
          border, which would bring 'em this
          way. And if we get our hands on
          those shit asses, we're talking
          payback time. We'll get 'em all right.
          I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your
          commode.

                    PETE
          Knock yourself out.

     McGraw drops his last drip of beer, crushes the can and
     exits in the bathroom.

     The black suited man by the beer cooler turns around and,
     with the prep school girl in tow, walks rapidly toward Pete.
     We see that the girl is crying.

                    BLACK SUITED MAN #1
               (to Pete)
          Do you think I'm fuckin' playing with
          you, asshole?
               (points to the tearful prep
                school girl)
          Do you want this little girl to die?
               (pointing to the blonde with
                the other guy)
          Or that little girl? Or your
          bosombuddy with the badge? Or
          yourself? I don't wanna do it, but
          I'll turn this fuckin' store into the
          Wild Bunch if I even think you're
          fuckin' with me.

     The two men in black suits are the notorious Abilene
     bank robbers, SETH and RICHARD GECKO, "The Gecko Brothers."
     And the other customers are all being held hostage. Seth
     is the one with the prep girl. Richard is the one with
     the blonde.

     Everybody speaks low and fast.

                    PETE
          What do you want from me? I did what
          you said.

                    SETH
          Letting him use your toilet? No store
          does that.

                    PETE
          He comes in here every day and we
          bullshit. He's used my toilet a
          thousand times. If I told him no,
          he'd know something was up.

                    SETH
          I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta
          here, in his car, and down the road or
          you can change the name of this
          place to "Benny's World of Blood."

     Richard, holding tightly the hand of the terrified girl,
     leans next to Seth's ear and whispers something. Seth looks
     at Pete.

                    SETH
          Were you giving that pig signals?

                    PETE
          What? Are you kidding? I didn't do
          anything!

     Richard whispers something else in Seth's ear.

                    SETH
          He says you were scratching.

                    PETE
          I wasn't scratching!

                    SETH
          You callin' him a liar?

     Pete controls himself.

                    PETE
          I'm not calling him a liar, okay? I'm
          simply saying that if I was
          scratching, and if I did scratch, it's
          not because I was signaling the cop,
          it's because I'm fuckin' scared
          shitless.

     Richard speaks for the first time in a low calm voice to
     Seth.

                    RICHARD
          The Ranger's taking a piss. Why don't
          I just go in there, blow his head off
          and get outta here.

                    PETE
          Don't do that! Look, you asked me to
          act natural, and I'm acting as natural
          -- in fact, under the circumstances, I
          think I ought get a fuckin' Academy
          Award for how natural I'm acting. You
          asked me to get rid of him, I'm doing
          my best.

                    SETH
          Yeah, well, your best better get a
          helluva lot fuckin' better, or you're
          gonna feel a helluva fuckin' lot
          worse.

     The toilet FLUSHES.

                    SETH
          Everybody be cool.

     Everybody goes back to what they were doing.

     McGraw steps back out of the back. He appears to be unaware
     of the situation.

                    MCGRAW
          Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at
          it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit
          in front of the box and just drink
          booze. How much is the bottle?

                    PETE
          Six-fifty.

     Out of nowhere Richard WHIPS out his forty-five automatic
     and SHOOTS McGraw in the head.

     McGraw goes down screaming.

     Richard stands over him and SHOOTS him twice more.

     Seth charges forward.

                    SETH
               (to Richard)
          What the fuck was that about?

                    RICHARD
               (in a low monotone)
          He signaled the Ranger.

                    PETE
               (hysterical)
          I didn't.
               (to Seth)
          You gotta believe me, I didn't.

                    RICHARD
               (to Seth)
          When they were talkin', he mouthed
          the words "Help Us."

                    PETE
          You fuckin' liar, I didn't say shit!

     Richard SHOOTS Pete and Pete falls down behind the counter.

     Seth grabs Richard and throws him up against the wall.

                    SETH
          What the fuck is wrong with you --

                    RICHARD
          Seth, he did it. You were by the beer
          cooler with your back turned. I was by
          the magazines, I could see his face.
          And I saw him mouth:

     Richard mouths the words, "Help Us."

     While Pete lies on the floor behind the counter bleeding
     from his bullet wound, he opens his floor safe and pulls
     out a gun from it.

     Seth releases his brother.

                    SETH
          Start the car.

                    RICHARD
          You believe me don't cha?

                    SETH
          Shut up and start the car.

     Richard walks away from Seth and crosses the counter...

     ...when Pete SPRINGS up, gun in hand, and SHOOTS Richard in
     the hand.

     Richard FALLS to his knees, howling.

     Both Pete and Seth SPRAY the store with gunfire.

     Seth DIVES down an aisle. He reloads.

     Pete DUCKS behind the counter. He reloads.

     Richard has crawled to safety behind an aisle.

     The two girls have run out screaming.


                    SETH
               (yelling)
          Richie? You okay?

                    RICHARD
               (yelling)
          I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot!
          I told you that bastard said, "Help
          us!"

                    PETE
               (yelling)
          I never said help us!

                    SETH
               (yelling)
          Well that don't matter now, 'cause
          you got about two fuckin' seconds
          to live! Richie!

                    RICHARD
               (yelling)
          Yeah?

                    SETH
               (yelling)
          When I count three, shoot out the
          bottles behind him!

                    RICHARD
          Gotcha!

                    SETH
          One... Two... Three.


     The two brothers start FIRING toward the counter.

     They HIT the bottles of alcohol on the shelf behind Pete.

     Pete is crouched on the ground as glass, debris and alcohol
     RAIN down on him.

     Seth grabs a roll of paper towels from off a shelf.

     Richard keeps FIRING.

     Seth douses the paper towels with lighter fluid, sets it on
     fire with his Zippo, then tosses it.

     The flaming roll of paper towels FLIES through the air.

     The fireball lands behind the counter.

     The entire counter area immediately BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Pete
     screams from behind the counter.

     Seth smiles to himself and stands.

     Richard shakes his head in amusement and stands.

     Pete runs out from behind the counter, ENGULFED IN FLAMES
     still holding his weapon and FIRING.

     Seth and Richard hit the ground FIRING their .45's.

     Pete, the human torch, FALLS like a tree into the Hostess
     Pastry display.

     Seth and Richard rise from the rubble.



     EXT. BENNY'S WORLD OF LIQUOR - DAY

     They exit the store squabbling. The store is bursting into
     flames.

                    SETH
          What did I tell you? What did I tell
          you? Buy the road map and leave.

                    RICHARD
          What am I supposed to do, Seth?
          He recognized us.

                    SETH
          He didn't recognize shit.

     Both Seth and Richard stand on opposite sides of the car.

                    RICHARD
          Seth, I'm telling you, the way he
          looked at us -- you especially --
          I knew he knew.


     They both climb in the car, Seth behind the wheel. Seth
     starts it op. The souped up engine ROARS to life. We can
     hear Seth mumbling under the motor.

                    SETH
          Low profile. Do you know what the
          words "low profile" mean?

     CLOSE-UP: SETH'S FOOT PUNCHES GAS.

     The Plymouth tears out of the parking lot backwards, hits
     the street, and speeds off down the road.

     We CRANE UP HIGH to see the car leaving a trail of dust
     behind it, as the store burns out of control.

     OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE.

     Raunchy, honky-tonk MUSIC fills the theater.

                                          CUT TO:


     EXT. TEXAS PANHANDLE - DAY

     The Plymouth tears ass across Texas plains. As TITLES PLAY
     OVER, we see Seth and Richard enjoying their getaway/road
     trip. Seth behind the wheel, pops open a bottle of
     prescription pills, empties out four of the red capsules in
     his hand, pops them in his mouth, and washes it back with a
     slug of Jack Daniel's from a pint bottle.

     Richard looks at Seth through the hole in his hand. Like a
     boxer, Richard wraps his wounded hand with gaffer's tape.

     The camera leaves the boys, as they woosh down the street,
     and goes along the length of the car to the trunk. It hangs
     on the trunk. Then we see through the trunk, like Superman:

     AN OLDER WOMAN tied up and helpless in the trunk.

     The rest of the titles play over black as the song
     continues.

     CREDIT SEQUENCE ENDS

                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

     Emma and Pete's Gravy Train is a truck stop off of Highway
     290.

     SUBTITLE APPEARS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN':

             FORT STOCKTON
          238 MILES FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER


     INT. EMMA AND PETE'S GRAVY TRAIN - DAY

     Emma and Pete's PATRONS are made up of regulars, truckers,
     cowboys and road-weary travelers. The CAMERA DOLLIES through
     the maze of tables, patrons, and waitresses.

     It stops when it gets to a table occupied by the FULLER
     FAMILY. The Fullers definitely fall into the road-weary
     category. The members of the unit consist of the father,
     JACOB, age 44, an ex-preacher, a good man with rough edges,
     and his two children, KATE, age 19, is a young beauty who
     possesses what can only be described as an apple pie
     sensuality. She is dressed like a nice Christian girl,
     complete with crucifix. SCOTT, age 16, is a Jacob's
     Vietnamese adopted son. Scott is a likable, long-haired kid
     who always wears a T-shirt with the name of the heavy metal
     garage band he plays guitar for, "Precinct 13." The three
     of them are wolfing down a late lunch.

                    JACOB
          We got about two more hours of day
          light left. That'll get us into
          El Paso, which is right next to the
          border. We'll stop at a motel --

                    SCOTT
          Stop? We're not going to actually
          stop at a motel, are we?

     Scott and Kate speak together, obviously repeating something
     that Jacob has said about three hundred times.

                    SCOTT AND KATE
          We've got a Winnebago. We don't need
          those over priced roach havens. We're
          self contained.

                    JACOB
          Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little
          overzealous, but give me a break, I
          just bought it.

     Scott and Kate continue the impersonation.

                    SCOTT
          Why, just look at all this. You got
          your kitchen --

                    KATE
          -- you got your microwave --

                    SCOTT
          -- you got your sink --

                    KATE
          -- you got your shower --

                    SCOTT
          -- see this, television!

                    KATE
          Feel this, real wood paneling. That's
          real wood, too, not that fake stuff.

                    JACOB
          Unless you two wiseacres wanna be
          introduced to the joys of hitchhiking,
          what say we drop this?

                    SCOTT
               (to Kate)
          The truth hurts.

                    KATE
               (to Scott)
          It's the bitterest of pills.

                    JACOB
          You two ought to start a stand-up
          act, because you're just wasting your
          humor on me.

                    KATE
          Ain't it the truth.

                    SCOTT
          Why do you want to stop?

                    JACOB
          I'm exhausted.

                    SCOTT
          Lie in the back, Dad, I'll drive us
          into Mexico.

     Jacob gives Scott a look that says, "You aren't touching my
     new motor home."

                    JACOB
          I just bet you would. Don't even thin
          about it. Besides, I want to have one
          night's sleep in an
          honest-to-goodness bed. The beds in
          the home are okay, but they're not
          like a real bed.

                    KATE
          Hey, if we go to a motel, we can
          swim.

                    SCOTT
          I'll be right back. I'm gonna go to
          the bathroom.

     Scott gets up from the table and walks out back to the
     restroom.

     Jacob and Kate are left alone. There's an awkward moment of
     silence before...

                    KATE
          Dad, when I called the machine to
          check our messages there was one from
          Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he
          wouldn't permanently replace you until
          we came back. He said when we come
          home, if you still feel the same
          way --

                    JACOB
          That's very nice of Ted, but I'll
          call him tomorrow and tell him not
          to bother waiting.

                    KATE
          I didn't want to talk about this in
          front of Scott because he gets upset.
          But you don't believe in God
          anymore?

                    JACOB
          Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I
          know this is hard on you kids. After
          Jenny's death, this is probably the
          last thing you need. But I can't do
          it any longer. My congregation needs
          spiritual leadership. Well, they can't
          get that from me anymore. My faith is
          gone. To answer your question, yes,
          I do believe in Jesus. But do I love
          them? No. After Jenny died, I just
          thought, what's the point?

                    KATE
               (pushing him)
          It's just, all our lives you've been
          a pastor. For twenty years you've
          preached trust in the lord. And then
          one day you wake up and say fuck him?

                    JACOB
          I didn't say fuck him. I'm just not
          connected anymore.

                    KATE
          That happens, you'll get it back.

                    JACOB
          Kate, give your old man a little
          credit. Every person who chooses the
          service of God as their life's work
          has something in common. I don't care
          if you're a preacher, a priest, a nun,
          a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many,
          many times during your life you'll
          look at your reflection in the mirror
          and ask yourself, am I a fool? We've
          all done it. I'm not going through a
          lapse. What I've experienced is closer
          to awakening. I'm not trying to shake
          your faith. I've just decided not to
          devote my life to God anymore.

                    KATE
          What do you think Mom would say?

                    JACOB
          Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.

                                          CUT TO:

     CLOSE UP: COUNTER BELL. A hand slams down on it. RING.


     INT. LOBBY - DEW DROP INN - DAY

     Seth stands at the front desk of the Dew Drop Inn. A
     standard issue Texas motel. Richard sits outside in the car.
     Nobody responds to the bell. Seth BANGS it impatiently five
     times.

                    TEXAS VOICE (O.S.)
          Hold your horses!

     An OLD-TIMER walks through a curtain behind the counter.
     He's eating a BBQ rib.

                    OLD-TIMER
               (rough)
          Whatcha want?

                    SETH
          Whatcha think I want, ya mean old
          bastard? I wanna room.


     EXT. COURTYARD - DEW DROP INN - DAY

     Richard sits in the car listening to Merle Haggard on the
     radio. He watches from his perspective, Seth taking the
     walking outside and getting in the car. Seth starts it up,
     and drives them to their room.

                    RICHARD
          Do they have cable?

                    SETH
          No.

                    RICHARD
          Do they have an X-rated channel?

                    SETH
          No.

                    RICHARD
          Do they have a waterbed?

                    SETH
          They don't have anything except four
          walls and a roof, and that's all we
          need.

     Their car drives up to room #9, but they park backing up the
     trunk close to the door.

     The two brothers get out of the car.

                    SETH
               (tossing Richie the motel keys)
          Open the door. We gotta do this fast.

     Richie opens the door.

     Seth goes to the trunk, looks around the court yard. It's
     empty.

     CLOSE UP: KEY going into the trunk lock, turning.

     TRUNK POV: Seth looking into the camera.

     SETH'S POV: A WOMAN in her late forties is lying scrunched
          up in the trunk.

     She is the HOSTAGE BANK TELLER from Abilene. She's stiff,
     scared and looks an absolute mess.

                    SETH
          Don't say a word.

     The two brothers, quick as lightening, yank the woman out of
     the trunk and whisk her into the motel room. SETH closes the
     trunk, looks around for any Johnny eye-witnesses, doesn't
     see any, slams the door.


     INT. SETH AND RICHARD'S ROOM - DAY

     Seth turns from the door, sees the hostage woman standing.

                    SETH
          You. Plant yourself in that chair.

     She sits down in the chair.

                    HOSTAGE
          What are you planning on doing with --

                    SETH
          -- I said plant yourself. Plants don't
          talk. You wanna get on my good side?
          Just sit still and don't make a peep.

     She shuts up.

     Richard slowly takes off his jacket. He winces from his
     wound.

                    SETH
          Let me help you.

     He helps him get his jacket off.

                    SETH
          How's it feel?

                    RICHARD
          How ya think, it hurts like a
          son-of-a-bitch.

     Richie goes over to the bed and lies down on it. Seth takes
     the pillow and stacks them for Richie to prop his back up
     against.

                    SETH
          I got both rooms on either side of us,
          so we don't gotta worry about
          eavesdropping assholes. How's that
          feel? You okay?

                    RICHARD
          Feels good.

                    SETH
          I'm gonna go get the money.

     He heads for the door.


     EXT. COURTYARD - MOTEL - DAY

     Seth goes into the car, takes out a big suitcase. He scans
     the perimeter with his eyes, goes back inside.


     INT. MOTEL ROOM #9 - DAY

     Seth comes back in, lays the suitcase on the bed. Richie has
     the TV remote control in his hand and he's flipping
     stations. Seth looks at his watch.

                    SETH
          It's about five o'clock.
               (to hostage)
          What time does it get dark around
          here?

                    HOSTAGE
          About seven.

                    SETH
          Good. I'm going towards the border to
          check things out while it's still
          daylight. Call Carlos and arrange the
          rendezvous.

                    RICHARD
          Hey, when you talk to him, see if you
          can arrange a better deal than thirty
          percent.

                    SETH
          That's their standard deal, brother.
          They ain't about to change it for us.

                    RICHARD
          Did you even to try to negotiate?

                    SETH
          These guys ain't spic fire cracker
          salesman from Tijuana. They don't even
          know the meaning of the word "barter".
          You wanna stay in El Ray? You give
          them thirty percent of your loot. It's
          scripture. So it is written, so shall
          it be done. You want sanctuary, you
          pay the price, and the price is thirty
          percent.

                    RICHARD
          All I'm saying --

                    SETH
          -- This conversation is over.

     Richie shrugs and turns back to TV, Seth turns to the
     hostage, grabs a chair and slides it up in front of her.

                    SETH
          Now, we need to have a talk. What's
          your name?

                    HOSTAGE
          Gloria.

     He shakes her hand.

                    SETH
          Hello, Gloria, I'm Seth and that's my
          brother Richie. Let's cut to the
          chase. I'm gonna ask you a question
          and all I want is a yes or no answer.
          Do you want to live through this?

                    GLORIA
          Yes.

                    SETH
          Good. Then let me explain the house
          rules. Follow the rules, we'll get
          along like a house on fire. Rule number
          one: No noise, no question. You make a
          noise...
               (he holds up his .45)
          ...Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask a
          question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are
          you absolutely, positively clear about
          rule number one?

                    GLORIA
          Yes.

                    SETH
          Rule number two: You do what we say,
          when we say it. If you don't, see rule
          number one.

     Seth takes the .45, places the barrel next to the woman's
     cheek. She squirms and shuts her eyes. He pulls back the
     hammer.

                    SETH
          Rule number three: Don't you ever try
          and fuckin' run on us. 'Cause I got
          five little friends, and they all run
          faster 'n you can. Got it?

     She nods her head yes.

     He takes the gun away and replaces the hammer.

                    SETH
          Open your eyes.

     She does.

                    SETH
          Gloria, you hang in there, follow the
          rules, and don't fuck with us, you'll
          get out of this alive. I give you my
          word. Okay?

     She nods her head yes.

     Seth rises.

                    SETH
          I'll be back in a bit.

     He exits.

     Richard looks to the TV, then looks to Gloria sitting
     across the room in the chair.


                    RICHARD
          Wanna come up here on the bed and
          watch TV with me?


     You can tell she doesn't want to.

     He pats the empty space next to him.

                    RICHARD
          Come on.

     She gets out of her chair, walks across the bed, and sits
     next to him.


     EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

     A phone booth outside of a gas station. Seth is in the
     middle of a conversation with the party on the other end.

                    SETH
          Things are real hot here. Crossing's
          gonna be a bitch.
               (pause)
          Don't worry, we'll get across. But
          when we do, where do we go?
               (pause)
          Can we make it as close to the border
          as possible? Texas wants our balls.
          The quicker we're in your protection,
          the better I'll feel.
               (pause)
          Okay, where?
               (pause)
          The Titty Twister?
               (he laughs)
          I love it already. Okay, Carlos, I'll
          see you and your men at the "Titty
          Twister" tomorrow morning.
               (pause)
          Bye, my friend.

     Seth hangs up the phone, lights up a cigarette with his
     Zippo lighter and exits frame. After Seth exits, leaving
     the frame empty, a subtitle appears:

               EL PASO

     INT. SETH AND RICHARD'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

     Richard lies on the bed by himself, propped up by pillows,
     watching TV, taking on hits from a water bong in the
     shape of a wizard.

                    KELLY HOUGE
          Heading the case to bring these
          fugitives to justice is FBI agent
          Stanley Chase. We talked with agent
          Chase earlier this afternoon.

     VIDEO INTERVIEW

     Kelly Houge interviewing STANLEY CHASE of the FBI.

                    STANLEY CHASE
          For the time being we are very
          confident we will apprehend the
          fugitives in the next forty-eight
          hours. The Bureau, local law
          enforcement and the Texas Rangers
          have all joined forces in forming a
          dragnet to snare Seth and Richard
          Gecko.

                    KELLY HOUGE
          Agent Chase, does it appear that they
          are heading for Mexico.

                    STANLEY CHASE
          Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already
          alerted the Mexican authorities. They
          intend to cooperate every way possible
          in bringing these fugitives to
          justice.

                    KELLY HOUGE
          Are you optimistic about the safety of
          the hostage they took in Abilene,
          Gloria Hill?

                    STANLEY CHASE
          We've received no news one way or the
          other. We can only hope for the best.

                    KELLY HOUGE
          What about the report from an
          eyewitness at the liquor store who
          said one of the brothers was shot?

                    STANLEY CHASE
          This can't be confirmed at this time,
          but we do believe it to be true. We
          have reason to believe it was the
          youngest brother Richard, and he was
          shot in the vicinity of his neck and
          shoulders by the store's clerk.

                    KELLY HOUGE
          Is it safe to assume that because the
          death count involved and the loss of
          life of law enforcement officers, that
          the Bureau, the Rangers and the police
          force are taking this manhunt
          personally?

                    STANLEY CHASE
          I would say that's a very safe
          assumption.

                    RICHARD
               (Newscaster's voice)
          Is it safe to assume since the law
          enforcement authorities in the great
          state of Texas are homosexuals of a
          sick and deviate nature, that they
          will be too busy fucking each other
          up the ass to actually catch The
          Gecko Brothers?
               (in an FBI voice)
          I would say that's a very safe
          assumption.

     He changes a channel on the television. We see a Casper the
     Friendly Ghost cartoon on the screen.

                    CASPER
          Would you play with me?

     A big burly COP turns around.

                    COP
          Sure, little boy... A GHOST!!!

     The cop heads for the hills. Casper cries.

     Seth enters the room carrying a six pack of beer and two
     take-out bags of Big Kahuna burgers.

                    RICHARD
          Shit, I started to get worried. Where
          the fuck ya been?

                    SETH
          Sight seein'.

                    RICHARD
          What'd ya see?

                    SETH
          Cops.

                    RICHARD
          Didya look at the border?

     Seth dumps the burgers on the bed. Both men pop open beers
     and Richard goes to town on a hamburger. Seth flips off
     the TV

                    SETH
          Yeah, I saw the border. Through
          binoculars from on top of a high
          building. That's about as close as I
          risked getting. What's the TV say?

                    RICHARD
          They're going to apprehend us in
          forty-eight hours.

     Seth sits down and takes a hit off his beer.

                    SETH
               (to himself)
          I gotta figure a way to get across
          that goddamn border. Longer we fuck
          around El Paso our lives ain't worth
          a shit.

                    RICHARD
          Look, fuck the border. Let's just dig
          in and wait for things to cool down.

                    SETH
          Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin'
          worse before it gets any fuckin'
          better. We showed our ass in Texas. We
          killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They
          ain't gonna stop lookin' till they
          find us, and when they find us,
          they're gonna kill us. Texans take it
          very personal when ya kill their law
          enforcement officers. The El Paso
          police have already started a motel
          and hotel search for us.

                    RICHARD
          How do you know?

                    SETH
          I heard it on the radio. We gotta get
          our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos
          is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a
          rendezvous on the other side, then
          Carlos and his boys will escort us to
          El Ray and --

     Seth stops talking and looks around.

                    SETH
          Where's the woman?

                    RICHARD
          What?

     Seth's out of his chair.

                    SETH
          What'd ya mean, what? The fuckin'
          woman, the hostage. Where the fuck
          is she, Richard!?

                    RICHARD
          She's in the other room.

                    SETH
          What the fuck is she doin' there?!

     He goes to the door of the adjoining room.

                    RICHARD
          Seth, before you open the door, let
          me explain what happened.

     Seth stops and looks at his brother. He knows what he means.
     He can't say anything, only point at his younger sibling.
     Then he BURSTS open the door.

     The dead, naked body of Gloria Hill lies on the bed. It's
     obvious Richard raped her and killed her.

     Seth covers his eyes with his hands. He slowly enters the
     room with the dead body.

                    SETH
               (to himself)
          Oh, Richard, what's wrong with you?

     Richard rises from the bed.

                    RICHARD
          Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me
          just explain what happened.

     Seth slowly turns to his brother, then walks toward him.

     Richard backs up.

                    SETH
          Yeah, explain it to me. I need an
          explanation. What's the matter with
          you?

                    RICHARD
               (low and calm)
          There's nothing wrong with me,
          brother. That woman tried to escape
          and I did what I had to do.

                    SETH
          No.
               (pause)
          That woman wouldn't of said shit if
          she had a mouthful.

                    RICHARD
          Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
          wrong, wrong! Once you left, she
          became a whole different person.

                    SETH
               (slowly approaching)
          Is it me? Is it my fault?

                    RICHARD
          It's not your fault, it's her fault!

     Seth grabs Richard and THROWS him in the corner of the room,
     holding tightly to his wrist.

                    SETH
          Is this my fault? Do you think this
          is what I am?

                    RICHARD
          What?

                    SETH
          This is not me! I am a professional
          fucking thief. I steal money. You try
          to stop me, god help you. But I don't
          kill people I don't have to, and I
          don't rape women. What you doin' ain't
          how it's done. Do you understand?

                    RICHARD
          Seth, if you were me --

                    SETH
          Just say yes! Nothing else, just say
          yes.

                    RICHARD
          Yes.

                    SETH
          Yes, Seth, I understand.

                    RICHARD
          Yes, Seth, I understand.

     Seth hugs his little brother. Tight.

                    SETH
               (whispers in Richie's ear)
          We get into Mexico, it's gonna be
          sweet Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor,
          and rice and beans. None of this
          shit's gonna matter.


     INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

     Scott and Kate are in the front seat of their parked motor
     home. The motor home's parked in front of the Dew Drop
     Inn's front office. We see Jacob inside getting a room from
     the Old-Timer.

                    KATE
          I can't believe he's stopping here.
          This place looks totally cruddy.

     Jacob walks out of the office. Kate yells from the motor
     home.

                    KATE
          Dad, why are we stopping here?

     He opens the meter home door and climbs in.

                    JACOB
          There's nothing wrong with this
          place.

                    KATE
          It's a flop house.

                    JACOB
          It's not a flop house. It's basic
          and simple. That doesn't make it a
          flop house.

                    KATE
          If it doesn't have a pool, we're
          looking for a new place.

     Starting the huge car and slowly maneuvering it through the
     courtyard.

                    JACOB
          It has a bed. That's all I care about.

                    KATE
          Other places have beds, they also have
          cable TV, a gym, room service...


     EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

     Seth walks out of room #9 with a beer in his hand. He's
     thinking about how he's going to get over the border
     tonight. Lost in thought, he steps out in the path of the
     Fuller's motor home.

     Jacob slams on the brakes. Seth jumps back, startled. Both
     Kate and Scott are TOSSED out of their seats onto the floor.
     THUD... THUD...

                    KATE
          Owww, my head.

     Jacob (pissed) honks his horn at Seth and yells out the
     window.

                    JACOB
          Watch where you're going!

     THROUGH WINDSHIELD

     Seth just stands right in their way without moving, gazing
     up at the giant motor home.

     JACOB BEHIND THE WHEEL

     Kate and Scott join him up front looking at this weirdo.

                    SCOTT
          What's this guy's problem?

                    JACOB
          I have no idea.

     Seth continues standing in their way, making no attempt to
     move. Not threatening, just looking at them.

     HONK!

                    JACOB
          Anytime, man.

     The horn snaps Seth back to this world. A smile breaks out
     on the escaped fugitive's face and he politely steps to one
     side to let them pass.

     Pass they do!

                    KATE
          Creepy guy.

     SETH

     The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's
     just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed
     unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the
     border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into
     room #9.


     INT. FULLERS' MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

     The Fullers are in room #12. It's identical to the one that
     the Gecko boys are in, except that the paintings above the
     beds are different. Jacob has fallen asleep in his clothes
     on the bed.

     Scott sits in a chair, headphones on, playing an unplugged
     electric guitar. Kate is nowhere in sight.

     KNOCK... KNOCK... KNOCK... on the door. Scott doesn't hear
     shit but his music. Jacob stirs a bit, but doesn't wake up.
     POUND... POUND... POUND... on the door. Jacob SPRINGS UP.
     He looks over at Scott, who, lost in guitar heaven, is
     oblivious of the knocker, then to the door.

                    JACOB
               (yelling)
          What?

     From the other side of the door comes a friendly voice.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          I'm your neighbor in room 9, I hate to
          disturb you, but I'd like to ask a favor.

     Jacob swings his feet to the floor, stands up and walks to
     the door. As he passes Scott, he says, in his direction --

                    JACOB
          I hope none of this is disturbing you.

     Scott can't hear him, but when he sees his dad look at him,
     he smiles.

     Jacob opens the door and sees...

     ... Richard Gecko standing in the doorway, looking like the
     nicest guy in the entire world.

                    RICHARD
          Hi there, I'm from room 9, my name is
          Don Cornelius. No, not the Don
          Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my
          lady friend need some ice and we don't
          seem to have an ice bucket. Could we
          possibly borrow yours? I'll bring it
          right back.

                    JACOB
               (still partially asleep)
          Sure.

     We follow Jacob as he turns to the dresser to get the motel
     ice bucket. He grabs it, turns back to the door, takes a
     couple of steps towards it, then stops: in his tracks.

     He sees Richard and Seth both inside the room with the door
     closed, both with .45's in their hands, both aimed at him.

                    JACOB
          What is this?

     Seth SLUGS Jacob in the mouth, KNOCKING him to the ground.

                    SETH
          It's called a punch.

     Scott suddenly becomes aware of what's going on around him
     and instinctively stands. Richard shoves his .45 in Scott's
     mouth.

                    RICHARD
          Sit down.

     Scott lowers himself back down onto his seat.

                    RICHARD
          Good boy.

     Jacob lifts his head off the floor and wipes blood away from
     his lip. He looks at his opponent who stands over him.

                    SETH
               (to Jacob)
          What's your name?

                    JACOB
          Jacob.

                    SETH
          Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass
          down on the bed. Make a wrong move and
          I'll shoot you in the face.

     Jacob rises and sits on the edge of the bed.

                    SETH
               (to Richard)
          Okay, move the Jap over there.

     Keeping the gun in Scott's mouth, Richard makes Scott rise...

                    RICHARD
          Upsy daisy.

     ...guiding him over to the bed by his father.

     Richard removes the gun from Scott's mouth and stands next
     to his brother, looking down at their two hostages.

                    SETH
               (to his hostages)
          What's the story with you two? You a
          couple of fags?

                    JACOB
          He's my son.

                    SETH
          How does that happen? You don't look
          Japanese.

                    JACOB
          Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.

                    SETH
          Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.

                    JACOB
          What's this about, money?

                    SETH
          It's about money, all right, but not
          yours. You see, me and my brother here
          are in a little hot water and we need
          your assistance.

     The door to room #12 opens and a dripping wet, bikini clad
     Kate walks in.

     The brothers spin their guns in her direction.

     Kate, startled, screams. Jacob and Scott get on their feet
     and move forward. Seth spins back towards the two men, gun
     ready to spit.

                    SETH
               (to Scott and Jacob)
          Stop!

     Jacob and Scott freeze.

     Richard moves like quicksilver, shutting the door and
     positioning himself behind the terrified Kate.

                    KATE
          What's going on?

                    RICHARD
          We're having a wet bikini contest,
          and you just won.

                    JACOB
               (to Kate)
          It's okay, honey. Everything's going
          to be all right.

                    SETH
          Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don't
          do nothin' stupid.
               (he turns to Jacob and Scott,
                who are still standing)
          You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!

     They slowly sit.

     Richard can't take his eyes off the dripping wet Kate.

     Both Jacob and Seth see this and neither men like it. Both
     for their own reasons.

                    SETH
               (to Jacob)
          Where are the keys to the motor home?

                    JACOB
          On the dresser.

                    SETH
          Richie, take the keys. Start that big
          bastard up, and drive it up front.

     Richard doesn't move from his position behind Kate. Kate
     feels his eyes on her. She slowly turns and looks at him.

     He looks in her face.

     CLOSE-UP KATE
          
     She smiles at him.

                    KATE
          Richie, will you do me a favor and eat
          my pussy?

     CLOSE-UP RICHARD
          
                    RICHARD
          Sure.


                    SETH (O.S.)
          Richard!

     Richard's eyes go to Seth.

     Everybody is where they were. Kate never turned around.

                    SETH
          Not when you get around to it, now.

     Without saying a word, he takes the keys and leaves the
     room.

                    SETH
               (pointing at Kate)
          You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and
          put on some clothes.

     She grabs some clothes from the floor and moves towards the
     bathroom.

     Seth GRABS her wrist.

                    SETH
          You got three minutes. One second
          longer, I shoot your father in the
          face. Do you understand what I just
          said?

                    KATE
          Yes.

                    SETH
          Do you believe me?

                    KATE
          Yes.

                    SETH
          You damn well better. Go.

     She goes into the bathroom.

                    JACOB
          Look, if you want the motor home, just
          take it and get out.

     Seth grabs a chair and slides it up to his two male
     hostages.

                    SETH
          Sorry, Pops, it ain't gonna be that
          easy.

     We hear the motor home "HONK" twice outside.

                    SETH
          Get ready to move out, we're all going
          on a little ride.

     Jacob shakes his head "no."

                    JACOB
          Not a chance.

                    SETH
          Come again?

                    JACOB
          If you're taking people, take me. But
          my kids aren't going anywhere with
          you.

                    SETH
          Sorry, I need everybody.

                    JACOB
          My children are not going with you,
          and that's that.

                    SETH
               (angry)
          That's not fuckin' that...
               (holds up his gun)
          this is fuckin' this.
               (he calms down and looks
                at Scott)
          Go sit over there.

     Scott gets up and walks to the other side of the room,
     leaving the two men alone. Seth speaks in a quiet,
     conversational tone.

                    SETH
          I ain't got time to fuck around with
          you, so I'll make this simple. Take
          your kids and get in the car, or I'll
          execute all three of you right now.
               (he cocks the gun and puts
                it right in Jacob's face)
          What's it gonna be, yes or no answer?

     Jacob looks at him.

                    JACOB
          Yes.

                    SETH
          Good.
               (to Scott)
          Your old man's all right, he just
          saved your life.

     Seth BANGS on the bathroom door.

                    SETH
          Times up, Princess.

     The bathroom door opens. Kate stands there, wearing a
     T-shirt, jeans and bare feet.

                    SETH
          Okay, ramblers, let's get to rambling.

                                          CUT TO:


     EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     The motor home with the powder-keg interior drives through
     the Lone Star night.


     INT. MOTOR HOME NIGHT

     Richard's in the back bed area with a gun trained on Kate
     and Scott. The two scared siblings hold hands.

                    KATE
          Excuse me.

     Richard zeros in on her.

                    RICHARD
          What?

                    KATE
          Where are you taking us?

                    RICHARD
          Mexico.

                    KATE
          What's in Mexico?

                    RICHARD
          Mexicans.

     He doesn't smile.

     In the front part of the motor home, Jacob sits behind the
     wheel, driving into the night. Seth sits in the passenger
     seat, going through Jacob's wallet and talking to him
     calmly.

                    SETH
               (reading his driver's license)
          Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical,
          ain't it? What am I askin' for, of
          course it is.
               (motioning behind him)
          What are their names?

                    JACOB
          Scott and Kate.

     Seth repeats the names as he thumbs through the wallet.

                    SETH
          Scott and Kate... Kate and Scott...
          Scott Fuller... Kate Fuller...

     Seth comes to a snapshot of Jacob and his wife.

                    SETH
          Who's this?

                    JACOB
          My wife.

                    SETH
          Where is the little lady?

                    JACOB
          In heaven.

                    SETH
          She's dead?

                    JACOB
          Yes, she is.

                    SETH
          How'd she die?

                    JACOB
          Auto wreck.

                    SETH
          Come on, gimme some more details.
          How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk
          kill her?

                    JACOB
          No. It was a rainy night, the brakes
          on the car weren't great. She had to
          stop suddenly. She slid on the road,
          she crashed, she died.

                    SETH
          Died instantly?

                    JACOB
          Not quite. She was trapped in the
          wreck for about six hours before she
          passed on.

                    SETH
          Whewww! Those acts of God really stick
          it in and break it off, don't they?

                    JACOB
          Yes, they do.

     Seth looks back at the wallet. He sees Jacob's minister's
     license.

                    SETH
          Is this real?

                    JACOB
          Yes.

                    SETH
          I've seen one of these before. A
          friend of mine had himself declared
          a minister of his own religion. Away
          to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're
          doing, or are you the real McCoy?

                    JACOB
          Real McCoy.

                    SETH
          You're a preacher?

                    JACOB
          I was a minister.

                    SETH
          Was? As in not anymore?

                    JACOB
          Yes.

                    SETH
          Why'd ya quit?

                    JACOB
          I think I've gotten about as up close
          and personal with you as I'm gonna
          get. Now if you need me like I think
          you need me, you're not gonna kill me
          'cause I won't answer your stupid,
          prying questions. So, with all due
          respect, mind your own business.

                    SETH
          I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't
          be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this
          friendly. But you're right, enough
          with the getting to know you shit.
          Now, there's two ways we can play this
          hand. One way is me and you go round
          an' round all fuckin' night. The other
          way, is we reach some sort of an
          understanding. Now, if we go down that
          first path at the end of the day, I'll
          win. But we go down the second, we'll
          both win. Now, I don't give a rat's
          ass about you or your fuckin' family.
          Y'all can live forever or die this
          second and I don't care which. The
          only things I do care about are me
          that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and
          our money. And right now I need to get
          those three things into Mexico. Now,
          stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it
          you don't give a shit about seeing me
          and my brother receiving justice, or
          the bank getting its money back. Right
          now all you care about is the safety
          of your daughter, your son and
          possibly yourself. Am I correct?

                    JACOB
          Yes.

                    SETH
          I thought so. You help us get across
          the border without incident, stay with
          us the rest of the night without
          trying anything funny, and in the
          morning we'll let you and your family
          go. That way everybody gets what they
          want. You and your kids get out of
          this alive and we get into Mexico.
          Everybody's happy.

                    JACOB
          How do I know you'll keep your word?

                    SETH
          Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with
          this shit.

                    JACOB
          You want me to sit here and be
          passive. The only way being passive in
          this situation makes sense is if I
          believe you'll let us go. I'm not
          there yet. You have to convince me
          you're telling the truth.

                    SETH
          Look, dickhead, the only thing you
          need to be convinced about is that
          you're stuck in a situation with a
          coupla real mean motor scooters. I
          don't wanna hafta worry about you all
          fuckin' night. And I don't think you
          wanna be worrying about my brother's
          intentions toward your daughter all
          night. You notice the way he looked
          at her, didn't ya?

                    JACOB
          Yes.

                    SETH
          Didn't like it, did ya?

                    JACOB
          No, I didn't.

                    SETH
          Didn't think so. So, as I was saying,
          I'm willing to make a deal. You
          behave, get us into Mexico, and don't
          try to escape. I'll keep my brother
          off your daughter and let you all
          loose in the morning.

                    JACOB
          You won't let him touch her?

                    SETH
          I can handle Richie, don't worry.

     The two men look at each other for some measure of trust.
     Seth sticks out his hand.

                    SETH
          I give you my word.

     Seth can't help but think about the last time he gave his
     word.

                    SETH
               (hand sticks out)
          My words, my law. Better you not take
          it, and that's just where we are,
          then take it and not mean it.

     Jacob takes his hand, but looks right into Seth.

                    JACOB
          If he touches her, I'll kill him. I
          don't give a fuck how many guns you
          have, nothing will stop me from
          killing him.

                    SETH
          Fair enough. You break your word, I'll
          kill all of you.
               (calling to the back)
          Kate, honey!

                    KATE
          Yeah.

                    SETH
          You must have a bible in here, don't
          cha?

                    KATE
          Yeah, we got a bible.

                    SETH
          Get it and bring it up here, will
          ya, please?

     Kate goes into a drawer, pulls out a bible and brings it up
     front.

                    SETH
          Hold it right there, sweetie pie.
               (to Jacob)
          Put your hand on it.

     Jacob does.

                    SETH
          Swear to God, on the Bible, you won't
          try to escape and you'll get us across
          the border.

                    JACOB
          I swear to God I won't try to escape
          and I'll do my best to get you into
          Mexico.

                    SETH
          You best better get it done, Pops.

     Seth places his hand on the Bible.

                    SETH
          I swear to God I'll let you loose in the
          morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I
          also swear if you do anything to fuck me up,
          I'll slit all your throats.

                                          TIME CUT TO:

          Did ya mean what you said back there?

     Kate turns to him.

                    KATE
          What?

                    RICHARD
          In the room. Were you serious, or were
          you just foolin' around? I'm just
          bringing it up, 'cause if you really
          want me to do that for you, I will.

                    KATE

               (to Seth)
          What?

     Seth and Jacob.

                    SETH
          I told you to watch those kids, I didn't say
          talk to 'em. You guys ain't got nothin' to say
          to one another. So cut the chatter.

     Richard turns to Kate.

                    RICHARD
               (quiet)
          We'll talk later.

     Kate still hasn't a clue what he means.

                                          CUT TO:


     EXT. THE MEXICAN BORDER - NIGHT

     Automobiles are lined up, waiting one by one to go into
     Mexico. Cop cars with their red and blue lights flashing
     are all over the place. Border Patrol men and Police are
     stopping all cars. Pulling up to the end of the line is the
     Fuller's mobile home.


     INT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

     Jacob at the wheel, Seth in the passenger seat. Seth jumps
     up and goes into action.

                    SETH
          Okay everybody, it's show time.
          Richie, take Kate in the bathroom.

     Richard grabs the terrified Kate and drags her in the bathroom,

                    SETH
          Scott, you come up front with your
          daddy.

     Scott does. Seth, keeping low, gets behind Jacob.

                    JACOB
          I'm telling you, don't hurt her.

                    SETH
          As long as you're cool, she'll be
          cool. What're ya gonna say?

                    JACOB
          I don't have the slightest idea.

                    SETH
          Well, you just keep thinkin' of that
          gun next to Kate's temple.

     Seth disappears into the bathroom with Kate and Richard,
     closing the door behind him.

     Father and son are alone for the first time since this whole
     thing began.

                    SCOTT
          What are you gonna do?

                    JACOB
          I'm gonna try and get us across the
          border.

                    SCOTT
          No, dad, you gotta tell 'em that
          they're back there.

     Jacob is surprised to hear Scott say this.


     INT. BATHROOM - MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

     The bathroom, which consists of a shower, a toilet and a
     small sink, is a tight fit with three people in it.

     Richard has his back against the wall, with his arm around
     Kate, holding her in front of him. One hand is over her
     mouth, the other holds a .45 against her head.

     Kate's eyes are wide with fear.

     Seth stands, .45 in hand, ready to fire if the wrong person
     should open the door.

     Everybody talks low and quiet.

                    RICHARD
          This isn't gonna work.

                    SETH
          Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,

                    RICHARD
          I just want to go on record as saying
          this is a bad idea.

                    SETH
          Duly noted. Now, shut up.

     Everyone's quiet for a second, till Richard breaks it.

                    RICHARD
               (to himself)
          They're gonna search the van.

                    SETH
               (offhand)
          As long as you don't act like a
          fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.

                    RICHARD
          What does that mean?

                    SETH
               (distracted)
          What?

     Richard lets Kate go, she quickly moves to the side.

                    RICHARD
          You just called me a fuckin' nut.

                    SETH
          No, I didn't.

                    RICHARD
          Yes, you did. You said as long as I
          don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying
          that I've been acting like a fuckin'
          nut.

                    SETH
          Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay
          cool.

                    RICHARD
          You meant that, but you meant the
          other, too.

     Kate can't believe what she's watching. Neither can Seth.

                    SETH
               (serious as a heart attack)
          This ain't the time, Richard.

                    RICHARD
               (his voice rising)
          Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a
          fuckin' nut, and where I come from,
          that stops the train on its tracks.

                    SETH
               (real quiet and violent)
          Keep your voice down.

                    RICHARD
               (quiet back)
          Or what?

     BACK TO JACOB AND SCOTT          

                    JACOB
          Have you forgotten about your sister?

                    SCOTT
          They're gonna kill us. They get us
          across the border, they're gonna take
          us out in the desert and shoot us.

                    JACOB
          If they get over the border, they're
          gonna let us go.

                    SCOTT
          Dad, I watch those reality shows.
          They never let anybody go. Any cop
          will tell you, in a situation like
          this, you get a chance, you go for it.
          This is our chance.

                    JACOB
          What about Kate?

                    SCOTT
          They're gonna kill her anyway. At
          least now with all these cops we've
          got a fighting chance.

                    JACOB
          Son, I have this situation under
          control. I know exactly what I'm
          doing. You're going to have to trust
          me on this.

                    SCOTT
          If trusting you means trusting those
          fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If
          you don't tell the cops, I will.


     Jacob grabs Scott by the front of his shirt, and yanks him
     to him.

                    JACOB
          Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna
          do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear
          me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm
          running this show, I make the
          decisions.

                    SCOTT
          He's running the show.

                    JACOB
          I'm running the show. I make the
          plays, and you back the plays I
          make. Stop thinking with your fucking
          balls. Kate in a room with a couple of
          desperate men with nothing to fucking
          lose ain't the time to "go for it."
          I need your cover. Cover my ass.

     There's a HONK behind them.

     They both look out the window. It's their turn with the
     BORDER PATROL GUARDS. JACOB takes the wheel and drives up.

     A stern BORDER GUARD approaches JACOB'S window.

                    BORDER GUARD
          How many with you?

                    JACOB
          Just my son and I.

                    BORDER GUARD
          What is your purpose in Mexico?

                    JACOB
          Vacation. I'm taking him to see his
          first bullfight.

     BACK TO BATHROOM

                    RICHARD
          I'm curious. What was the nuttiest
          thing I did?

                    SETH
          This ain't the time.

                    RICHARD
          Oh, I know, was it possibly when your
          ass was rotting in jail and I broke it
          out? Yeah, you're right, that was
          pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention
          stupid. But you know what? I can fix
          that right now.

     SETH HAULS off and PUNCHES Richard smack in the head.
     Richard HITS the floor, Guard, Jacob, and Scott hear
     Richard fall in the bathroom.

                    BORDER GUARD
          What was that?

                    JACOB
          Oh, that's just my daughter in the
          bathroom.

                    BORDER GUARD
          You said it was just you and your son.

                    JACOB
          I meant me, my son and my daughter.

     CLOSE-UP BORDER GUARD

                    BORDER GUARD
          Open the door. I'm coming aboard.

     BACK TO BATHROOM

     CLOSE-UP KATE

     We can only see Kate's face. It's scared. We hear rustling
     around the bathroom, but we don't know what it is.

     Then it's quiet. Then we hear talking outside the door, but
     we can't make it out. Then we hear a knock.

                    KATE
          I'm in the bathroom.

                    BORDER GUARD (O.S.)
          It's the Border Patrol. Open up.

                    KATE
          It's open.

     We hear the door open and see the light change on Kate's
     face. She's looking up.

     BORDER GUARD in the doorway looking in.

     HE SEES: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles, sitting
     on the toilet.

                    KATE
          Do you mind? Shut the fucking door.

                    BORDER GUARD
          Excuse me.

     He closes the door. Kate lets out a breath. We wait a beat,
     Seth pulls back the curtain in the shower, we see Richie on
     the floor of the shower knocked out.

     Seth and Kate meet eyes.

     He gives her the O.K. signal.

                                          CUT TO:

     BACK WINDOW MOTOR HOME

     We see through the back window of the motor home, the border
     getting smaller as we drive away from it.

     Scott knocks on the bathroom door.

                    SCOTT
          It's clear.

     Seth BURSTS out of the bathroom.

                    SETH
          Goddamn, that was. intense!

     Seth goes to the back window. He sees the border getting
     farther and farther away. No cars following.

                    SETH
               (to himself)
          We did it.
               (pause)
          We're in Mexico.

     Seth throws his head back and SCREAMS for joy.

     Kate, emerging from the bathroom, reacts to Seth's scream,
     along with Scott.

     Seth is so happy that he does a little jig in the back of
     the van.

     Everybody else is still tense as shit. But Seth lets go of
     all his tension, and becomes a new man before our eyes. He
     turns to Kate.

                    SETH
               (loud and happy)
          Come here, Kate!

     Kate, nervous, takes a step back.

     He charges for her. GRABS her, hugs her around her waist,
     and spins her around. When he lets her go, she stumbles
     dizzily onto the bed.

                    SETH
               (to Kate)
          You were magnificent! You told him to
          shut the fucking door. I'm hiding in
          the shower, and I'm thinking to
          myself, "Did I just fuckin' hear what
          I just fuckin' heard? And what does he
          do -- he shuts the fucking door!

     Kate kind of half smiles.

                    SETH
          If I was a bit younger, baby, I'd
          fuckin' marry you!

     Seth goes up front and slaps Jacob on the back.

                    SETH
          I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you
          raised a fuckin' woman.

     Jacob doesn't share Seth's enthusiasm, but he is relieved.

                    JACOB
          We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico.
          Now it's time for your part, letting
          us go.

                    SETH
          Pops, when you're right, you're right,
          and you are right.

                    KATE
               (suddenly brightens)
          You're gonna let us go?

                    SETH
          In the morning, darlin', in the
          morning, we are G-O-N-E and you are
          F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys
          through hell, and I know I've been one
          rough pecker, but from here on end you
          guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help
          me pick Richie up, and lay him down.
          Jacob, keep going on this road till
          you get to a sign that says, "Digayo."
          When you get to Digayo, turn this big
          bastard left, go on down for a few
          miles, then you see a bar called "The
          Titty Twister." From what I hear, you
          can't miss it.

                    JACOB
          Then?

                    SETH
          Then stop, 'cause that's where we're
          going.

     He slaps him once again on the back, and leaves to attend
     to Richard.

                                          CUT TO:

     CLOSE-UP RICHARD without glasses. Unconscious, Seth slaps
     his face.

                    SETH (O.S.)
           C'mon, kid, wake up. Don't make a
           career out of it.

     Richard starts coming to and opens his eyes. Seth sits at the
     foot of the bed.

                    SETH
          You okay?

                    RICHARD
               (disoriented)
          Yeah, I think so. What happened?

                    SETH
          I don't know, you just passed out.

                    RICHARD
          I did?

                    SETH
          Yeah, we were just standing there. You
          said something about your shoulder
          hurting, then you just hit the ground
          like a sack of potatoes.

                    RICHARD
          Really?

                    SETH
          Yeah, when you fell your head smacked
          the toilet hard. It scared the shit
          outta me. Sure you're okay?

                    RICHARD
          Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little
          fucked up.

                    SETH
          Well, let me tell ya something, gonna
          clear your head right up. We are
          officially Mexicans.

                    RICHARD
          What?

                    SETH
          We are...
               (singing)
          "South of the border down Mexico way."

                    RICHARD
          We are?

                    SETH
          Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous
          right now. We get there, we pound
          booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts
          us to El Ray. And then me and you,
          brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya
          like them apples?

     Slowly shaking the cobwebs out of his head.

                    RICHARD
          Far out.
               (pause)
          Where are my glasses?

                    SETH
          They broke when you fell.

                    RICHARD
          Oh, fuck, Seth, that's my only pair!

                    SETH
          Don't worry about it, we'll get you
          some glasses.

                    RICHARD
          What dya mean, don't worry about it.
          Of course I'm gonna worry about it,
          I can't fuckin' see.

                    SETH
          When we get to El Ray, I'll take care
          of it.

                    RICHARD
          Yeah, like a Mexican
          hole-in-the-wall's gonna have my
          fuckin' prescription.

                    SETH
          It's not a big deal, unless you make
          it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy,
          Richie, stop bringing me down with
          bullshit.

     Jacob calls to the back.

                    JACOB
          Guys! We're here.

                                          CUT TO:

     A neon sign that flashes:

          THE TITTY TWISTER
           Hiker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn

     Underneath the joint's proud name on the sign, and
     on top of "Biker/Trucker bar, Dusk till Dawn" is a
     well-endowed woman, whose breast is being twisted
     by a neon hand.


     EXT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT
     The neon sign sits on top of the rudest, sleaziest, most
     crab-infested, strip joint, honky-tonk whorehouse in all of
     Mexico.

     The Titty Twister is located out in the middle of
     nowheres ville. It sits by itself with nothing around it for
     miles. A plethora of choppers and eighteen wheelers are
     parked out in front. The walls almost pulsate from the LOUD,
     RAUNCHY MUSIC within the structure. Signs cover the walls
     outside reading things like: 

     "NUDE DANCING", "WHORES", "BEER", "AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD",
     "BIKERS AND TRUCKERS ONLY", "OPEN DUSK TILL DAWN",
     "THURSDAY COCKFIGHT NIGHT", "WEDNESDAY DOGFIGHT NIGHT",
     "DONKEY SHOW MONDAYS", "EVERY FRIDAY BARE KNUCKLE FIGHT TO
     THE DEATH, FEATURING THE LOVELY SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM",
     "ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY", and "THE SLEAZY TITTY
     TWISTER DANCERS."

     In the parking lot, a BIKER and a TRUCK DRIVER beat the shit
     out of each other, one with a pipe, the other with a hammer.
     A SECOND BIKER fucks a Titty Twister WHORE against the wall.
     A greasy man, known as CHET PUSSY, stands in the parking
     lot, soliciting customers through a Mr. Microphone.

                    CHET
          Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must
          go. At the Titty Twister we're
          slashing pussy in half! This is a
          pussy blow out! Make us an offer on our
          vast selection of pussy! We got white
          pussy, black pussy, Spanish pussy,
          yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold pussy,

          smelly pussy, velvet pussy, silk

          pussy, horse pussy, dog pussy, mule
          pussy, fake pussy! If we don't have
          it, you don't want it!

     The Fullers' recreational vehicle pulls into the parking
     lot and stops.


     INT. MOTOR HOME - NIGHT

     What's left of the Fuller family and the Gecko family look
     out the windshield onto the sight that is the Titty Twister.

                    SETH
               (to the group)
          Okay, troops, this is the homestretch.
          Here's the deal; this place closes at
          dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us here
          sometime before dawn. Which by my
          guesstimate is somewhere between three
          or four hours from now. So we're gonna
          go in there, take a seat, have a drink
          -- have a bunch of drinks, and wait
          for Carlos. That could be an hour,
          that could be three hours, I don't
          know which. But when he gets here,
          me and Richie are going to leave
          with him. After we split, you guys
          are officially out of this stewpot.
          Let me just say I'm real happy about
          where we're at. We got a real nice, "I
          don't fuck with you -- you don't fuck
          with me" attitude going on. Now, if
          everybody just keeps playin' it cool
          -- and I'm talking to you, too, Richie
          -- everybody's gonna get what they
          want. Comprende, amigos?

     Everybody nods and mutters in agreement.

                    SETH
          Okay hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
          I'm buyin'.


     EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
     The camper door FLIES OPEN and the two brothers and the
     Fuller family step out into the night.

     They look across the parking lot at the Titty Twister.
     It literally looks in some ways like the entrance to hell.

                    JACOB
          Out of the stew pot and into the fire.

                    SETH
          Shit, I been to bars make this place
          look like a fuckin' 4-H club.

                    RICHARD
          I gotta say I'm with Jacob on this. I
          been to some fucked up places in my
          time, but that place is fucked up.

     Seth can't believe it.

                    SETH
               (in a baby talk voice)
          Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little
          baby too afraid to go into the big
          scary bar?

     The two brothers square off, not like strangers fighting,
     but like brothers fight. They talk real quiet, but real
     personal.

                    RICHARD
          That's what you think?

                    SETH
          That's how you're lookin', Richie.

                    RICHARD
          I'm lookin' scared?

                    SETH
          That's what you look like.

                    RICHARD
          You know what you look like?

                    SETH
          No, Richie, what do I look like?

                    RICHARD
          You're lookin' green.

     That's not what Seth expected to hear.

                    SETH
          How?

                    RICHARD
          Where are you right now?

                    SETH
          What do you mean?

                    RICHARD
          Where are you?

                    SETH
          I'm here with you.

                    RICHARD
          No, you're not. You're sippin'
          margaritas in El Ray. But we're
          not in El Ray. We're here --
          getting ready to go in there.
          You're so pleased with yourself
          about getting into Mexico, you
          think the job's down. It ain't.
          Get back on the clock. That's a
          fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around
          there for a coupla hours, in all
          likelihood, we'll get fucked with.
          So get your shit together, brother.

                    SETH
          My shit is together.

                    RICHARD
          It don't look together.

                    SETH
          Well, it is. Just because I'm happy
          doesn't mean I'm on vacation. You're
          just not used to seein' me happy,
          'cause it's been about fifteen fuckin'
          years since I been happy. But my shit
          is forever together.

     Richard believes Seth's response.

                    RICHARD
          Okay, just checkin'.

     They walk toward the bar's entrance. Chet Pussy talks into
     the microphone.

                    CHET
               (yelling into the microphone)
          Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.
          Buy any piece of pussy a tour regular
          price, you get another piece of pussy,
          of equal or lesser value, for a penny.
          Now try and beat pussy for a penny!
          If you can find cheaper pussy
          anywhere, fuck it!

     Chet notices our heroes, especially young Kate.

                    CHET
               (in microphone, towards Kate)
          What's this? A new flavor approaching.
          Apple Pie Pussy.

                    SETH
          Step aside, asshole.

     Chet POKES HIS FINGER in Seth's CHEST.

                    CHET
          Not so fast, Slick.

     Seth GRABS HOLD of Chet's FINGER, BENDS it BACKWARDS till
     the BONE SNAPS in two.

     Chet lets out a SCREAM.

     Seth VIOLENTLY brings his HEAD FORWARD PULVERIZING Chet's
     NOSE.

     Chet FALLS to his KNEES in front of Seth.

     Seth HOOKS him with a powerful FIST UNDER his CHIN that
     SNAPS Chet's HEAD BACK, and THROWS him on his BACK.

     After HITTING the GROUND, Seth SENDS a SAVAGE KICK straight
     to Chet's FACE, ROLLING HIM OVER.

     Chet is OUT.

     The whole altercation took two seconds.

     Everyone's in shock and looks at Seth. Seth looks back at
     everyone.

                    SETH
          Now, is my shit together, or is my
          shit together?

     Richard and Seth laugh with each other.

                    RICHARD
               (slappin' Seth five)
          Your shit is forever together!

     They head for the door. Richard stays behind for a second,
     and gives the fallen Chet a few, swift kicks,


     INT. THE TITTY TWISTER NIGHT

     If the Titty Twister looked like the asshole of the world
     from the outside, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, "You
     ain't seen nothin' yet." This is the kind of place where
     they sweep up the teeth and hose down the cum, the blood
     and the beer at closing.

     In the back, TOPLESS DANCERS do lap dances with customers,
     while a SLEAZY SEXY STRIPPER STRIPS to RAUNCHY MUSIC, played
     at ear drum-bursting level. TWO MEN are in a savage
     BAREKNUCKLE FIGHT, surrounded by screaming customers of
     bikers and truckers.

     One of the dancers is a man with a saddle on his back, his
     name is DANNY THE WONDER PONY. The woman on his back, in
     the saddle, feet in the stirrups, hands on the reins, is
     ATHENA, his rider. They dance around to the cheers of the
     crowd.

     Bikers and truckers play pool in the back. Fights break out
     here about one every ten minutes. The customers may start 'em,
     but the bouncer, BIG EMILIO, ends 'em.

     Seth, Richard, Jacob, Scott and Kate walk through the door.
     They each individually take in the sights and the smells.
     Seth is the first to say something.

                    SETH
          Now this is my kinda place! I could
          become a regular.

     The man behind the bar is RAZOR CHARLIE. He eyes the group
     as they approach.

     Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who
     populate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing
     look across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies
     up to the bar.

                    SETH
          Whiskey!

                    RAZOR CHARLIE
               (in English)
          You can't come in here.

                    SETH
          What dya mean?

                    RAZOR CHARLIE
          This is a private club. You're not
          welcome.

                    SETH
          Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough
          to drink here?

                    RAZOR CHARLIE
          This bar is for bikers and truckers
          only.
               (points his finger to Seth)
          You, get out!

     Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places 
     HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder.

                    BIG EMILIO
               (to Seth in Spanish)
          Walk, Pendaho.

     Seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder.

                    SETH
               (low)
          Take your hand off me.

                    BIG EMILIO
               (Spanish)
          I'm going to count to three.

                    SETH
          No, I'm going to count to three.

                    BIG EMILIO
          Uno...

                    SETH
          Two..

     Jacob jumps in the middle.

                    JACOB
          Now wait a minute, there's no reason
          to get ugly. There's just a
          misunderstanding going on here. You
          said this bar is for truckers and
          bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver.

     Everybody looks at Jacob.

     As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet.

                    JACOB
          If you look outside your door, parked
          in your parking lot, you'll see a big
          ass recreational vehicle. That's mine.
          In order to drive that legally, you
          need a class two driver's license.
          That is the same license that the
          DMV requires truck drivers to carry
          in order to drive a truck.
               (he takes the license out
                of his wallet and lays it
                on the bar)
          That is me, and this is my class two
          license. This is a truck driver's bar,
          I am a truck driver, and these are
          my friends.

     Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech.

     Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at
     everyone in the party and smiles.

                    RAZOR CHARLIE
               (to Jacob)
          Welcome to the Titty Twister. What
          can I get you?

     Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw.

                    SETH
          Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.

     Razor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big
     smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth.
     But instead he just says,

                    RAZOR CHARLIE
          Coming right up.

     Razor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the
     party one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a
     buddy punch on the shoulder.

                    RICHARD
          Good job, Pops.

     Seth's still frying an egg on his head.

                    SETH
          That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest
          number one problem with Mexico, it's
          not service oriented. I was feelin'
          so good, and those fuckin' spies
          brought me down.

     Richard puts his arm around Seth.

                    RICHARD
          Fuck 'em, shake it off.

     Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks
     at the guy, still pissed.

                    SETH
          You serve food, Jose?

     Razor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur,
     but he just smiles and says,

                    RAZOR CHARLIE
          Best in Mexico.

                    SETH
          I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a
          table, send over a waitress to take
          our order.

     Seth walks away, and the group follows him.

     We just hang on the evil wheels turning inside of Razor
     Charlie's head.

     The five of them move across the floor to a table. As they
     walk, Kate attracts stares, wolf whistles and rude comments
     from some of the patrons. Jacob keeps near his daughter.

     The dancers do their sexy routines. A big-chested,
     wild-haired blonde catches Scott's eye. She winks at him.

     Richard leans over and whispers in Scott's ear.

                    RICHARD
          Anytime you want a lap dance with that
          broad, say the word. It's on me, kiddo.

     He gives the boy's neck a squeeze. Jacob's eyes survey the
     surroundings. Big Emilio and Razor Charlie quietly exchange
     words about the party in Spanish.

                    RAZOR CHARLIE
               (in Spanish)
          They're not the normal road trash we
          normally feed on. But it'll be okay.
          No one knows they're here.

     The five of them find a table and sit down.

     Seth, still in a bad mood, takes the cork out of the whiskey
     bottle and tosses it. He pours Richie and himself a glass.

                    SETH
          Who else?

                    JACOB
          Pass.

                    SETH
               (picking a fight)
          Why not, against your religion?

                    JACOB
               (won't be baited)
          No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking
          now.

                    SETH
          Suit yourself, more for me.
               (to Scott)
          Scotty?

     Scott shakes his head no.

                    SETH
               (to Kate)
          How 'bout you?
               (pointing at Scott and Kate)
          are safer in here with us than
          wandering around a Mexican border town
          all night long. Just don't do nothin'
          stupid and we'll all get along fine.
               (to Scott)
          Scotty, you sure you don't want a
          drink?

                    SCOTT
          Okay, I'll have one.

                    JACOB
          No you won't.

     Seth pours Scott a shot.

                    SETH
          Sorry, Pops, but I'm drinkin' and I
          don't like drinkin' alone. Bottoms
          up, boy.

     Scott takes the drink and he, too, experiences an
     on-drinker's tremor.

     Seth turns to Kate.

                    SETH
          How about you, cutie pie? Ready for
          round two?

                    KATE
          Okay.

     Seth just passes her the bottle. She pours her own shot and
     knocks it back.

                    RICHARD
               (to Seth)
          Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you
          just created a monster.

     Jacob turns to Seth and asks quietly.

                    JACOB
          Why are you so agitated?

                    SETH
          I'm still stewing about that ape
          laying hands on me. And that fuckin'
          bartender sticks a weed up my ass,
          too.

                    JACOB
          He backed down.

                    SETH
          He's smilin' at us. But behind his
          smile, he's sayin', "Fuck you Jack."
          I hear that loud and clear.

                    JACOB
          What are you going to do?

                    SETH
               (picking up the whiskey bottle)
          I'm gonna just sit here and drain
          this bottle. And when I've drunk the
          last drop, if I still feel then, the
          way I feel now, I'm gonna take this
          bottle and break it over his melon
          head.

                    JACOB
          Before we stepped in here, you told
          all of us to be cool. That means you,
          too.

                    SETH
               (tossing it off)
          I never said do what I do, I said do
          what I say.

                    JACOB
          Are you so much a fucking loser, you
          can't tell when you've won?

     Richard, Kate and Scott both turn to Jacob. Nobody can
     believe what he just said. Neither can Seth who calmly lays
     down his drinking glass.

                    SETH
          What did you call me?

                    JACOB
          Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I
          asked a question. Would you like me to
          ask it again? Very well. Are you such
          a loser you can't tell when you've
          won?
               (pause)
          The entire state of Texas, along with
          the FBI, is looking for you. Did they
          find you? No. They couldn't. They had
          every entrance to the border covered.
          There's no way you could get across.
          Did you? Yes, you did. You've won,
          Seth, enjoy it.

     Seth looks at Jacob, then picks up the bottle.

                    SETH
          Jacob, I want you to have a drink with
          me. I insist.

     Jacob slides his empty glass over to Seth. Seth pours booze
     in Jacob's glass and his own. Both men pick up the glasses.

                    SETH
          To your family.

                    JACOB
          To yours.

     They both knock 'em back and slap the empty glasses down.

                    JACOB
          Now, is your shit together?

                    SETH
          Forever together.

     Seth turns to Scott.

                    SETH
          In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take
          it that's yours.

                    SCOTT
          Yeah, it's mine.

                    SETH
          Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming on.

                                          CUT TO:

     Seth sitting at the table, playing guitar, singing Mexican
     songs. Some bikers, truckers, and whores have gathered
     around their table. Everyone's groovin'. Seth finishes the
     song. Everybody applauds.

     Razor Charlie behind the bar grabs the greasy microphone
     that he uses to announce dancers.

                    RAZOR CHARLIE
               (announcer voice in Spanish)
          And now for your viewing pleasure. The
          Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome
          of Evil. The most sinister woman to
          dance on the face of the earth. Lowly
          dogs, get on your knees, bow your
          heads and worship at the feet of
          SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM!

     The lights go down low. A light hits the stage. The opening
     notes of the Coaster's "Down in Mexico" fills the room.

     The crowd hushes up.

     And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.

     This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that
     Stendhal described in "As the Promise of Happiness," but
     the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.

     She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the
     stage, but like she owned the world.

     And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the
     world is proud to be her possession.

     All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the
     Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially
     Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and
     accompanies from the table with the guitar.

     When the music builds to its explosive section.

     Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the
     room.

     She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
     the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up
     looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie
     and points at Seth's table, describing what happened.

     As the last verse plays, Santanico, like a snake, comes up
     from the ground, on top of the Fuller/Gecko table.

     Richard, Kate and Scott are enraptured.

     Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.
     She STANDS OVER him.

     While moving her body to the music, she lifts up the whisky
     bottle from the table, and pours the whiskey down her leg.

     She lifts up her foot, with the whiskey dripping from her
     toes, and sticks it in Richard's face.

                    SANTANICO
               (to Richard in Spanish)
          Drink up.

     Richie, mesmerized, sucks the whiskey off her toes. The
     CROWD GOES WILD. Santanico smiles, master of all she
     surveys.

     Jacob and Scott are embarrassed.

     Kate, oddly enough, is turned on by the controlling power
     this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.

     Seth laughs out loud a Mexican "yi yi yiii" laugh, keeping
     the beat with his guitar.

     Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions
     over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what
     Seth and company did to Chet.

     Richard continues to suck her toes.

     The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's
     mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks
     down at the seated Richard.

     She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His
     mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE
     OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey
     from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd
     applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob
     and Richard, both for their own reasons, the table applauds,
     none louder than Seth.

                    SETH
          Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that's what
          I call a fuckin' show!

     One of Santanico's FLUNKIES brings the naked woman a robe,
     which she puts on.

     Richard, still in a daze, looks up at his new friend.

                    SETH
               (snapping his fingers)
          Earth to Richie. Don't you wanna ask
          your new friend to join us?

                    RICHARD
          Yeah.

                    SETH
          Well, then ask her, dumb ass.

                    RICHARD
               (looking up at Santanico)
          Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to
          join us?

                    SANTANICO
               (to Richard)
          Muy bien, gracias.

     Santanico sits down next to Richie. Seth pours her a drink.

                    SETH
          Richie, you lucky bastard!
               (to Santanico)
          Now, little lady, you could of just as
          easily done that to me. Who a Nelly!
          You got my dick harder 'n Chinese
          arithmetic.

     The table laughs.

                    SETH
          Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red
          Riding Hood is walking through the
          forest and she comes across Little Bo
          Peep, and Little Bo Peep says:
          "Little Red Riding Hood, are you
          crazy? Don't you know the Big Bad Wolf
          is walking these woods and if he finds
          you he's gonna pull down your dress
          and squeeze your titties?" Then Little
          Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt
          and taps a .357 Magnum she has
          holstered on her thigh and says: "No
          he won't."

     As Seth tells his joke, Jacob notices Razor Charlie, Big
     Emilio and Chet moving rapidly towards their table.

                    JACOB
               (to himself)
          Oh, shit.
               (to Seth)
          Seth --

     Seth waves him away.

                    SETH
          Not now. So finally she comes across
          the Big Bad Wolf and the Big Bad
          Wolf's laughing and says: "Little Red
          Riding Hood, you know better than to
          be walking around these woods alone.
          You know I'm just gonna have to pull
          down your dress and squeeze your
          titties." Then Little Red Riding Hood
          whips out her .357, cocks it, sticks
          it in the Big Bad Wolf's face and
          says: "No you won't. You're gonna eat
          me, just like the story says."

     Seth starts laughing at his own joke uproariously. Richard,
     Kate, Scott and Santanico join in too. Before Jacob can say
     anything --

     The Titty Twister trio stand over the table.

                    RAZOR CHARLIE
               (to Chet in Spanish)
          Which one?

                    CHET
               (pointing at Seth)
          This piece of shit broke my finger
          and my nose...
               (pointing at Richard)
          then this fag kicked me in the ribs
          while I was down.

     That's all Big Emilio has to hear.

                    BIG EMILIO
               (to The Gecko Brothers)
          Up!

                    RICHARD
          Fuck off, ape man!

     Big Emilio leans in with his beefy hand, GRABS Richard by
     the shoulder. Richard lets out a howl as blood pours from
     his wounded shoulder.

     Santanico steps back from the table.

     Seth jumps to his feet and FIRES a round from his .45 into
     Big Emilio, sending his bullet-ridden body to the floor.
     Razor Charlie whips out a straight version of his name sake
     and SLASHES Seth across the face.

     Seth SCREAMS at the top of his lungs as his hand goes up to
     his laid open cheek.

     Richard, who has fallen to the ground holding his wound,
     brings up his .45 and starts BLASTING.

     Razor Charlie takes a bullet in the head, chest and belly
     before he hits the floor.

     Jacob and his children have hit the floor as well to stay
     out of gunfire.

     The bikers, truckers, waitresses and whores all stop what
     they were doing.

     The music continues to play, though the dancers stop
     dancing.

     Santanico, who's closest to the two brothers, smells
     something.

     Her NOSTRILS FLARE.

     Richard moves to his brother, who takes out a handkerchief
     and puts it to his face.

                    RICHARD
          How are you?

                    SETH
          Scarred for life, that's how I am!

     Seth looks up and sees Chet still standing there.

                    SETH
          You thought it was pretty funny,
          didn't you?

     Both brothers FIRE on Chet. Chet's blown left... right...
     left... right... then drops, pointing their guns towards
     the crowd.

                    SETH
          Everybody be cool, or you'll be just
          as dead as these fucks!

     SLOW MOTION: Blood drips down the side of Seth's face.

     SLOW MOTION: It splatters to the floor.

     The CAMERA scans the crowd. The patrons are scared, but the
     waitresses, whores and dancers lick their lips.

     SLOW MOTION: Blood drips from Richard's shoulder. It falls
     to the floor, splattering.

     WE MOVE INTO SANTANICO'S FACE. A special aroma fills
     her nostrils. Her eyes lock on Richard. The look on her face
     could easily be read as intense sexual desire.

     CLOSE-UP KATE ON FLOOR

     Looks up and watches, eyes wide with fear, Santanico's
     transformation.

     Her NOSE RECEDES INTO her face like a rodent's. The whites
     of her eyes turn YELLOW. The FANGS of a beast PROTRUDE from
     her mouth. Kate yells from the floor.

                    KATE
               (yelling)
          Richie, look out!

     Before Richie can turn around.

     SANTANICO LEAPS ACROSS THE FLOOR, LANDS on his BACK and
     SINKS her FANGS into Richie's wounded SHOULDER.

     Richard LETS LOOSE with an agonizing SCREAM.

     Seth turns to his brother's cry.

     He sees SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM, like a mongoose attached to
     a cobra, legs wrapped around Richard's waist, fangs buried
     deep in his shoulder, and Richard screaming and slamming
     about, trying to knock her off.

     Richard screams to Seth:

                    RICHARD
          Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!

     Seth tries to aim his gun, but there's too much movement. He
     can't get a clear shot.

     Jacob and his children can't believe what they're seeing.

     Richard can't take it anymore, his knees buckle. Santanico
     rides him down to the floor.

     Seth gets a clear shot, he takes aim and FIRES, hitting the
     vamp in the head, blowing her off his brother.

     Richard, who's on all fours, tries to stand and gets about
     half way before he stops, saying:

                    RICHARD
               (with his dying breath)
          Fucking Bitch!

     He tumbles over, a corpse.

                    SETH
          Richie.

     Suddenly, the eyes of Big Emilio, Razor Charlie and Chet
     Pussy pop open. The "dead" men sit up with evil grins on
     their faces.

     The patrons scream.

     A WHORE locks the front door (which is a complicated lock
     with steel rods going into the ground), turns toward the bar
     and yells:

                    WHORE
          Dinner is served!

     The bikers and truckers who have been transfixed, watching
     the impossible, realize that the waitresses, naked dancers
     and whores who they were pawing just five minutes ago, have
     turned into yellow-eyed, razor-fanged, drool-dripping
     VAMPIRES.

     The vamps attack.

     What follows is a shark feeding frenzy. Whores, who had been
     sitting on customer's laps, sink their teeth into unshaven
     necks.

     Naked strippers and bikers wail the shit out of each other.
     Truckers get their heads caved in by women half their size.
     The patrons use what ever they can find to fend off the
     monsters: chairs, chair legs, broken bottles, switchblades,
     anything.

     Jacob, Kate and Scott make a dash and dive behind the bar.
     They hide and watch.

     Seth stands where his was, limp dick of a .45 in his hand,
     too freaked, scared and stunned to do anything. He stands
     motionless, watching what he can't believe.

     Behind him, Santanico, who lies next to the dead Richard,
     eyes POP OPEN.

     She RISES in her snake/dance way.

     Seth feels her and SPINS in her direction, gun raised.

                    SANTANICO
          Let's see if you taste as good as your
          brother.

     She approaches Seth, who FIRES at her. BAM... BAM... BAM...
     CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. She laughs and gives her
     hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.

     Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
     JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the
     FLOOR and INTO the WALL.

     A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the
     side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a
     pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.

     Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a
     switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the
     bar to the other.

     The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,
     goes head to head with a stripper.

     The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has
     close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the
     vamp bitch blow for blow.

     Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head
     and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her
     on the wooden leg.

     FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie
     appears, straight razor in hand.

     Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor
     Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool
     cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie
     UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.
     Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of
     the cue in Razor Charlie's heart.

     Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the
     vampire's death scream.

     Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He
     tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his
     chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but
     the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block
     placed on his chest.

                    SANTANICO
          I'm not gonna drain you completely.
          You're gonna turn for me, You'll be
          my slave. You'll live for me. You'll
          eat bugs because I order it. Because
          I don't think you're worthy of human
          blood, you'll feed on the blood of
          stray dogs. You'll be my foot stool.
          And at my command, you'll lick the dog
          shit from my boot heel. Since you'll
          be my dog, your new name will be
          "Spot". Welcome to slavery.

     SLOW MOTION: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR, sailing
           end over end.

     CLOSE-UP SANTANICO

     looking down at Seth, her face contorts to FEED MODE, when
     the bottle HITS her SQUARE in the HEAD, SHATTERING.

     We see that Jacob behind the bar threw it.

     Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is
     momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.

     Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.

     Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes
     the liquor-soaked robe ignite.

     Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.

     Big Emilio sees Santanico's fiery death. He lets out a cry.

                    BIG EMILIO
          Noooooo!

     He turns his hateful gaze on the two humans.

     Seth and Jacob see Big Emilio zeroing in on them, then they
     see him move his big frame in their direction. Seth turns to
     Jacob.

                    SETH
          We may be in trouble.

     Big Emilio walks steadily through the bar like Godzilla
     walks through Tokyo. Tipping over tables, knocking fighting
     vamps and humans alike on their asses on his way to stamp
     out Seth and Jacob. A TRUCKER JUMPS in his path to attack
     him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed
     aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.

     Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
     Seth and Jacob.

     Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a
     weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.

     Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their
     wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him
     look like a huge walking shark.

     Just when Big Emilio's ready to strike, he hears behind him,

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey, you, monkey man!

     Big Emilio turns and sees Sex Machine across the room.

                    SEX MACHINE
          Anything you gotta say to them, say
          to me first.

     Both Seth and Jacob ATTACK Big Emilio from behind. He
     effortlessly knocks them away.

     They both hit the ground.

     Sex Machine gestures with his hand to Big Emilio to "come
     ahead."

     Big Emilio CHARGES towards Sex Machine, like a runaway
     locomotive.

     Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two
     huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the
     Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
     buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,
     who HITS the floor.

     Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,
     BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The
     vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the
     savage beating.

                    SEX MACHINE
          That's enough.

     Jacob and Seth stop.

     Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the
     end tip, making it jagged, and like a spear, STICKS it into
     big vamp's fallen body. Big Emilio, SCREAMS, TWITCHES and
     dies. The pool cue sticks out straight up from the dead
     vamp.

     Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He
     breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from
     around his mouth.

     Kate and Scott are cowering behind the bar when Chet appears
     over the top. They both let out a scream. Scott goes to
     protect his sister and receives a punch in the face for his
     trouble. Chet dives at Kate.

                    CHET
          You know what everybody says about me?
          I suck!

     Chet goes to bite Kate, grabbing at her t-shirt, and sees
     her crucifix. HE recoils backwards. Scott grabs hold of
     his head from behind. Kate jumps up from the floor, rips
     off her cross and grabs Chet by his beatnik beard, opening
     his mouth. She SHOVES the cross inside. Chet's eyes roll
     up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.

     GULP.

     Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard
     moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his
     mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He
     jumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain.
     He jumps from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, screaming
     all the while.

     Kate and Scott watch him from the bar, mischievous grins on
     their faces.

     Chet is on his knees, arms stretched out, yelling at the top
     of his lungs like a vamp King Lear.

                    CHET
          I-AM-IN-AGONNNYYYY!

     Chet breaks off a chair leg, muttering to himself.

                    CHET
          Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the
          pain, stop the pain, stop the pain...

     He plunges the stake into his own heart, but instead of the
     vampire's cry that escapes from the others upon being
     staked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.

     By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the
     vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
     customers have been butchered or drained.

     All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
     and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his
     kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who
     are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding
     wooden stakes.

     The four human men group together. The four female vampires
     charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.
     Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
     slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four
     staked bodies hit the floor.

     Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's
     side.

     They all stand looking at the horrible carnage that has
     taken place. The floor is littered with dead bodies.

                    FROST
          Ain't they supposed to burn up or
          something?

     At that moment a bright flash ERUPTS, illuminating
     everyone's face. The sound of quick burning flames fills
     the air. Everybody shields their eyes from the intense
     light, which lasts only a split second.

     It vanishes, along with the bodies of the vampires. All
     that remains is a smoldering mess of goo where the bodies
     once lay.

     They all stare at the mess for a few seconds and then RUN
     for the door. It's locked. They BANG on the door, but it's
     useless. It ain't budging, yet they all go on banging.

     Except for Seth. He never ran for the door. He walks over
     to his dead brother's body and kneels beside it.

     He takes his dead hand.

                    SETH
          Richie, I'm sorry I fucked things up.
          You'd really like it in El Ray. We'd
          find peace there. I love you little
          brother, I'll miss ya bad.

     Seth goes to kiss his brother's lips when, RICHARD 'S EYES
     POP OPEN. They're YELLOW. Seth RAISES his head in surprise.

                    RICHARD
          I'm glad you feel that way, Seth. I
          love you, too.

     Richard GRABS Seth by the front of his shirt and pulls him
     down to him. Fangs are now exposed. Seth tries to pull away.
     He SCREAMS for the others to help. Richard PULLS Seth down
     to striking distance and opens his mouth to take the big
     bite, when Sex Machine grabs Seth from behind and YANKS him
     from Richard's grasp. Jacob, Frost and the kids have
     surrounded Richard and proceed to KICK him and STOMP his
     head. Sex Machine picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a
     wall. He picks up one of the chair legs and walks over to
     where the others are holding Richard down. Richard sees the
     wood in the biker's hand. He knows what that means. Seth
     whips out his .45 and points it at Sex Machine.

                    SETH
          Touch my brother with that stake,
          biker, and vampires won't need to
          suck your blood, they'll be able to
          lick it up off the floor.

                    SEX MACHINE
          He ain't your brother no more.

                    SETH
          That's a matter of opinion, and I
          don't give a fuck about your's.

     Jacob, Frost and the kids continue to hold Richard down to
     the ground.

                    JACOB
          Don't be an idiot, he'll kill us all!

     Seth aims his gun at the group.

                    SETH
          Shut up!

     Richard's giggling.

                    RICHARD
          Yeah, shut up.

     Seth, still holding the outstretched gun, takes the stake
     out of Sex Machine's hand. Seth lowers the .45.

                    SETH
          Hold him down.

     The smile evaporates from Richard's face.

                    SETH
          Richie, here's the peace in death I
          could never give you in life.

     Seth puts the stake over Richard's heart. Using the butt of
     his .45 like a hammer, he POUNDS the stake into Richard's
     heart. Richard screams and dies. They all stand around the
     body as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES and disintegrates into goo.
     Seth breaks away from the group and walks over to the bar.
     He grabs a bottle of whiskey and starts downing it. Kate,
     of all people, walks away from the group and joins Seth at
     the bar.

                    KATE
          Are you okay?

                    SETH
          Peachy! Why shouldn't I be? The
          world's my oyster, except for the
          fact that I just rammed a wooden
          stake in my brother's heart because
          he turned into a vampire, even
          though I don't believe in vampires.
          Aside from that unfortunate business,
          everything's hunky-dory.

                    KATE
          I'm really sorry.

                    SETH
          Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half
          a chance you'd feed us to them!

                    JACOB
          Then why didn't I?

     Jacob walks over to Seth.

                    JACOB
          I saved your life. I didn't have to,
          but I did. And I'm sorry you lost your
          brother. I'm sorry he's dead. I'm
          sorry everybody's dead. Now, if we're
          gonna get out of this we need each
          other. And we need you sober and
          thinking, not drunk and...

     As Jacob has been talking, a sound has started that has
     grown LOUDER and LOUDER. Jacob stops in mid-sentence to
     identify it.

                    JACOB
          What the hell is that?

                    FROST
          At first I just thought it was birds.

                    SEX MACHINE
          No, it's more of a gnawing sound.
          Birds peck, they don't gnaw. Rats
          gnaw.

     Seth puts the bottle in his hand down.

                    SETH
          It's bats.


     EXT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

     The outside of the Titty Twister is literally covered with
     hats, CLAWING, FLAPPING, GNAWING, trying like hell to get
     inside.


     INT. TITTY TWISTER - NIGHT

     Everybody listens to the bats SCRATCHING and clawing all
     along the walls, the roof and at the front door. Everyone's
     scared shitless and nobody has the slightest idea what to
     do next. The door begins to crack and splinter, little
     claws poke their way through.

                    JACOB
          Give me a hand!

     Jacob runs to a table top. He grabs it and covers the area
     the bats are trying to claw through. The others grab other
     items to help secure and barricade the door.

     As the survivors are panickedly boarding up the door and
     the windows, a DEAD BIKER that the vampires fed on, pops
     open his yellow eyes. He sits up and sees all the furious
     activity. Everyone's so busy they don't notice their new
     friend. The dead biker vamp sets his sights on Kate, who's
     putting a board into place. He springs to his feet and
     POUNCES on her, just as Sex Machine turns from across the
     room in her direction.

                    SEX MACHINE
          Watch out, girly!

     The biker vamp GRABS Kate from behind. She lets out a
     scream. The vamp holds her close to him in a bear hug, but
     she's moving around so much he can't get a clear bite. The
     others hear the scream and look toward Kate. Sex Machine,
     Big Emilio's baseball bat in hand, is halfway to the rescue.
     As the biker vamp opens his mouth to take a juicy bite out
     of Kate's shoulder, Kate RAMS her head back, hitting the
     vamp in the mouth and breaking his fangs. He releases her
     and spits out his teeth just as Sex Machine runs up and
     SWINGS the baseball bat upside the vamp's head, breaking
     the bat in two and sending the vamp to the floor. As the
     vamp lies on the floor seeing stars, Sex Machine grabs one
     of the broken ends of the bat and SHOVES it in the vamp's
     heart. He dies and bursts into flames.

     At that point, three other dead victims rise to a sitting
     position. Sex Machine grabs a chair and THROWS it to the
     ground, breaking it. He grabs the four legs.

                    SEX MACHINE
               (mumbling to himself)
          Goddamn fuckin' vampires.

     The biker has turned into Captain Sex Machine, Vampire
     Hunter. He stakes two of the vampires as they get to their
     feet. Both SPEW green blood, scream, die and burst into
     flames. The third, a trucker vampire wearing a cat cap,
     SMACKS Sex Machine in the mouth, which sends the biker for
     a loop.

     As CAT CAP runs toward the fallen Sex Machine, Kate JUMPS
     on his back from behind. Both of them go tumbling into a
     stack of whiskey cases. Sex Machine runs over and grabs Kate
     by the hand, pulling her up and out of the way. Cat Cap is
     lying in a pile of broken bottles and whiskey. Sex Machine
     raises his stake as Cat Cap dies and DRIVES it in the
     vamp's black heart. Cat Cap dies and bursts into flames,
     which hits the whiskey, starting a giant fire.

                    SEX MACHINE
          Fire!

     Frost and Jacob stop barricading and run to the fire.

                    FROST
               (to Sex Machine)
          We'll put this out. You stake the rest
          of these fuckers.

                    SEX MACHINE
          Way ahead of ya.
               (to Kate)
          What's your name, girly?

                    KATE
          Kate, what's yours?

                    SEX MACHINE
          Sex Machine. Pleased to meet'cha.
          Kate, let's stake these blood-sucker
          fuckers.

     Kate and Sex Machine give each other a high five and go to
     work STAKING the dead bodies.

     Jacob and FROST beat down the fire with their jackets and
     whatever else is at hand.

     A hole begins to appear where a window had been plastered
     over. Little claws scrape their way through. Scott stands
     in front of the window.

                    SCOTT
               (yelling)
          We got a problem!

     Seth, who is barricading doors and window, looks in Scott's
     direction. The hole in the plaster cracks open and out POPS
     a little, fleshy vampire bat/rat head. The bat/rat, which is
     SQUEAKING and HISSING its head off, tries to SQUEEZE its
     body through the newly formed hole.

     Seth, gun in hand, RUNS to the window. He points the .45,
     point-blank range at the head of the bat/rat.

     The bat/rat sees this, makes an "oh shit" face, and YANKS
     his head back through the hole.

     Seth was ready to fire, he lowers his gun in bewilderment,
     when...

     WHAM !

     The bat/rat BURSTS through the hole, like shot out of a
     cannon, HITTING Seth in the gut and sending him FLYING,
     LANDING HARD on his back.

     Once Seth hits the ground, the bat-thing (which has the body
     of a fat rat with a bat's large wingspan) lickity-split
     RUNS UP Seth's body to his juggler. Seth's hand GRABS the
     bat's neck, and tries to PUSH it away. But the bat-thing has
     its CLAWS DUG in Seth's clothes. The bat-thing is just
     inches from Seth's face. Its mouth is SNAPPING.

                    SETH
          Get this bastard off of me!

     Frost leaves Jacob with the fire, comes from behind and
     GRABS the bat-thing and YANKS it off of Seth.

     Sex Machine and Kate are a green, bloody mess from their
     preventative staking of dead bodies. Sex Machine kneels by a
     dead body, raising the stake in his hand to spear him. The
     body SPRINGS UP and bites Sex Machine on the arm. Red blood
     squirts all over. Sex Machine screams, then brings the stake
     down in the body's chest. It dies, burns and turns into goo.
     Sex Machine holds his bit arm and wraps it with a piece of
     his shirt. He quickly looks around to see if anybody saw him
     get bit. Nobody saw it, everybody was too busy.

     Frost holds the FLAPPING, FIGHTING, SNAPPING bat-thing in
     front of him at arm's length. He struggles with it for a
     while, then...

     BASHES its head against the bar. The first bash takes some
     fight out of the little fucker, so... Frost BASHES his head
     against the bar six or seven times. He then THROWS the
     bat-thing on the bar, turns it over, garbs a pencil in a
     cup next to the register, and RAMS it in the bat-thing's
     heart. The bat-thing coughs and dies. There's a FLASH of
     FLAMES, followed by a pile of goo.

     Sex Machine and Kate have covered up a hole in the plastered
     window with a table while Frost, Scott and Seth wrestle with
     the bat-thing.

     Jacob has put out the fire. Everybody comes together,
     exhausted, and takes a breather. Outside, the bats continue
     to try and claw their way in.

                    JACOB
          Is everybody okay?

     Everyone mutters "yeah."

                    JACOB
          Okay, does anybody here know what's
          going on?

                    SETH
          Yeah, I know what's going on. We got
          a bunch of fuckin' vampires outside
          trying to get inside and suck our
          fuckin' blood! That's it, plain and
          simple. And I don't wanna hear any
          bullshit about "I don't believe in
          vampires" because I don't fuckin'
          believe in vampires either. But I do
          believe in my own two fuckin' eyes,
          and with my two eyes I saw fuckin'
          vampires! Now, does everybody agree
          we're dealin' with vampires.

     Everybody agrees.

                    SETH
          You too, preacher?

                    JACOB
          I'm like you. I don't believe in
          vampires, but I believe in what I saw.

                    SETH
          Good for you. Now, since we all
          believe we're dealing with vampires,
          what do we know about vampires?
          Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a
          cross?

                    JACOB
          In the Winnebago.

                    SETH
          In other words, no.

                    SCOTT
          What are you talking about? We got
          crosses all over the place. All you
          gotta do is put two sticks together
          and you got a cross.

                    SEX MACHINE
          He's right. Peter Cushing does that
          all the time.

                    SETH
          I don't know about that. In order for
          it to have any power, I think it's
          gotta be an official crucifix.

                    JACOB
          What's an official cross? Some piece
          of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that
          official? If a cross works against
          vampires, it's not the cross itself,
          it's what the cross represents. The
          cross is a symbol of holiness.

                    SETH
          Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses
          covered, moving right along, what
          else?

                    FROST
          Wooden stakes in the heart been
          workin' pretty good so far.

                    SEX MACHINE
          Garlic, holy water, sunlight... I
          forget, does silver do anything to a
          vampire?

                    SCOTT
          That's werewolves.

                    SEX MACHINE
          I know silver bullets are werewolves.
          But I'm pretty sure silver has some
          sort of effect on vampires.

                    KATE
          Does anybody have any silver?

                    ALL
          No.

                    KATE
          Then who cares?

                    SCOTT
          When's sunrise?

     Jacob looks at his watch.

                    JACOB
          About two hours from now.

                    KATE
          So all we have to do is get by for a
          few more hours and then we can walk
          right out the front door.

                    SEX MACHINE
          Yeah, that's true, but I doubt our
          barricades, that door, those plastered
          windows and these walls will last two
          more hours with those bat fucks
          fuckin' with 'em.

                    JACOB
          Has anybody here read a real book
          about vampires, or are we just
          remembering what a movie said? I mean
          a real book.

                    SEX MACHINE
          You mean like a Time-Life book?

     Everybody laughs.

                    FROST
               (in a cowboy voice)
          John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once
          shot a man for snorin'.

                    JACOB
          I take it the answer's no. Okay then,
          what do we know about these vampires?

                    SETH
          Aside from they're thirsty.

                    FROST
          Well, one thing, they might got super
          human strength, but you can hurt 'em.

                    JACOB
          Yeah, that bottle upside the head of
          Santanico didn't kill her, but it
          didn't feel too good either.

                    SEX MACHINE
          Another thing, you try and ram a
          broken chair leg in a human, you
          better be one strong son-of-a-bitch.
          The human body is one rough-tough
          machine. But these vamps got soft
          bodies. The texture of their skin is
          softer, mushier. You can push shit
          right through 'em. Conceivably, if
          you hit one hard enough, you could
          take their fuckin' head off.

                    SCOTT
          You could take their head off.

                    SETH
          Actually, our best weapon against
          these satanic cocksuckers is this man.
               (he points at Jacob)
          He's a preacher.

     Frost and Sex Machine look toward Jacob.

                    SETH
          As far as God's concerned, we might
          just as well be a piece of fuckin'
          shit. But he's one of the boys. Only
          one problem, his faith ain't what it
          used to be.

     Jacob PUNCHES Seth in the mouth, sending him to the floor.
     Jacob stands over him.

                    JACOB
          I've had enough of your taunts.

     Seth looks up from the floor.

                    SETH
          I'm not taunting you. We need you. A
          faithless preacher doesn't mean shit
          to us. But a man who's a servant of
          God can grab a cross, shove it in
          these monsters' asses. A servant of
          God can bless the tap water and turn
          it into a weapon.

     Seth rises.

                    SETH
          I know why you lost your faith. How
          could true holiness exist if your wife
          can be taken away from you and your
          children? Now, I always said God can
          kiss my fuckin' ass. Well, I changed
          my lifetime tune about thirty minutes
          ago' cause I know, without a doubt,
          what's out there trying to get in
          here is pure evil straight from hell.
          And if there is a hell, and those
          monsters are from it, there's got to
          be a heaven. Now which are you, a
          faithless preacher or a mean,
          mother fuckin' servant of God?

     Jacob has to laugh at that. So does everybody else. Jacob
     sticks out his hand and shakes Seth's.

                    JACOB
          I'm a mean, mother fucking servant of
          God.

     The laughter and good humor passes quickly and the only
     sound to be heard is that of the bats gnawing and clawing.
     It immediately reminds the group of the deep, deep shit
     they're in.

                    KATE
          I don't know if I can take two hours
          of that noise.

                    FROST
          You can. You'll take it 'cause ya got
          no choice. How'd ya like twenty four
          hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch
          with only the rotting corpses of your
          friends to keep you company?

                    JACOB
          What are you talking about?

                    FROST
          Back in '72 I was in Nam, trapped
          behind enemy lines, lying in a rat hole
          with my entire squad dead. They
          thought they killed everybody, and
          except for me, they were right. But it
          wasn't for lack of trying. A grenade
          blew up right next to me, that's why
          I'm so pretty.

     They thought I was dead, so I played dead. They dumped all
     the bodies in a ditch. All I could do was lie there playing
     possum. Dead bodies under me, dead bodies on top of me,
     listening to the enemy laugh and joke hour after hour after
     hour...

     As Frost goes into his monologue, the sound fades out and
     the camera moves to Sex Machine. He's having a hot flash. He
     can't hear anything. He's looking at Frost speaking, but he
     doesn't hear any sound. Then he hears a deep, MALE VOICE
     say:

                    MALE VOICE (V.O.)
          Thirst.

     "Who the fuck was that?" he thinks to himself. He turns
     around: nobody's there. No one else in the group seems to
     hear it, A FEMALE VOICE seductively says:

                    FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
          Thirst.

     We hear Sex Machine's thought in a voice answer.

                    SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
          Stop fucking saying that!

                    TWO MALE VOICES (V.O.)
          Thirst!

                    SEX MACHINE (V.O.)
          That bite weren't nothin'. It just
          hurt like a son-of-a-bitch, that's
          all. It barely punched the skin.

     Sex Machine looks at Frost, who's acting out his story. The
     biker is pantomiming fighting and slashing. He's describing
     all the while, but we can't hear anything. All we hear are
     many voices, male, female, children saying:

                    VOICES (V.O.)
          Thirst... Thirst... Thirst...

     Sex Machine begins looking at the other members of the group
     in a thirsty way. He stares at each of their necks, closer
     and closer until he can see the veins on Frost's neck
     actually pulsating, throbbing, beckoning to him. Sex Machine
     has turned into a vampire.

     The sound comes back as Frost finishes his story.

                    FROST
          ...and then when I came back to my
          senses, I realized I had killed the
          entire V.C. squadron single handedly.
          My bayonet had blood and chunks of
          yellow flesh on it like some cannibal
          shish kabob. And to this day I don't
          have the slightest idea how I --

     Sex Machine lets out a hideous cry.

                    SEX MACHINE
          THIRST!

     Frost SCREAMS as Sex Machine grabs hold of him and BITES
     into his neck.

     The group tries to PULL the TWO men apart.

     Jacob gets his arm around Sex Machine's neck and tries
     pulling.

     Sex Machine takes his teeth out of the biker's neck and
     SINKS them in Jacob's arm.

     Jacob SCREAMS and lets go.

     Seth, Kate and Scott react to Jacob being bit.

     Sex Machine GRABS Jacob and TOSSES him effortlessly over the
     bar, CRASHING into a shelf full of liquor bottles.

     Frost HOPS around the room, mad as a hornet, holding his
     bleeding neck.

                    FROST
          I been bit! He fuckin' bit me!

     Sex Machine PUNCHES Seth in the face, dropping him like a
     sack of potatoes.

     He smacks the shit out of Kate. She goes FLYING into a
     table.

     Sex Machine turns, seeing Frost breaking off a big table
     leg. Frost looks at the big vamp.

                    FROST
               (to Sex Machine)
          You're dead, mother fucker! You're
          gonna bite me! You just turned me
          into a vampire, asshole!

                    SEX MACHINE
          What are you gonna do about it?

     Frost, table leg in hand, RUNS, SCREAMING his head off,
     straight at Sex Machine.

     Sex Machine's nostrils flare. He raises his meaty fist and
     pulls it back, so he can really haul off.

     Frost, top speed, stake raised, screaming. Sex Machine lets
     loose with his punch, Seth, Scott and Kate look up from the
     floor. Jacob rises from behind the bar. Frost's face
     COLLIDES with Sex Machine's fist. Sex Machine hits Frost so
     hard it lifts the biker off the ground and propels him
     through the air.

     Seth sees where Frost is heading and says:

                    SETH
          Oh shit!

     Jacob sees.

                    JACOB
          Good lord!

     Frost, in mid-air, HITS the barricaded, plastered overwindow
     and CRASHES through it.

     Sex Machine lets loose with a maniacal laugh. Hundreds of
     bat-things fly into the bar. Seth grabs the two kids by the
     hand and runs for the backroom.

     Behind the bar, Jacob grabs two pieces of wood from off the
     ground.

     Ten bat-things are in hot pursuit of Seth, Kate and Scott,
     who are RUNNING for their lives. They get to the door of the
     back room, whip it open, dive in and SLAM it behind them. An
     ugly, fleshy bat-thing manges to get its head caught in the
     door as it closes. Kate and Scott PUSH on the door as hard
     as they can. The bat-thing's head, which is inside, screams,
     howls and snaps in fury.

     Seth turns toward the bat/vamp in the door. He sticks his
     .45 in its big mouth.

                    SETH
          You wanna suck something, suck on
          this!

     He FIRES four shots that blow the bat vamp's head all over
     the wall.

     Kate yells:

                    KATE
          We have to go back for Daddy!

                    SETH
          Daddy's dead.

                    KATE
          Noooo!

     She spins and grabs the door knob, ready to fling the door
     and help her father. Scott grabs her and pushes her up
     against the wall.

                    SCOTT
          He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was
          too far away. If flinging that door
          and filling this room with those
          bat-things would save him, I'd fling
          it. The only thing it'll do is turn us
          into one of them.

                    SETH
          He needs our help!

                    SCOTT
          He's beyond our help. You saw him get
          bit. I saw him get bit. We all saw it.
          You can't help him. I've got no one
          left to lose but you. I can't be alone
          again. We're sticking together.

     Just then they hear Jacob's voice BOOMING from the bar room.


     INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT

     Jacob, holding a cross made out of two sticks and reciting
     appropriate verse from the bible, is keeping the vampires at
     bay. But, as Seth predicted, it is the shining power of his
     restored faith that is his mightiest weapon. Jacob is making
     his way through the vampires, toward the back door. A lot of
     the bats have transformed into bat/devil/human creatures.

     The creatures stand at the edge of Jacob's force field of
     holiness. Many bat things fly around the bar like mad,
     whirling dervishes. A cluster of bat-things over above and
     in front of Jacob. They all growl and hiss at the man of
     god. For every one step forward Jacob takes, the vampire
     stake one step back. Jacob recites the verse from the bible
     in a threatening, mean, mother fucking, servant of god tone.
     As he speaks with authority and strength, he sees Frost
     lying on the ground, bat-things on him like ants on a
     candy bar. But Jacob is too much in control to let even this
     repugnant sight trip him up.

     Jacob has backed himself up by the door.

                    JACOB
          Open the door.

     The door FLIES open. Jacob jumps inside. The door SLAMS
     shut.

     Jacob hugs daughter and son. As he hugs them, we see his
     bloody arm.

     When he releases them, they can't help but notice.

                    SETH
          Did he...?

                    JACOB
          Yep.

     Seth explodes, knocking over boxes, busting chairs, tipping
     over tables and cussing a blue streak.

                    SETH
          Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin'
          vampires! Mother fuckin' vampires!
          Goddamn mother fuckin' vampires!

     Seth runs over to the barricaded door and yells to the
     creatures on the other side.

                    SETH
          You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm
          gonna fuckin' kill every last one of
          you godless pieces of shit!

                    JACOB
               (to Seth)
          You bet your sweet ass you are, and
          I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't
          got much time.

     Kate is crying, she knows what's happened to her father.

                    KATE
          You're gonna be okay, aren't you,
          daddy?

                    JACOB
          No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect,
          I'm already dead.

     Scott and Kate, crying, grab their father and hold on for
     dear life. Jacob wants to cry, but if he breaks down, the
     kids will never have the courage for what they must do.

                    JACOB
               (to his children)
          Children, listen to me. I love you two
          more than anybody. And I just want you 
          to know you've made me proud all your
          lives. But never more so than tonight.
          And I wish we could sit here and cry
          till I pass on, but we can't. Because
          I'm not going to pass on. I'm going to
          turn into a monster. And when I do,
          I'm going to be dangerous. But before
          that happens, just know I love you.
               (to Seth and the kids)
          Now, I'd say in the next twenty or
          thirty minutes our friends outside
          will bust in this door. And I'll
          probably turn into a vampire within
          the hour. Now, you have two choices.
          You can wait for me to turn, then deal
          with me, then wait for them to burst
          inside here and the three of you will
          deal with them. Or, we can kick open
          that door and the four of us can hit
          'em with everything we have, and carve
          a path right through 'em to front
          entrance. But if we're gonna go at 'em,
          we gotta go at 'em now. I confused
          them, I scared them, I took them off
          guard. But they're going to get
          unconfused, they're going to get
          unscared, they're going to get
          together and they're going to hit that
          door like a ton of bricks. And when
          that moment arrives, we gotta be
          ready.

     Jacob sees that the back room is pretty damn big and filled
     with boxes and crates.

                    JACOB
          What's this stuff?

                    SETH
          My guess is that this little dive's
          been feeding on nomad road waifs like
          bikers and truckers for a longtime.
          This is probably some of the
          shipments they stole off the trucks.

                    JACOB
          Well, I say lets tear this place apart
          for weapons. So when they burst
          through that door, we'll make 'em wish
          they never did.

                    SETH
          I don't give a shit about living or
          dying anymore. I just want to send as
          many of these devils back to hell as
          I can.

                    JACOB
          Amen.

     MONTAGE

     The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A
     lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee,
     teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the
     doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield
     a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores
     are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of
     balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are
     shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.

     Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.

     Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
     backroom sink.

     Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet
     in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.

     Vampires all start converging on the back room door,
     getting their courage back.

     Kate makes water balloons.

     Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth
     attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.

     Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,
     turning it into holy water.

     Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.
     The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes,
     begins to be pounded on by the undead on the other side.
     The room tone is a combination of chewing, scratching,
     pounding, squeaking and screaming.

     Finally they're ready.

     Jacob turns to his kids.

                    JACOB
          Before we go any further, I need you
          three to promise me something. I'll
          fight with you to the bitter end,
          but when I turn into one of them, I
          won't be Jacob anymore. I'll be a
          lap dog of Satan. I want you three to
          promise you'll take me down, no
          different from the rest.

     The kids can't say the words.

                    SETH
          I promise.

                    JACOB
          Kate, Scott?

                    KATE
          I promise.

                    JACOB
          Scott?

                    SCOTT
          Yeah, I promise.

     Jacob doesn't believe them.

                    JACOB
          Why don't I believe you?
               (he picks up the .45)
          I'm gonna ask you two again, then I
          want you to swear to God that you'll
          kill me. If you don't, I'm gonna
          just kill myself right now. Now,
          since you need me I think you better
          swear. Kate, do you swear to God
          that when I turn into one of the
          undead, you'll kill me?

     Kate doesn't answer. Jacob places the .45 barrel against his
     temple.

                    JACOB
          Kate, we don't have all day, so I'm
          only gonna count to five. One...two...
          three... four...

                    KATE
          Okay, okay, I promise I'll do it!

                    JACOB
          Not good enough, swear to God.

                    KATE
          I swear to God, our father, that when
          you change into one of the undead, I
          will kill you.

                    JACOB
          Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even
          less time, so I'm only giving you the
          count of three. One...

                    SCOTT
          You don't believe in suicide.

                    JACOB
          It's not suicide if you're already
          dead. Two...

                    SCOTT
          Okay, I'll kill you when you change,
          I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.

                    JACOB
          Thank you, son.

                    SETH
          Okay, vampire killers, let's kill some
          fuckin' vampires.


     INT. BARROOM - NIGHT

     The vampires, bat-things and what have you, start BREAKING
     down the door. They are in a mad frenzy. They burst through
     the door.

     Waiting for them are Scott and Kate holding Uzi squirt guns
     and water balloons draped down their chests on a belt like
     grenades. Jacob is holding a cross made of sharp wooden
     stakes and the .45 with the cross bullets. Seth is holding
     the jackhammer. The survivors walk out of the back room
     into the bar. The vamps back up, letting them inside.

     What we have here is a Mexican standoff, a la "The Wild
     Bunch." A moment of peace before the battle. The vamps just
     watch the humans. The humans just watch the vamps. Then,
     like the bull in the china shop, Seth ends the peace by
     starting up the jackhammer.

                    SETH
          Kill 'em all!

     Jacob holds up the cross, the vamps react.

     The kids SPRAY the crowd with UZI fire, burning vampire
     flesh.

     The pack of vamps retreat while the Fuller squad walk
     forward.

     They are attacked on all sides, but they keep moving towards
     the door.

     Seth slams the stakes into several of the vamps, it speeds
     in and out of vampire chests, each time spraying him in
     green vamp blood.

     Jacob shoves his cross stake into a vampire with one hand
     and SHOOTS three vampires with blessed bullets with the
     other.

     Flame BURSTS from the vampires' chests when the bullets hit.

     Kate and Scott both whip water balloons off their belts and
     toss them into the crowd.

     They burst and FRY several of the vamps, who fall, screaming
     in pain.

     From its perch on a wood ceiling beam, a bat-thing drops and
     HURLS toward the group.

     Jacob sees it, raises his gun and FIRES.

     The bat-thing bursts into a ball of screaming fire.

     Seth continues carving a path to the front door by slamming
     the hammer stake into vampire chests.

     The front door is barricaded again by a big table and other
     junk.

                    SCOTT
               (yelling)
          Why did they block the door again?

                    JACOB
               (yelling)
          To keep the daylight out! This is
          where they sleep! Get to the door!

     Seth tries to get to the front door, when Sex Machine, now a
     half bat, half devil vamp, about six foot seven, drops from
     above in front of him. Seth RAMS the stake in its chest. The
     Sex Machine-thing screams out, LIFTING the hammer and Seth
     off the ground.

     Seth is thrown from his hold on the hammer across the room,
     he CRASHES into a table.

     The Sex Machine-thing falls back with the jackhammer
     sticking out of his chest, dead.

     Kate, spraying Uzi fire like Rambo, sees Seth fall. She
     screams:

                    KATE
          Seth!

     Seth quickly gets up to find himself surrounded by vampires
     on all sides. With no weapons, he puts up on dukes.

                    SETH
          Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite
          and feel all right!

     Kate clusters with her father and Scott.

                    KATE
               (yelling)
          I'm going for 'em!

                    JACOB
          No!

                    KATE
          Everybody goes home!

     Kate turns into a squirt gun firing, water-balloon throwing,
     one-woman army, as she breaks from her father and heads in
     Seth's direction.

                    KATE
               (screaming)
          Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die!

     Kate mows down the group by Seth, they lie on the floor,
     burning in agony. Kate takes Seth's hand and gives him a
     couple of water balloons and a stake.

                    KATE
               (to Seth)
          Watch my back!

                    SETH
          Anytime.

     Cutting through vampires, the two make their way across the
     bar.

     Jacob, firing the .45, takes out several more vampires in
     fiery death.

     Scott fires the Uzi and chucks more water balloons.

     As Jacob fights, all of a sudden the sound goes out. He
     can't hear anything. He wonders if he's gone deaf. He starts
     to hear the words: "Thirst, thirst, thirst." He notices the
     vampires have stopped attacking him. They look at him wit
     happy smiles on their devilish faces. Fangs begin to grow.
     His eyes are yellow.

     Scott turns to his dad. He sees his father is a monster.

     Jacob, with a devilish grin on his face, GRABS Scott and
     sinks his teeth into Scott's forearm. Scott screams bloody
     murder as his dad begins to drain him of blood.

     Scott takes one of the water balloons he's wearing and
     SMASHES it against Jacob's head.

     The holy water melts half of Jacob's face away. He lets go
     of Scott, screaming, and drops the .45 on the floor.

     Scott drops to the ground, picking up the gun. He brings it
     up to fire.

     A totally evil Jacob, with only half a face, matches stares
     with the boy he once called his son.

     Scott's eyes turn to steel.

                    SCOTT
          I swear to God, in Jesus Christ's
          name.

     He FIRES, sending a holy bullet into Jacob's forehead,
     creating a hole from which fire shoots out. Jacob's entire
     head bursts into flames, then explodes.

     From across the room, Fate sees her daddy ignite. She
     cries out. In the thick of the battle, Seth yells:

                    SETH
          Fight now, cry later.

     Kate takes his advice and hits a vamp square in the face
     with a holy water balloon, which melts his head.

     A bat-thing lands on the back of Scott's neck. He screams as
     it bites into him. He drops the .45.

     Kate sees Scott get bit.

                    KATE
          Oh my god.

     Another bat-thing lands on Scott's arm and takes a bite.
     Scott screams.

                    KATE
          You bastards!

     She goes to spray them when her Uzi runs out of water.

     Now seven bat-things are on Scott biting and sucking blood.
     Scott is in agony.

                    SCOTT
          Kill me, Kate! 

     Kate runs for her brother, does a DIVE and a ROLL, coming
     up by the .45, SNATCHING it in one motion and FIRING three
     times.

     One... two... three bat-things are hit, shoot flames, then
     all of them EXPLODE, BLOWING UP Scott.

     The remaining vamps approach.

     All the humans have left is a few bullets and one holy
     balloon.

                    SETH
          How many bullets left, kid?

                    KATE
          Not many.

                    SETH
          Well, when you run out of weapons,
          just start cold cocking 'em. Make 'em
          sing for their supper.

     The two survivors are backed up against a wall. Two bat
     things do a Kamikaze dive from the air toward Seth. Seth
     throws the holy balloon at them. Direct hit. The two
     bat-things burst into flames and spiral to the floor.

     The two survivors look at the vampires, who stand before
     them. A moment of stillness before the attack. Kate stands
     holding the .45, arm outstretched.

                    KATE
               (to Seth)
          Should I use the last bullets on us?

                    SETH
          You use 'em on the first couple of
          these parasites that try to bite you.

     The vamps begins to close in. Kate lines up the .45 sights
     on the face of an approaching vampire.

     Seth holds the Uzi like a club, ready to bash in the first
     vampire's head that gets in swinging distance.

     Beams of sunlight shoot through the holes that Kate shot
     through the wall. Approaching vampires burn. The scorched
     vamps scream like they've never screamed before.

                    SETH
          Shoot more holes!

     Kate turns away from the vamps and shoots holes in the wall
     behind him, Daylight comes through, providing Kate and
     Seth with a safe, lighted area.

     The .45's empty.

     The vamps hiss and scream at the frustration of not being
     able to get at them.

     The two survivors hold hands, when...

     All of a sudden the door to the Titty Twister is pounded on
     from the outside.

     The vamps look towards it in horror.

     From the other side of the door, we hear a voice with a
     Spanish accent.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
               (in Spanish)
          I'm looking for my friend. Is Seth in
          there?

                    SETH
               (yelling)
          Carlos!
               (in Spanish)
          Help us, bash the door. Bash the door
          in!

                    CARLOS (O.S.)
               (in Spanish)
          Danny, Manny, knock down the door.
          Hurry, hurry!

     The vamps are totally fucking freaked out! They run and fly
     around the bar in a panic. Crying, howling, grabbing onto
     each other.

     The front door is TORN apart from shotgun fir coming from
     the outside, punching holes the size of basketballs in the
     door.

     The table in front of the door gives and FALLS forward.

     The door caves in and sunlight invades the bar. Many vamps
     are instantly fried, bursting into flames.

     The Mexican gangster CARLSO and his two henchmen, DANNY and
     MANNY, are horrified at what they see. They cross themselves
     in fright.

     Vampires search for dark corners, but all is lost. Sunlight
     hits a mirrored ball attached to the ceiling, sending
     hundreds of beams of sunlight scattering through the room.
     Vamps try and dodge the beams. No dice. All around the vamps
     combust in fiery explosions.

     The Titty Twister is now on fire, burning out of control.

     Seth and Kate run through the building and leap through the
     door into the parking lot.


     EXT. TITTY TWISTER PARKING LOT - MORNING

     Carlos, Danny and Manny help them to their feet and walk
     them away from the blazing bar. They catch their breath by
     Carlos's Mercedes.

                    CARLOS
               (to Seth)
          What the fuck was going on in there?

     Seth signals Carlos to wait a minute while he catches his
     breath. Then he hauls off and PUNCHES Carlos square in the
     kisser. Danny and Manny aim their shotguns at Seth.

                    CARLOS
               (in Spanish)
          Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?

                    SETH
          Why the fuck, outta all the god
          forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you
          have us rendezvous at that place?

                    CARLOS
          I don't know, one place's as good as
          another.

                    SETH
          Have you ever been there before?

                    CARLOS
          No, but I passed by it a couple of
          times. It's out in the middle of
          nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place,
          so there wouldn't be a lot of police.
          And it's open from dusk till dawn.
          You said meet you in the morning.

                    SETH
          Well, because you picked that place
          out of a hat, my brother's dead now.
          And this girl's family's dead.

     Carlos stands up again.

                    CARLOS
          I'm sorry to hear that. What were
          they, psychos?

                    SETH
          Did they look like psychos? They
          were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't
          explode when sunlight hits 'em, I
          don't care how crazy they are.

     Danny and Manny react to the vampire news by crossing
     themselves again.

                    CARLOS
          Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up
          to you?

                    SETH
          You can't, but fifteen percent instead
          of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a
          good start.

                    CARLOS
          Twenty-eight.

                    SETH
          Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's
          dead and he's not coming back, and
          it's all your fault. Twenty.


     They look at each other, then shake hands, saying in unison.

                    SETH AND CARLOS
               (in Spanish)
          Twenty-five.

     Seth gets the suitcase and gives Carlos 25%. Seth walks over
     to a red 1990 Porsche 911.


                    CARLOS
          You like the car?

                    SETH
          I said new, this is an '90.

                    CARLOS
          It's hardly been used at all. I got it
          from a drug dealer who only drove it 5
          times in as many years. Swear to God.
          That's like new.

                    SETH
          So do I just follow you?

                    CARLOS
          Yeah, follow us.


                    SETH
          So let's do it.

                    CARLOS
               (to Danny and Manny)
          Vamanos!

     Carlos, Danny and Manny pile into Carlo's white Mercedes.

     Seth by his Porsche, looks back at Kate.

     Kate stands alone.

     The whole desert seems between them.

     So much to say ... but no words.

                    SETH
          I'm sorry.

                    KATE
          Me too.

     Long pause.

                    SETH
          See ya.

                    KATE
          Later.

     Seth turns his back on her. Just as he opens the door, Kate
     says behind him:

                    KATE (O.S.)
          Seth.

     Seth turns around.

                    KATE
          You want some company?

     Seth smiles.

                    SETH
          Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But
          I'm not a fuckin' bastard.

     He blows her a kiss across the desert.

     She blows one back.

     Seth's in his car and GONE.

     Kate turns around, faces endless desert before her, and
     begins her long walk home.

     THEME OF MOVIE BEGINS POUNDING

      THE END
