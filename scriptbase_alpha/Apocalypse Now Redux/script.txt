               EXT. A SIMPLE IMAGE OF TREES - DAY

               Coconut trees being VIEWED through the veil of time or a 
               dream. Occasionally colored smoke wafts through the FRAME, 
               yellow and then violet. MUSIC begins quietly, suggestive of 
               1968-69. Perhaps "The End" by the Doors.

               Now MOVING through the FRAME are skids of helicopters, not 
               that we could make them out as that though; rather, hard 
               shapes that glide by at random. Then a phantom helicopter in 
               FULL VIEW floats by the trees -- suddenly without warning, 
               the jungle BURSTS into a bright red-orange glob of napalm 
               flame.

               The VIEW MOVES ACROSS the burning trees as the smoke ghostly 
               helicopters come and go.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. SAIGON HOTEL - DAY

               A CLOSE SHOT, upside down of the stubble-covered face of a 
               young man. His EYES OPEN... this is B.L. WILLARD. Intense 
               and dissipated. The CAMERA MOVES around to a side view as he 
               continues to look up at a ROTATING FAN on the ceiling.

               EXT. IMAGES OF HELICOPTERS - DAY

               They continue to fly slowly, peacefully across the burning 
               jungle. The colored smoke comes and goes. Morrison continues 
               with "The End".

               INT. SAIGON HOTEL - DAY

               The CAMERA MOVES slowly across the room... and we SEE WILLARD, 
               a young army captain. He looks out the window to the busy 
               Saigon street.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Saigon... shit. I'm only in Saigon. 
                         Every time, I think I'm gonna wake 
                         up back in the jungle.

               He moves back to the bed, lies down. He's unshaven, exhausted, 
               probably drunk. We SEE alcohol bottles, photos, documents 
               scattered on the table.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         When I was home after my first tour, 
                         it was worse. I'd wake up and there'd 
                         be nothing. I hardly said a word to 
                         my wife until I said yes to a divorce. 
                         When I was here, I wanted to be there. 
                         When I was there... all I could think 
                         of was getting back into the jungle. 
                         I'm here a week now. Waiting for a 
                         mission. Getting softer. Every minute 
                         I stay in this room, I get weaker. 
                         And every minute Charlie squats in 
                         the bush... he gets stronger. Each 
                         time I looked around... the walls 
                         moved in a little tighter.

               He's up now, naked, going into a frenzy, drinking, doing 
               some sort of martial arts, eventually collapsing onto the 
               floor.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               INT. SAIGON HOTEL - STAIRWAY - DAY

               Two extremely sharp army men walk up the stairs to Willard's 
               room, a SERGEANT and a PRIVATE.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Everyone gets everything he wants. I 
                         wanted a mission. And for my sins, 
                         they gave me one. Brought it up to 
                         me like room service.

               They knock on the door. A second knock. 

                                     SERGEANT
                         Captain Willard, are you in there?

                                     WILLARD
                         Yeah I'm coming.

               The army men wait for him.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         It was a real choice mission. And 
                         when it was over, I'd never want 
                         another.

               Willard unlocks the door and opens it. The men react to his 
               condition.

                                     WILLARD
                         What do you want?

                                     SERGEANT
                         Are you all right, Captain?

                                     WILLARD
                         What's it look like?

               Willard turns back into the room, sits on the bed. The 
               Sergeant follows him.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Are you Captain Willard? 505th 
                         Battalion? 173rd Air-Borne? Assigned 
                         to SOG?

               Willard looks over at the Private by the door.

                                     WILLARD
                         Hey, buddy, you gonna shut the door?

               The private enters the room, closing the door behind him.

                                     SERGEANT
                         We have orders to escort you to the 
                         airfield.

                                     WILLARD
                         What are the charges? What did I do?

                                     SERGEANT
                         There's no charges, Captain.

               The sergeant opens the letter he has been holding.

                                     SERGEANT
                         You have orders to report to Com-Sec 
                         Intelligence at Nah Trang.

               He holds up the letter in front of Willard's face so he can 
               see it. We see the word 'RESTRICTED' across the top.

                                     WILLARD
                         I see.

                                     SERGEANT
                         All right?

                                     WILLARD
                         Nah Trang, for me?

                                     SERGEANT
                         That's right.

               The sergeant folds the letter back and puts it back in the 
               envelope. Willard doesn't move.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Come on, Captain, you still have a 
                         few hours to get cleaned up.

                                     WILLARD
                         I'm not feeling too good.

               He lays his head on the pillow and closes his eyes.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Captain?
                              (to private)
                         Dave, come here and give me a hand. 
                         We've got a dead one.

               The two of them move over to Willard and pick him up.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Come on Captain, Let's go take a 
                         shower.

                                     WILLARD
                         Don't be an ass.

                                     SERGEANT
                              (to private)
                         Get hold of him good. We're going to 
                         take a shower, Captain.

               They drag him into the shower, and turn on the cold water.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Stand under this, Captain.

               Willard shudders and yells as they begin to clean him up.

               EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND - DAY

               A darkly painted Huey lands in a guarded military compound 
               somewhere in Nah Trang. The two enlisted men jump out of the 
               helicopter, leading Willard, who seems in much better shape. 
               As he gets out he sees a platoon of new men drilling in the 
               hot hazy sun. They are clean and pale.

                                     MEN
                              (chanting)
                         I wanna go to Vietnam. I wanna kill 
                         a Vietcong --

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         I was going to the worst place in 
                         the world, and I didn't even know it 
                         yet. Weeks away and hundreds of miles 
                         up river that snaked through the war 
                         like a circuit cable... plugged 
                         straight into Kurtz.

               He follows the escort across the fields as the platoon drills.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         It was no accident that I got to be 
                         the caretaker of Colonel Walter E. 
                         Kurtz's memory, any more that being 
                         back in Saigon was an accident. There 
                         was no way to tell his story without 
                         telling my own. And if his story is 
                         really a confession, then so is mine.

               They approach a civilian-type luxury trailer. It is surrounded 
               by concertina wire, and its windows have grenade protection, 
               but it still seems out of place in this austere military 
               base.

               CLOSER ON WILLARD

               He stands before the door for a moment, as the M.P.s guarding 
               the trailer check his papers.

               INT. TRAILER - DAY

               Cool and comfortable, furnished like home. Pictures on the 
               walls, certificates, photos of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson 
               and Nixon and other mementos decorating the room.

               A small table is covered with linen and place settings for 
               three.

               Willard enters.  He salutes, and the COLONEL salutes him 
               back.

                                     COLONEL
                              (to Willard)
                         Captain. Good. Come on in.

                                     WILLARD
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     COLONEL
                         Stand at ease.

               Willard notices somebody O.S. and reacts.

                                     WILLARD
                         General.

               The General crosses over to a cabinet and picks up a pack of 
               cigarettes, as the CAMERA REVEALS a CIVILIAN; probably with 
               the Department of Defense, sitting at the bar, and a GENERAL 
               sitting on a sofa.

               The colonel turns and offers Willard a cigarette from the 
               pack.

                                     COLONEL
                              (to Willard)
                         Do you want a cigarette?

                                     WILLARD
                         No thank you, sir.

                                     COLONEL
                              (indicating civilian)
                         Captain, have you ever seen this 
                         gentleman before?

                                     WILLARD
                         No, sir. Not personally.

                                     COLONEL
                         You've worked a lot on your own, 
                         haven't you, Captain?

                                     WILLARD
                         Yes, sir, I have.

                                     COLONEL
                         Your report specifies intelligence, 
                         counter-intelligence with Com-Sec, I 
                         Corps.

                                     WILLARD
                         I'm not presently disposed to discuss 
                         those operations, sir.

               There is a pause as the colonel lights his cigarette, then 
               moves to the sofa. He bends down and picks up a dossier, 
               looks at it.

                                     COLONEL
                         Did you not work for the CIA in I 
                         Corps?

                                     WILLARD
                              (pause)
                         No, sir.

                                     COLONEL
                         Did you not assassinate a government 
                         tax collector... Quang Tri province 
                         June 18, 1968?

               Willard doesn't answer.

                                     COLONEL
                         Captain?

                                     WILLARD
                         Sir, I am unaware of any such activity 
                         or operation, nor would I be disposed 
                         to discuss an operation, if it did 
                         in fact exist, sir.

               A pause. Willard is tired and confused and hung over, but he 
               is handling himself well. The general rises.

                                     GENERAL
                         I thought we'd have a bit of lunch 
                         while we talked. I hope you brought 
                         a good appetite, Captain.

               Willard gets up and moves towards the dining table with the 
               general and the civilian. They sit down.

                                     GENERAL
                         I noticed that you have a bad hand 
                         there. Are you wounded?

                                     WILLARD
                         Had a little fishing accident on R 
                         and R, sir.

                                     GENERAL
                         Fishing on R and R?

                                     WILLARD
                         Yes, sir.

                                     GENERAL
                         But you're feeling fit? You're ready 
                         for duty?

                                     WILLARD
                         Yes, General. Very much so, sir.

               The food is being passed around.

                                     GENERAL
                         Well, let's see what we have here. 
                         Roast beef, and usually it's not 
                         bad.
                              (to civilian)
                         Try some, Jerry. Pass it around. To 
                         save a little time, we might pass 
                         both ways.
                              (to Willard)
                         Captain, I don't know how you feel 
                         about this shrimp, but if you eat 
                         it, you'll never have to prove your 
                         courage in any other way.

               The colonel, who is not eating with them, walks to the table, 
               holding a small photo.

                                     COLONEL
                              (to Willard)
                         Captain, you've heard of Captain 
                         Walter E. Kurtz?

               He shows the photo to Willard.

               INSERT THE PHOTO

               It's an eight-by-ten black-and-white portrait of an army 
               officer wearing a beret.

                                     WILLARD
                         Yes, sir. I've heard the name.

               The Colonel accidentally drops the dossier. Papers, photos, 
               etc., scatter all over the floor. He stoops down to pick 
               them up.

                                     COLONEL
                         Jesus... Operations officer, Fifth 
                         Special Forces.

                                     GENERAL
                         Luke, would you play that tape, for 
                         the captain, please?
                              (to Willard)
                         Listen to it carefully, Captain.

               The Colonel moves to a tape recorder and turns it on.

                                     MALE VOICE (ON TAPE) (V.O.)
                         "October 9, 04:30 hours, Sector Peter, 
                         Victor, King."

                                     GENERAL
                         These were monitored out of Cambodia.  
                         It's been verified as Colonel Kurtz's 
                         voice.

               All the men, including Willard, listen in wonder.

                                     KURTZ (ON TAPE) (V.O.)
                         "I watched a small snail, crawling 
                         on the edge of a straight razor. 
                         That's my dream. It's my nightmare. 
                         Crawling, slithering, along the edge 
                         of a straight razor, and surviving."

                                     MALE VOICE (ON TAPE) (V.O.)
                         "Transmission 11, received '68, 
                         December 30, 05:00 hours, Sector 
                         King, Zulu, King".

                                     KURTZ (ON TAPE) (V.O.)
                         "But we must kill them. We must 
                         incinerate them. Pig after pig. Cow 
                         after cow. Village after village.  
                         Army after army. And they call me an 
                         assassin. What do you call it, when 
                         the assassins accuse the assassin? 
                         They lie. They lie and we have to be 
                         merciful, for those who lie. Those 
                         nabobs. I hate them. I really hate 
                         them."

               The TAPE is TURNED OFF.

                                     GENERAL
                         Walter Kurtz was one of the most 
                         outstanding officers this country's 
                         ever produced. He was brilliant. He 
                         was outstanding in every way. And he 
                         was a good man, too. A humanitarian 
                         man. A man of wit and humor. He joined 
                         the Special Forces, and after that, 
                         his ideas, methods, became... unsound.  
                         Unsound.

                                     COLONEL
                         Now he's crossed into Cambodia with 
                         this Montagnard army of his, that 
                         worship the man like a god, and follow 
                         him every order, however ridiculous. 
                         Well, I have some other shocking 
                         news to tell you. Colonel Kurtz was 
                         about to be arrested for murder.

                                     WILLARD
                         I don't follow sir. Murdered who?

                                     COLONEL
                         Kurtz had ordered the execution of 
                         some Vietnamese intelligence agents. 
                         Men he believed were double agents. 
                         So he took matters into his own hands.

                                     GENERAL
                         Well, you see, Willard, in this war, 
                         things get confused out there. Power, 
                         ideals, the old morality, and 
                         practical military necessity. But 
                         out there with these natives, it 
                         must be a temptation to be God.  
                         Because the rational and the 
                         irrational, between good and evil. 
                         And good does not always triumph. 
                         Sometimes, the dark side overcomes 
                         what Lincoln called the better angels 
                         of our nature. Every man has got a 
                         breaking point. You have and I have 
                         them. Walter Kurtz has reached his. 
                         And, very obviously, he has gone 
                         insane.

               Willard looks from the colonel to the general to the civilian. 
               They are intensely interested in his response, which they 
               want to be "yes."

                                     WILLARD
                              (carefully)
                         Yes, sir. Very much so, sir. Obviously 
                         insane.

               The three men pull back, satisfied.

                                     COLONEL
                         Your mission is to proceed up the 
                         Nung River in a navy patrol boat, 
                         pick up Colonel Kurtz's path at Nu 
                         Mung Ba, follow it, learn what you 
                         can along the way. When you find the 
                         colonel, infiltrate his team by 
                         whatever means available, and 
                         terminate the colonel's command.

                                     WILLARD
                              (to General)
                         Terminate... the colonel?

                                     GENERAL
                         He's out there operating without any 
                         decent restraint, totally beyond the 
                         pale of any acceptable human conduct. 
                         And he is still on the field 
                         commanding troops.

                                     CIVILIAN
                         Terminate with extreme prejudice.

               The civilian hands Willard a cigarette, and lights it for 
               him.

                                     COLONEL
                         You understand, Captain, that this 
                         mission does not exist, nor will it 
                         ever exist.

               CLOSE ON WILLARD

               Smoking the cigarette, thinking about the mission.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE MEKONG DELTA - DUSK

               A HUEY helicopter flying over the mountains moves over rice 
               paddies, the Mekong River, MOVING CLOSER until we view a 
               dock area.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         How many people had I already killed?  
                         There were those six that I knew 
                         about for sure... close enough to 
                         blow their last breath in my face. 
                         But this time it was an American, 
                         and an officer. That wasn't supposed 
                         to make any difference to me, but it 
                         did.

               We SEE a small patrol boat. It moves away from the dock, out 
               into the delta.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Shit. Charging a man with murder in 
                         this place was like handing out 
                         speeding tickets at the Indy 500. I 
                         took the mission. What the hell else 
                         was I gonna do? But I really didn't 
                         know what I'd do when I found him.

               EXT. PBR - DAY

               We are CLOSE ON THE BOAT, the PBR. Willard is lying on the 
               deck, his eyes closed.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         I was being ferried down the coast 
                         in a navy PBR, a type of plastic 
                         patrol boat, pretty common sight on 
                         the rivers. They said it was a good 
                         way to pick up information, and move 
                         without drawing a lot of attention. 
                         That was okay. I needed the air and 
                         the time. Only problem was, I wouldn't 
                         be alone.

               Willard awakens to see a young black crewman squatting in 
               front of him, brushing his teeth.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         The crew were mostly just kids. Rock 
                         'n' rollers with one foot in their 
                         graves.
                              (to Clean)
                         How old are you?

                                     CLEAN
                         Seventeen.

               VIEW ON CHEF, lanky, with a mustache.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         The machinist, the one they called 
                         Chef, was from New Orleans. He was 
                         wrapped too tight for Vietnam. 
                         Probably too tight for New Orleans.

               VIEW ON LANCE, blonde, handsome, laid-back surfer type. He 
               is sunning himself with a reflector.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Lance, from the forward 50's, was a 
                         famous surfer from the beaches south 
                         of L.A. To look at him, you wouldn't 
                         believe he's ever fired a weapon in 
                         his life.

               VIEW ON CLEAN, the young black man brushing his teeth.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Mr. Clean was from some South Bronx 
                         shit-hole, and I think the light and 
                         the space of Vietnam really put the 
                         zap on his head.

               VIEW ON THE CHIEF, an older black man. He is at the helm, 
               studying a map of the delta.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Then there was Phillips, Chief. It 
                         might have been my mission, but it 
                         sure as shit was the Chief's boat.

                                     PHILLIPS
                              (to Willard)
                         There's about two points where we 
                         can draw enough water to get into 
                         the Nung River. They're both hot, 
                         belong to Charlie.

                                     WILLARD
                         Don't worry about it.

               He takes out a pack of cigarettes and offers one to the Chief.

                                     CHIEF
                         Don't smoke. You know, I've pulled a 
                         few special Ops in here. About six 
                         months ago, I took a man who was 
                         going past the bridge at Do Lung. He 
                         was regular army, too. I heard he 
                         shot himself in the head.

               Willard lights his cigarette as the boat continues to move 
               out into the ocean.

               EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - DAY

               Willard is sitting, smoking a cigarette, and looking down at 
               a large pouch. He opens the flap and WE SEE there are several 
               dossiers inside. He opens one, thumbing through the material. 
               WE SEE the personal letters, photographs, reports, files-the 
               entire case history of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         At first, I thought they handed me 
                         the wrong dossier. I couldn't believe 
                         they wanted this man dead. Third-
                         generation West Point, top of his 
                         class... Korea, Airborne, about a 
                         thousand decorations, etc., etc. I'd 
                         head his voice on the tape and it 
                         really put the hook in me, but I 
                         couldn't connect up that voice with 
                         this man. Like they said, he had an 
                         impressive career.  Maybe too 
                         impressive. I mean, perfect. He was 
                         being groomed for one of the top 
                         slots in the corporation. General, 
                         chief of staff, anything. In 1964, 
                         he returned from a tour with Advisory 
                         Command in Vietnam, and things started 
                         to slip. His report to the Joint 
                         Chiefs of Staff and Lyndon Johnson 
                         was restricted. Seems they didn't 
                         dig what he had to tell them. During 
                         the next few months, he made three 
                         requests... for transfer to Airborne 
                         training, Fort Benning, Georgia... 
                         and was finally accepted. Airborne?  
                         He was thirty-eight years old. Why 
                         the fuck would he do that? 1966... 
                         joins Special Forces, returns to 
                         Vietnam.

               Suddenly we HEAR a sound, a distant EXPLOSION. The crew all 
               stop whatever they are doing, look out beyond the shore and 
               the green jungled hills. There is a distant ROLLING NOISE, 
               like interrupted thunder. The buffeting and noise continue.

               EXT. SKY - FULL SHOT - DAY

               Way up -- past any clouds and barely discernible we SEE the 
               black silhouettes of four B-52 bombers, their vapor trails 
               streaming white against the dark blue sky.

                         Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

                         Let's have a look Chief.

               The Chief hands Willard the field glasses. He looks through 
               them out at the burning coastline.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         It was the Air-Cav, First of the 
                         Ninth.
                              (to Chief)
                         That's them.

               All the crew move to battle positions, get their flak jackets, 
               helmets, etc.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Our escorts to the mouth of Nung 
                         River. But they were supposed to be 
                         waiting for us another thirty 
                         kilometers ahead. Well, Air Mobile. 
                         Those boys just couldn't stay put.

               The PBR moves to the beach through a chaos of other boats, 
               low-flying helicopters, and soldiers rushing by onshore.

               EXT. BEACH AND VILLAGE - DAY

               A vast field of devastation, smashed and burning huts, 
               shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the surf. 
               Willard jumps off the boat, Clean and Lance fall in behind 
               him, they head ashore.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         First of the Ninth was an old cavalry 
                         division that had cashed in its horses 
                         for choppers, and gone tear-assni' 
                         around Nam looking for shit. They'd 
                         given Charlie a few surprises in 
                         their time here. What they were 
                         mopping up now hadn't even happened 
                         yet an hour ago.

               They make their way across the beach, weapons in hand.  
               Explosions go off around them; there is smoke everywhere. 
               Suddenly they are stopped by a VOICE.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Go on, keep going. It's for 
                         television. Don't look at the camera.

               Willard and the two who are following stop incredulously, 
               their M16s still in hand.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Go on, go on, keep going. Don't look 
                         at the camera.

               REVERSE ANGLE OF WHAT THEY SEE

               A NEWS TEAM, dressed in fatigues and combat dress. A director, 
               cameraman, and soundman; the director keeps waving them by.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (to Troops)
                         Just go by like you're fighting. 
                         Don't look at the camera. It's for 
                         television. Just go through. Just go 
                         by. Keep on going.

               Willard, Lance, and Clean run by, staring into the camera 
               the entire time.

               They make their way toward the village under siege. Willard 
               stops to talk with a SERGEANT, as a medevac helicopter takes 
               off in the background. The Hueys and Loches in the sky drown 
               out most of their conversation.

               CLOSE ON WILLARD

               Looking up as the Hueys sweep in low.

                                     WILLARD
                         Where Can I find the CO?

                                     SERGEANT
                         That's the colonel coming down!

               He points to a particular Huey in the sky, and moves to a 
               clear spot by a large bomb crater. He takes out a smoke bomb 
               and pulls the pin and lays it down in the clearing, as it 
               spews out orange smoke.

                                     WILLARD
                              (to his men)
                         CO's on that chopper.

               Willard moves back to Lance and Clean, they all kneel, trying 
               to avoid the propeller wash, as they look up.

               FULL VIEW

               The helicopter is heavily laden with machine guns, etc., as 
               it lands in the middle of the clearing.

               A tall, strong-looking man jumps out of the helicopter.  
               This is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE. He puts on his Air-Cav hat, 
               then stands to his full immense height and with his hands on 
               his hips, surveys the field of battle.

                                     KILGORE
                         Lieutenant, bomb that tree line back 
                         about a hundred yards. Give me some 
                         room to breath.

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Yes, sir!

               Kilgore starts walking, then turns and shouts to the 
               LIEUTENANT.

                                     KILGORE
                         Bring me my body cards!

                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Yes, sir!

               The Lieutenant moves back to the helicopter and Kilgore 
               continues forward toward a besieged village. A CAPTAIN from 
               tank division comes running down the street, stops in front 
               of Kilgore.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I'm the Fourth Tank commander. I've 
                         got five tanks broken down.

                                     KILGORE
                         All right with the tanks. It's all 
                         right, Captain.

               The captain turns and exits, as the sergeant walks up leading 
               Willard, Lance, and Clean.

                                     WILLARD
                         Captain Willard.

               They exchange salutes. Willard takes out a set of orders and 
               hands them to him.

                                     WILLARD
                         I carry priority papers from Com-Sec 
                         Intelligence, II Corps! I understand 
                         Nah Trang has briefed you on the 
                         requirements of my mission.

                                     KILGORE
                         What mission? I haven't heard from 
                         Nah Trang.

               Kilgore hands the orders to the major, who has joined him.  
               He looks at them and shakes his head "no."

                                     WILLARD
                         Sir, you're supposed to escort us 
                         into the Nung!

               The major hands the orders back to Willard. By this time the 
               lieutenant has run back in from the helicopter with the deck 
               of playing cards. He hands them to Kilgore.

                                     KILGORE
                         We'll see what we can do about that! 
                         Just stay out of my way till this is 
                         done, Captain!

               Kilgore cracks the plastic wrapping sharply, takes the deck 
               of new cards and fans them. Then he strides past willard and 
               his two young crewmen with no further acknowledgement-the 
               others follow.

               He moves through the shell-pocked field of devastation, 
               soldiers gathering around him. As he comes to each V.C. 
               corpse, he drops a card on it, carefully picking out which 
               card he uses.

                                     KILGORE
                              (to himself)
                         All right, let's see what we have. 
                         Two of spades. Three of spades. Four 
                         of diamonds, six of clubs... there 
                         isn't one worth a jack in the whole 
                         bunch. Four of diamonds...

               He crosses on down the street, distributing his cards on top 
               of the dead V.C. corpses.

               Willard, Lance, and Clean have been following Kilgore. Willard 
               bends down and picks up one of the cards from a dead V.C.

                         Death cards. Lets Charlie know who 
                         did this.

               MOVING SHOT OF KILGORE

               As he moves through the corpses, selecting a card and flipping 
               it on a body, or putting it behind an ear.

                                     KILGORE
                              (to a shell-shocked 
                              G.I)
                         Cheep up, son.

               As they pass by a well, two G.I.s jump out of it.

                                     G.I.
                         Fire in the hole!

               They all hit the deck, as a tremendous explosion comes out 
               of the well.

               Kilgore, his lieutenant, and major stop in back of a large 
               gathering of villagers. They are standing around a G.I. and 
               ARVN Interpreter, listening to them.

                                     SOLDIER (OVER P.A.)
                         This is an area that's controlled by 
                         the Vietcong and North Vietnamese! 
                         We are here to help you! We are here 
                         to extend a welcome hand to those of 
                         you who would like to return to the 
                         arms of the South Vietnamese 
                         government.

               A line of villagers are throwing all their belongs on top of 
               a large APC parked by the road, and filing into the carrier. 
               Kilgore stops and watches the G.I.s help them, then he moves 
               over and looks at the inside, where the villagers are crowded 
               together, waiting and scared.

                                     KILGORE
                              (to woman)
                         Get in! Hurry up!
                              (to soldier)
                         Move it out!

                                     SOLDIER (OVER P.A.)
                         This is an area that is controlled 
                         by the Vietcong and North 
                         Vietnamese...

               Kilgore turns and continues down the burning street with his 
               group. He comes upon a wounded V.C., groaning. The man has 
               tied a wash bowl over his belly and is groaning for water. 
               Kilgore turns to a soldier.

                                     KILGORE
                         What's this?

                                     SOLDIER (OVER P.A.)
                         This man's hurt pretty bad, sir. 
                         About the only thing holding his 
                         guts in, sir, is that pot lid.

                                     KILGORE
                              (to ARVN soldier)
                         Yeah? What does he have to say?

                                     ARVN SOLDIER
                         This soldier is dirty V.C. He wants 
                         water. He can drink paddy water.

                                     KILGORE
                         Get out of here! Give me that canteen.

               He pushes the ARVN soldier away, turns, and then gets a 
               canteen full of water from the lieutenant.

                                     KILGORE
                         Any man who's brave enough the fight --
                              (to ARVN soldier)
                         Get outta here! I'll kick you fucking 
                         ass! Any man brave enough to fight 
                         with his guts strapped on him can 
                         drink from my canteen any day.

               He stoops down -- starts to quench the prisoner's thirst 
               from his canteen. A soldier rushes up to him.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Colonel, I think one of those sailors 
                         is Lance Johnson, the surfer.

                                     KILGORE
                         Where? Here? You sure?

               The solder points at Lance.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Down there.

               Kilgore rises, hands the canteen back, and moves over to 
               Willard and his crew.  Looks at Lance.

                                     KILGORE
                         What's your name, sailor?

                                     LANCE
                              (salutes)
                         Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson, 
                         sir.

                                     KILGORE
                         Lance Johnson the surfer?

                                     LANCE
                         Yes, sir.

               Kilgore smiles, sticks out his hand.

                                     KILGORE
                         Well, it's an honor to meet you Lance. 
                         I've admired your nose riding for 
                         years. Your cutback, too. I think 
                         you have the best cutback there is.

                                     LANCE
                         Thank you, Sir.

                                     KILGORE
                         You can cut out the "sir" crap, Lance. 
                         I'm Bill Kilgore. I'm a goofy foot.

               Kilgore leads Lance off to meet some other soldiers. Willard's 
               entire top-priority mission has been out in the background.

                                     KILGORE
                              (making introductions)
                         I want you to meet some guys. This 
                         is Mike from San Diego. Johnny from 
                         Malibu. We're pretty solid surfers. 
                         None of us are anywhere near your 
                         class, though.

                                     MIKE
                         No way.

               Lance shakes their hands. Kilgore moves on, the group follow 
               him.

                                     KILGORE
                         We do a lot of surfing around here, 
                         Lance. I like to finish operations 
                         early, fly down to Yung Tau for the 
                         evening glass. Been riding since you 
                         got here?

                                     LANCE
                         No way. I haven't surfed since I 
                         been here.

               They stop to see Catholic Mass going on in the middle of a 
               graveyard. Many helicopters continue to hover overhead. 
               Willard looks around him, looks at the Mass being held, as 
               the Priest continues his alter on a gravestone in the midst 
               of the bombing and evacuations.

               EXT. AREA BY DESTROYED VILLAGE - NIGHT

               The area is illuminated by large cans filled with sand and 
               jet fuel, bonfires, and the burning village in the background. 
               There are maybe fifteen to twenty helicopters secured against 
               the wind, in orderly patterns. Men are grouped around the 
               fires, eating steaks, hot dogs, hamburgers, drinking beer. 
               It has the bizarre resemblance of some sort of barbarian 
               beach party.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Kilgore had a pretty good day for 
                         himself. They choppered in the T-
                         bones and the beer... and turned the 
                         L.Z. into a beach party. The more 
                         they tried to make it like home, the 
                         more they made everybody miss it.

               Kilgore is seated at the fire with some of his men, strumming 
               a guitar and singing.

                                     KILGORE
                              (to the Chief)
                         Make my meat rare. Rare but not cold.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Well, he wasn't a bad officer, I 
                         guess. He loved his boys, and you 
                         felt safe with him. We was one of 
                         those guys that had a weird light 
                         around him. You just knew he wasn't 
                         going to get so much of a scratch 
                         here.

               Kilgore looks at Willard, who more or less sits by himself.

                                     KILGORE
                         What happened to your mission, 
                         Captain? Nah Trang forget all about 
                         you?

               He laughs. Willard gets up, carrying the map he's patiently 
               been holding. He lays it down in front of Kilgore; squats 
               and points.

                                     WILLARD
                         Sir, two places we can get into the 
                         river. Here and here. It's a pretty 
                         wide delta, but these are the only 
                         two spots I'm really sure of.

                                     KILGORE
                         That village you're pointing at is 
                         kind of hairy, Willard.

                                     WILLARD
                         What do you mean "Hairy", sir?

                                     KILGORE
                         It's hairy. Got some pretty heavy 
                         ordinance. I've lost a few recon 
                         ships in there now and again.

               The Chief comes over, leans in to take a look at the map.

                                     KILGORE
                         What's the name of that goddamn 
                         village, Vin Drin Dop or Lop? Damn 
                         gook names all sound the same.
                              (to one of the surfer 
                              soldiers)
                         Mike, you know anything about this 
                         point at Vin Drin Dop?

                                     MIKE
                         That's a fantastic peak.

                                     KILGORE
                         Peak?

                                     MIKE
                         About six foot. It's an outstanding 
                         peak. It's got both the long right 
                         and left side, with a bowl section 
                         that's unbelievable. It's just tube 
                         city.

               Kilgore considers this.

                                     KILGORE
                         Well, why didn't you tell me that 
                         before? A good peak. There aren't 
                         any good peaks in this whole shitty 
                         country. It's all goddamn beach break.

                                     MIKE
                         It's really hairy in there, sir. 
                         That's where we lost McDonald. They 
                         shot the hell out of us there. That's 
                         Charlie's point.

               Willard sees his chance, jumps in.

                                     CHIEF
                         We may not be able to get the boat 
                         in. The draft at the mouth of that 
                         river may be too shallow.

               The colonel rises, looks at Willard.

                                     KILGORE
                         We'll pick your boat up and put it 
                         down like a baby, right where you 
                         want it. This is the First of the 
                         Ninth, Air-Cav, son. Air mobile! I 
                         can take that point and hold it just 
                         as long as I like, and you can get 
                         any place up that river that suits 
                         you, young Captain. Hell, a six-foot 
                         peak! All right. Take a gunship back 
                         to division.
                              (to Lance)
                         Lance, go with Mike and let him pick 
                         out a board for you. And bring me my 
                         Yater Spoon, the eight-six.

               Mike reacts, doubtful.

                                     KILGORE
                         What is it, soldier?

                                     MIKE

               EXT. HELICOPTER FIELD OUTSIDE DESTROYED VILLAGE - DAY

               It is the next morning. The helicopters, pilots, and men are 
               ready for battle. The helicopters slowly start up, as the 
               soldiers scurry to their various positions.

               We FOLLOW Kilgore and his group, including Willard, the Chief, 
               Clean, Lance, etc., as they walk across the field. They all 
               get into a helicopter, except Kilgore. He takes off his hat, 
               reaches in, and pulls out his helmet, puts it on.

               WHAT THEY SEE:

               The PBR being airlifted up by the helicopter.

               BACK TO KILGORE'S HELICOPTER

               Kilgore picks up some gloves and starts to put them on as he 
               crosses to the gunner by the helicopter.

               Typical quiet Vietnamese coastal village, rather large, built 
               along the beach and trees with rice paddies behind. Sampans 
               are pulled into a cove where the are being unloaded. We SEE

               working there.

               A teacher and little girl come out into the courtyard, quickly 
               followed by other students pouring from the schoolhouse in 
               the background. A North Vietnamese soldier runs in to the 
               teacher, who then turns back to the children. The soldier 
               waves to the children to get out of the area.

               gathering children together. Peasants run through as the

               remains, an older girl runs back to get him and run after 
               the others.

               Soon the village is buzzing with activity. Trenches are used 
               to pass weapons and ammunitions, young V.C. -- both men and 
               women. N.V.A. regulars rush along the trenches to take their

               EXT. THE COURTYARD - DAY

               As a medevac helicopter comes down landing by the smoke.  
               They carry the wounded G.I. into the helicopter.

               Frantic Americans push the two older Vietnamese into the 
               medevac ship for questioning. A YOUNG VIETNAMESE WOMAN 
               suddenly rushes out from one of the buildings, making a fuss 
               about the older Vietnamese. Then she throws her coolie hat 
               into the open helicopter door.

               It swerves down. We can SEE the disaster as well as the three 
               Vietnamese running away. It ROARS down, the machine gunner 
               FIRING.

               The Vietnamese are mowed down.

                         enemy down there.

               The LOH swerves past the tree line taking sniper FIRE and 
               finally a dead-on HIT. It swerves around in circles, black 
               smoke coming from it, cascading toward the ground.

               Copters fire at the bridge. Smoke and debris fly upward.  
               Geysers of water almost obscure it. The bridge is destroyed, 
               the village burns in the background.

               EXT. BEACH - DAY

               Kilgore's copter kicks up a cloud of dust as it sets down. 
               Kilgore pop's out, followed by Lance and other officers and 
               strides across the beach looking out toward the sea.

                                     SOLDIER (O.S.)
                         Incoming!

               They all dive except Kilgore; he's watching a big set. The 
               shell EXPLODES in the water about a hundred yards away, 
               sending up a geyser of spray. Kilgore is unmoved. The others 
               get up and join him.

                                     MAJOR
                         This L.Z. is still pretty hot, sir. 
                         Maybe you ought to surf somewhere 
                         else.

                         You're from goddamn New Jersey!

               He whistles Mike and Johnny over, who look like they're ready 
               to hit the dirt again as explosions go off around them.

                                     KILGORE
                         I wanna see how rideable that stuff

                         You wanna surf, soldier?

               They nod "yes" meekly.

                                     KILGORE
                         That's good son, because you either 
                         surf or fight. That clear?

               They turn and leave. Kilgore grabs an M16 from one of the 
               guards-they all think he's going to shoot the surfers or 
               someone-they run back uneasy.

                                     KILGORE

                         And bring a board Lance.

               He cocks the weapon-Lance looks around uneasily.

               He starts away.

               A shell screams over-they all hit the dirt except Kilgore. 
               It explodes, throwing sand through the air. Kilgore leans 
               down yelling over the noise.

               with blood, carrying a bloody baby. She is trying to offer

                         you do your stuff out there.

               Jets break the trees, we HEAR the EXPLOSIONS of 20mm CANNONS, 
               and then the entire tree line ERUPTS INTO FIRE with an immense 
               amount of napalm.

               Kilgore stands there, hands on hips, looking at the burning 
               jungle in the distance.

                                     KILGORE
                         You smell that? Do you smell that?

                         What?

                         Napalm, son. Nothing else in the 
                         world smells like that.
                              (crouches down)
                         I love the smell of napalm in the 
                         morning. You know, one time we had a 
                         hill bombed for twelve hours... and 
                         when it was all over, I walked up. 
                         We didn't find one of them, not one 
                         stinking dink body. The smell, you 
                         know that gasoline smell? The whole 
                         hill -- smelled like -- victory.

               He looks of nostalgically. A shell comes in and HITS in the 
               background. Willard and the soldiers react; Kilgore ignores 
               it.

                         Someday this war's gonna end.

               A tremendous sadness enveloping him. The he stands up and 
               walks off. Willard turns and looks toward him. He understands 
               what the colonel is saying to him.

               Suddenly he senses something. He stops, lifts his hand-then 
               licks his fingers and puts then in the air.

               Willard calmly goes about picking up Lance's clothes as 
               Kilgore apologizes to Lance for the conditions.

                                     KILGORE

               Kilgore is left frantic on the beach with his megaphone.

                         wait twenty minutes! Fuck!

               Willard and Lance run like hell toward the PBR in the 
               distance. In his frustration, Kilgore throws the megaphone 
               in the air and wanders off.

               AT THE PBR

               The crew help Willard and Lance climb onto the boat. Suddenly 
               Willard sees something and stops. In a pile of equipment 
               that the Hueys left are two surfboards. Willard looks at 
               them.

                                     WILLARD
                              (to PBR)

               All the soldiers at the copter duck and during that moment, 
               Willard snatches the colonel's surfboard. A soldier tries to 
               stop him.

                                     SOLDIER

                         Get the fuck off me! It's mine!

               He rushes back to the boat, handing the board up to Clean, 
               and scampers aboard. Clean stuffs the board in the stern. 
               The boat turns, ENGINES RUNNING HARD AND ROARS OFF toward 
               the deeper water of the river.

               The SOUND of the helicopter gets closer... and an 
               indistinguishable language on a loudspeaker. Lance gathers 
               his bucket and soap and jumps up on the PBR.

                         Don't worry Lance, he won't follow 
                         us too far.

                         What makes you say that?

                                     WILLARD
                         You think that Cav colonel wants 
                         everyone up river to know we stole 
                         his board?

                                     LANCE
                         I didn't steal it!

               Willard laughs, lights up a cigarette.

                                     CHIEF
                         Captain? Just how far up this river 
                         are we going?

                                     WILLARD
                         That's classified, Chief. I can't 
                         tell you. We're going up pretty far.

                                     CLEAN
                         Is it gonna be hairy?

                                     WILLARD
                         I don't know, kid. Yeah, probably.

                                     CHIEF
                         You like it like that, Captain? When 
                         it's hot, hairy?

                                     WILLARD
                         Fuck.
                              (a beat)
                         Maybe you'll get a chance to know 
                         what the fuck you are in some factory 
                         in Ohio.

               Chef steps forward with a plastic bucket.

                                     CHEF
                         Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go get those 
                         mangoes now, okay?

                                     CHIEF
                         Take somebody with you.

                                     WILLARD
                         I'll go with him.

               He turns and follows Chef off the PBR. They climb up the 
               bank, away from the boat, into the jungle.

               EXT. JUNGLE - MEDIUM VIEW - DUSK

               Chef and Willard cautiously walk through the dark underbrush. 
               We SEE fragments of them, LOSE then occasionally, and just 
               MOVE through the jungle. WE HEAR this conversation throughout:

                                     WILLARD
                         Chef?

                                     CHEF
                         Yes, sir.

                                     WILLARD
                         How come they call you that?

                                     CHEF
                         Call me what, sir?

                                     WILLARD
                         Chef. 'Cause you like mangoes and 
                         stuff?

                                     CHEF
                         No, sir. I'm a real chef. I'm a 
                         saucier.

                                     WILLARD
                         Saucier?

                                     CHEF
                         Yes, sir. See, I come from New 
                         Orleans. I was raised to be a saucier. 
                         A great saucier.

                                     WILLARD
                         What's a saucier?

                                     CHEF
                         We specialize in sauces. Gotta be a 
                         mango tree here somewhere... Then, I 
                         was supposed to go to Paris, to the 
                         Escoffier School. But then I got 
                         orders for my physical.

               As they move deeper into the jungle.

                                     CHEF
                         Well, I joined the navy. Heard they 
                         had better food. Cook school, that 
                         did it.

                                     WILLARD
                         Oh, yeah? How's that?

               Chef puts down his bucket and rifle, takes a leak. Willard 
               takes a few steps farther in the jungle and then sits by him 
               on a log.

                                     CHEF
                         You don't wanna hear about that. 
                         They lined us up in front of a hundred 
                         yards of prime rib. All of us, you 
                         know, looking at it? Magnificent. 
                         Magnifique. Next thing, they're 
                         throwing the meat into these big 
                         cauldrons.

               Willard has heard something in the jungle during this 
               explanation. He becomes alert.

                                     CHEF
                         All of it. Boiling it. I looked 
                         inside, man, it was turning grey. I 
                         couldn't fucking believe that one! 
                         That's when I applied for radioman's 
                         school, but they --

               Chef looks up, seeing Willard standing a distance away, poised 
               with his rifle. Willard signals to him to come cautiously. 
               He motions to Chef to move with him, each covering the other. 
               They walk a few yards from where they have heard something 
               move.

                                     CHEF
                         What is it? Charlie?

               MEDIUM SHOT - PANNING - WILLARD

               moving through the jungle cautiously, he is comfortable in 
               this environment. He signals and directs his way very 
               expertly, giving silent instructions to Chef on how to move 
               with him.

               They seem to have the intruder localized and proceed very 
               quietly toward where he is.

               MEDIUM SHOT - THE ELEPHANT GRASS - WILLARD AND CHEF

               Suddenly the grass folds almost to Willard, and a huge TIGER 
               leaps out at them, snarling magnificently. They fire wildly, 
               emptying their clips.

                                     CHEF
                         It's a motherfucking tiger! It's a 
                         tiger, man! A tiger!

               He turns and bolts through the jungle, as scared as a man 
               can be.

                                     CHEF
                         Motherfucking tiger!

               Willard backs out of the clearing, covering the bushes and 
               runs, scared out of his head as well. They fire their M16s 
               indiscriminately running back to the boat, screaming.

               FULL SHOT - THE BOAT

               The crew is armed. They've heard the screaming. Lance has 
               the twin fifties pointed into the jungle. Chef comes screaming 
               out of the brush. Throws his rifle in the boat and dives 
               headfirst after it.

                                     CHIEF
                         Battle stations. Lance, up front. 
                         Get on your sixty, Clean.

                                     CHEF
                         Fucking tiger!

                                     CLEAN
                         Let's go!

                                     CHEF
                         Chief, you were right. Never get out 
                         of the fucking boat!

                                     CHIEF
                         Clean, bring that 60 forward.

                                     CHEF
                         Never get out of the boat! I gotta 
                         remember! Gotta remember! Never get 
                         out of the boat!

                                     CHIEF
                         How many is it?

                                     CHEF
                         A fucking tiger!

                                     CLEAN
                         What?

                                     CHEF
                         Tiger!

                                     CHIEF
                         Tiger?

                                     CHEF
                              (going berserk)
                         I'm done with this goddamn fucking 
                         shit! You can kiss my ass on the 
                         county square, because I'm fucking 
                         bugging out! I don't fucking need 
                         it! I didn't get on the goddamn A 
                         train for this kind of shit! All I 
                         wanted to do is fucking cook! I just 
                         wanted to learn to fucking cook, 
                         man!

               The others try to calm him down.

                                     LANCE
                         You're all right. You're all right.

                                     CHEF
                         All right. It's gonna be all right. 
                         It's gonna be all right. Never get 
                         out of the boat. 'Bye, tiger! 'Bye 
                         tiger!

               The boat pulls away as he continues ranting about the tiger.

               CLOSE ON WILLARD

               Looking back into the jungle.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Never get out of the boat. Absolutely 
                         goddamn right. Unless you were going 
                         all the way.

               EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - NIGHT

               The PBR moves down the dark, silent river through the night.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Kurtz got off the boat. He split 
                         from the whole fucking program. How 
                         did that happen? What did he see 
                         here that first tour?

               Willard lights a cigarette and holds a flashlight as he looks 
               at the dossier. As he speaks we see CLOSE SHOTS on the 
               newspaper articles, letters, and photos.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Thirty-eight fucking years old. If 
                         you joined the green berets, there 
                         was no way you'd ever get above 
                         colonel. Kurtz knew what he was giving 
                         up. The more I read and began to 
                         understand, the more I admired him. 
                         His family and friends couldn't 
                         understand it. And they couldn't 
                         talk him out of it. He had to apply 
                         three times, and he put up with a 
                         ton of shit, but when he threatened 
                         to resign, they gave it to him. The 
                         next youngest guy in his class was 
                         half his age. They must've thought 
                         he was some far-out man humping it 
                         over the course. I did it when I was 
                         nineteen, it damn near wasted me. A 
                         tough motherfucker. He finished it. 
                         He could've gone for general, but he 
                         went for himself instead.

               MEDIUM VIEW - OF THE PBR

               gliding up the river. Chef is sitting in the back of the 
               boat, writing a letter. He is using a flashlight to see by, 
               as he reads to himself outloud as he writes.

                                     CHEF
                              (writing letter)
                         Dear Eva. Today was really a new 
                         one. Almost got eaten by a fucking 
                         tiger. Really un-fucking believable, 
                         you know? We're taking this guy, 
                         Captain Willard, up river, but he 
                         hasn't told us yet where we're taking 
                         him...

               Clean is at the helm, singing to himself, the Chief is 
               sleeping. Willard looks at an article about Kurtz in a 
               magazine.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         October, 1967. On special assignment, 
                         Kontoom Province, Two-Corps... Kurtz 
                         staged Operation Archangel with 
                         combined local forces. Rated a major 
                         success. He received no official 
                         clearance. He just thought it up and 
                         did it. What balls. They were going 
                         to nail his ass to the floorboards 
                         for that one. But after the press 
                         got a hold of it, they promoted him 
                         to full colonel instead. Oh, man, 
                         the bullshit piled up so fast in 
                         Vietnam, you needed wings to stay 
                         above it.

               Suddenly, from around a bend, the boat is illuminated by a 
               strange artificial light. Lance and Chief are awakened. 
               Willard reacts as he looks out toward the light. It becomes 
               brighter and brighter as they move closer.

               WHAT THEY SEE:

               EXT. HAU PHAT - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

               The PBR goes by the base, tents, oil drums, sandbagged 
               bunkers, etc., but the biggest surprise of all is a huge 
               oval STAGE built in the water, lit by banks of lights. 
               Preparations for some sort of show are in progress.

               They all react, incredulous, as the PBR pulls into the bay 
               and up to the dock.

                                     CLEAN
                         This sure enough is a bizarre sight 
                         in the middle of all this shit.

                                     CHIEF
                              (to Willard)
                         Expecting us this time?

                                     WILLARD
                         Damned if I know.

               It looks like an amusement park, with strings of lights, 
               etc.

                                     CHEF
                         Jesus Christ...

               EXT. SUPPLY DOCK AREA - NIGHT

               The supply docks of this base. Tents, oil drums, sandbagged 
               bunkers, helicopters, tanks, guns, and men. As they walk, 
               Chef and Clean stop a moment and look at a group of 
               motorcycles. The dock is crowded with all kinds of goods, 
               freezers, refrigerators, etc., all the nonessentials for 
               fighting a war.

                                     CLEAN
                         Hau Phat. You ever been up here 
                         before, Chef?

                                     CHEF
                         I bet you could score up here.

                                     CLEAN
                         Yo, man, check out the bikes, man.  
                         Yamaha, Suzuki.

                                     CHEF
                         That's a good one.

                                     CLEAN
                         Yeah, Sukiyaki.

               Willard moves on, Chef and Clean catch up with him.

                                     CLEAN
                         This must be the guy.

                                     WILLARD
                         Right over there.

               Willard and the men approach a harried SERGEANT at a 
               requisition desk, filling out papers, answering questions, 
               shouting out orders to the frenetic activity around him. 
               There are soldiers scurrying back and forth, loading and 
               unloading supplies. They constantly interrupt the sergeant 
               with their questions.

               Chef and Clean stop in front of the sergeant.

                                     CLEAN
                         Three drums of diesel fuel, PBR-
                         Five...

                                     SERGEANT
                         Move! We have one hour, that's all!
                              (to Clean)
                         What do you want?

                                     CHEF
                         Can I get some Panama Red?

                                     SERGEANT
                         Panama Red? Yeah, I'll get you Panama 
                         Red.

                                     CLEAN
                         Sergeant.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Destination?

                                     CLEAN
                         I don't have a destination.

                                     SERGEANT
                         You can't get a goddamn thing without 
                         a destination.

               Willard steps in.

                                     WILLARD
                         Sergeant.

                                     SERGEANT
                         I need a destination. I can't do a 
                         goddamn thing about it.

                                     WILLARD
                         Hey, Sarge, these guys are with me. 
                         Destination classified. I carry 
                         priority papers from Com-Sec 
                         Intelligence, II Corps.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Listen, sir, it's a real big night --
                              (to another soldier)
                         Eight dollars for that camera --

               With unexpected rage, Willard suddenly reaches up and grabs 
               the Sergeant by the collar, pulling him down across a table, 
               really frightening him. Everybody is quite surprised.

                                     WILLARD
                         Just give them some fuel.

                                     SERGEANT
                         You got it.

               Willard lets go of the sergeant, almost embarrassed for the 
               show of temper. The sergeant goes back behind his desk and 
               starts signing papers.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Listen, Captain... I'm really sorry 
                         about tonight. It's really bad around 
                         here. Just take this over to the man 
                         at the supply desk and you got it.

               He tears off a requisition and hands it to one of the trio.

                                     SERGEANT
                              (to crew)
                         Listen, would you guys like some 
                         press box seats for the show? You 
                         want those?  The show, man, out here. 
                         The bunnies.

                                     LANCE
                         The Playboy bunnies?

               The sergeant finally leaves the trio, grabs a bottle of 
               cognac, and moves to Willard. Hands him the bottle.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Hey, listen, Captain... on the house. 
                         No hard feelings.

               Willard looks down at the bottle in his hand and then up at 
               the stage.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The SOUND of ENGINES is heard. A HUEY and TWO LOCHES descend 
               from the clouds. The Loches hover and circle, while the Huey 
               descends onto the platform stage. There is a large black-and-
               white PLAYBOY INSIGNIA painted on the nose.

               EXT. STAGE - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

               The entire area around the stage and right up to the barbed 
               wire is mobbed with hundreds of seething American men. Some 
               of these boys have just gotten here, others have been in the 
               jungle for months. It's the Vietnam military version of a 
               happening. Guys from all walks of life, from the cities, 
               guys with flowers in their hair and peace signs around their 
               necks, other guys with their short-time sticks and war 
               medallions around their necks. Black G.I.s congregate together 
               with their clenched-fist black power medallions. There are 
               signs and posters and graffiti everywhere. Some guys have 
               guitars, everyone seems to have a camera. Rummaging, sitting, 
               waiting expectantly, before the enormous stage, which is 
               protected by rings of concertina wire, a moat, and M.P.s 
               every three feet at riot control positions. Many joints and 
               pipes are being passed around. Snapshots are being taken. It 
               has a strong resemblance to a love-in or even Woodstock. 
               Except that they're all in various degrees of combat fatigues, 
               and they're all men.

               CHEF, CLEAN, LANCE, WILLARD AND THE CHIEF move down an aisle 
               to their seats. It is through WILLARD'S EYES that we see 
               this spectacle, bad every so often we will see an enthusiastic 
               Lance, Chef, and Clean. The Chief remains noncommittal, and 
               somewhat bored. To the others, it's a wonder of wonders.

               Over by the dock, behind the chain-link fence, there is a 
               group of VIETNAMESE who have gathered to watch the show. 
               They have brought rice, food, etc. They will watch and react 
               throughout, along with the American soldiers who are standing 
               guard in front of them.

               VIEW ON THE STAGE

               The Playboy copter descends onto the stage. The door of the 
               Huey slides open and TWO YOUNG GREEN BERETS step out with 
               their M16s to varied CATCALLS. When this abates, a young and 
               extremely well-dressed man emerges. He is the epitome of the 
               Hollywood agent. He's informal, high-strung, and good at 
               what he does. His presence causes some stirring and occasional 
               shouts of "ripoff" from the men. He gets a microphone from 
               the stage, then walks to the front and addresses the men.

                                     AGENT
                         How you doing out there?
                              (beat and reaction)
                         I said how you doing out there?
                              (beat and reaction)
                         Wanna say hello to you from all of 
                         us up here, to all of you out there, 
                         who work so goddamn hard on Operation 
                         Brute Force. Hello, all you 
                         Paratroopers out there! And the 
                         Marines! And the Sailors! We wanna 
                         let you know that we're proud of 
                         you, 'cause we know how tough and 
                         how hard it's been! Yeah! And to 
                         prove it, we're gonna give you some 
                         entertainment we know you're gonna 
                         like!

               The band starts its rock 'n' roll amp, playing the Creedence 
               Clearwater Revival rendition of "Suzy Q".

                                     AGENT
                         Miss August, Miss Sandra Beatty! 
                         Miss Nay, Miss Terri Tersay! And the 
                         Playmate of the year, Miss Carrie 
                         Foster!

               Two very beautiful PLAYMATES in exotic, brief costumes come 
               out of the helicopter. They are TERRI and SANDRA, and they 
               start swaying to the music.

                                     SANDRA
                         Hello, out there!

               The two playmates jump down and dance to the front of the 
               stage. The G.I.s go crazy and the girls dance their erotic 
               dance. In the meantime. The two Green Berets at the helicopter 
               help out the PLAYMATE OF THE YEAR, CARRIE FOSTER.

               The Berets carry the Playmate out on their rifles to the 
               center of the stage, and put here down. She dances forward 
               and joins the other two girls and the front. Carrie is dressed 
               in a Western outfit. They all dance to "Suzy Q".

               VIEW OF THE CROWD

               Appropriately, they go wild.

                                     MARINE
                         I'm here, baby! I'm here!

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - THE AGENT

               Looking at little worried.

               ANGLE ON WILLARD AND THE CHIEF

               watching the spectacle. Willard takes a drink from the bottle 
               that was given to him by the supply sergeant.

               HIS POV

               The three Playmates going through all their gyrations.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD

               Reacting, shaking his head. Chef, Lance, and Clean all think 
               it's fantastic.

               VIEW ON THE CROWD

               Audience continues to react as the three Playmates sway and 
               hump. Fights are breaking out. Some of the G.I.s pull out 
               centerfolds of the three girls from under their uniforms.

                                     MARINE
                         Sign my centerfold!

               He leaps madly, climbing up on the stage. Other guys start 
               to follow him. The M.P.s try to stop them but to no avail.  
               Before you know it, a mba is storming the stage.

               VIEW ON AGENT

               Knows the show is over.

                                     AGENT
                              (to Pilot)
                         Start her up.
                              (to M.P.s)
                         Get the girls! Let's go!
                              (to crowd)
                         So long!

               The Playmates are helped back into the helicopter. The rotors 
               whine and the Huey lifts off just as the first of the 
               enthusiast mob reaches it. The agent sets off a smoke bomb 
               to disperse the crowd. Some guys are even hanging onto the 
               skids of the helicopter. They finally let go and fall into 
               the water below, as the helicopter flies away.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Charlie didn't get much U.S.O. He 
                         was dug in too deep or moving too 
                         fast. His idea of great R and R was 
                         cold rice, and a little rat meat. He 
                         had only two ways home-death, or 
                         victory.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. HAU PHAT - DAY

               As the PBR pulls away from the Hau Phat area, Willard looks 
               back at the clean-up operations, a helicopter hovers over 
               the littered area, shirtless men sweep and mop up the stage, 
               burn trash; others dismantle the floating lights.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         No wonder Kurtz put a weed up 
                         Command's ass. The war was being run 
                         by a bunch of four-star clowns, who 
                         were gonna end up giving the whole 
                         circus away.

               EXT. PBR - DAY

               Chief is steering the boat. Chef is looking at a Playboy 
               magazine centerfold of Terri.

                                     CHEF
                         You know, man, that was far fucking 
                         out. I collected every picture of 
                         her since she was Miss December.
                              (showing Clean the 
                              centerfold)
                         Hey, Clean, look at that. She was 
                         here, man! I even wrote to the cunt. 
                         She didn't write me back.

                                     CLEAN
                         You can get really hung up on these 
                         broads, like that cat in the delta.

                                     CHEF
                         Yeah. What cat?

               As Clean talks, Chef tears the centerfold out of his Playboy, 
               then kneels down by the bulkhead in back of the wheel. He 
               tapes the centerfold onto the bulkhead.

                                     CLEAN
                         The one that went up for murder? He 
                         was an army Sergeant. This cat, he 
                         really dug his Playboy, man.

               As he continues, Lance moves to the back of the boat and 
               starts unwrapping the plastic from his new water skis.

                                     CLEAN
                         I mean, this cat, when the thing 
                         arrived, he was there to meet it, 
                         man!

                                     CHEF
                              (indicating photo)
                         Look at these beautiful fucking jugs, 
                         man!

                                     CLEAN
                         Anyway, he was working ARVN patrols, 
                         had one of them cocky gook asshole 
                         lieutenants, and one day the gook 
                         took his magazine and wouldn't give 
                         it back! Cat said "Gimme my magazine 
                         back!" Good said, "You shut up. I 
                         have you court-martialed", you know?

                                     CHEF
                         Typical fucking ARVN, man.

                                     CLEAN
                         The gook went too far.

                                     CHIEF
                         Chef, take the wheel.

               Chef takes the wheel of the boat as the Chief moves back and 
               starts brushing his teeth. Lance continues to unwrap his 
               skis.

                                     CLEAN
                         Sticking pinholes and mutilating the 
                         centerfold and shit like that. And 
                         the sergeant said, "You better not 
                         do that to her. You leave your shitty 
                         little gook hands off of that girl!"  
                         Gook say, "Fuck you!" In Vietnamese, 
                         right? Sergeant, man, he just couldn't 
                         handle it no more. He just picked up 
                         his iron --

               He picks up an M16 rifle to demonstrate.

                                     CLEAN
                         -- flipped it to rock 'n' roll and 
                         boom! Gave that little zero a long 
                         burst straight through the Playboy 
                         mag. It blew his ass clear out off 
                         the dock. There wasn't no more 
                         lieutenant that day. That was it for 
                         his ass.

                                     CHEF
                         They burn him for it?

                                     CLEAN
                         The sergeant? Yeah, man. They stuck 
                         his ass in the L.B.J. It's too bad 
                         he didn't get no medals or nothing.

               He puts the rifle back in the rack. Disappears down the hole 
               of the ship. They all shake their heads at the cruel injustice 
               of life.

                                     CHEF
                         Fucking ARVN, man. They should've 
                         killed the fuck. Should've given 
                         that fucker a Silver Star. Bummer 
                         for the gook, though, ain't it?

               EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - DAY

               We HEAR a radio station playing. Willard is seated looking 
               through the dossier, documents from the C.I.A.

                                     RADIO HOST (OVER RADIO)
                         Good morning, Vietnam. I'm Army 
                         Specialist Zack Johnson on A.M.N.V. 
                         It's about eighty-two degrees in 
                         downtown Saigon right now, also very 
                         humid...

               Clean is standing on the front of the boat, he has a small 
               transistor radio in his hand.

                                     RADIO HOST (OVER RADIO)
                         ...and we have an important message 
                         for all G.I.s who are living offbase 
                         from the mayor of Saigon. He's like 
                         you to hand the laundry up indoors, 
                         instead of the windowsills. The major 
                         wants you to keep Saigon beautiful. 
                         And now, here's another blast from 
                         the past going out to Big Sam, who's 
                         all alone out there with the First 
                         Battalion, 35th Infantry, and 
                         dedicated by the Fire Team and their 
                         groovy C.O. The Rolling Stones, 
                         "Satisfaction."

               The music comes on, Clean starts dancing, keeping time to 
               "Satisfaction." The others cheer him.

                                     CHEF
                         Work out, Clean! Get down, bubba!
                              (to Lance)
                         Hang on, Lance!

               We SEE that Lance is water-skiing behind the PBR, waving to 
               the guys.

                                     CLEAN
                              (dancing)
                         Can you dig it, man? Can you dig it?
                              (to Chef)
                         I see you're right on target.
                              (to group)
                         Work out! Yeah! Yeah!

               The boat passes a Vietnamese fishing boat, capsizing it in 
               its wake.

               VIEW ON WILLARD

               He's found himself in a corner in the boat. He looks to the 
               front where Clean is moving and dancing to the MUSIC, to the 
               rear where Lance is water-skiing, and looks down to his 
               dossier, with its odd assortment of photographs, reports, 
               and letters.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         "Commitment and Counterinsurgency" 
                         by Walter E. Kurtz. "As long as our 
                         officers and troops perform tours of 
                         duty limited to one year, they will 
                         remain dilettantes in war, and 
                         tourists in Vietnam. As long as cold 
                         beer, hot food, rock 'n' roll, and 
                         all the other amenities remain 
                         expected norm, our conduct of the 
                         war will only gain impotence. We 
                         need fewer men, and better. If they 
                         were committed, this war could be 
                         won with a fourth of our present 
                         force."

               FULL SHOT - THE PBR CREW

               The Chief is at the helm. He takes off his sunglasses and 
               looks straight ahead, reacting.

               HIS POV:

               Two PBR's coming straight at them. The lead PBR is headed on 
               a collision course.

                                     CLEAN
                         Shit. Chicken time. You ain't 
                         shittin', bro. They're motherfuckers.

                                     LANCE
                         Who is that? What's going on?

               All are looking forward. The Chief grabs the loud-hailer.

                                     CHIEF
                              (over loud-hailer)
                         Is that you, Lazzaro?

                                     CHEF
                              (to Chief)
                         Don't chicken out.

               The lead PBR keeps coming on in a game of "chicken," the 
               rock music blaring from its speakers. Then it swerves at the 
               last possible moment and fishtails past. One of its CREWMEN 
               moons our crew. Lance, Chef, and Clean shout back and give 
               them the finger.

                                     LOUDSPEAKER
                         Chicken!

               The other PBR fishtails past also, causing a lot of turbulence 
               in the water. The crew gives our boys the finger, then one 
               of them throws a SMOKE BOMB. It lands on the canopy.

               The smoke bomb spews out its YELLOW SMOKE, and suddenly the 
               canopy catches on fire.

                                     CHIEF
                         Fire on the canopy!

               Chef grabs a fire extinguisher and tries to snuff the fire 
               out.

                                     CHEF
                         I got it! Get out of there!

               Chief keeps roaring down the river as the others continue to 
               fight the fire. Finally they get it out. Willard stands there, 
               dumbfounded, and reacting, as we:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - DAY

               The PBR continues down the river. Lance gives a handful of 
               palm leaves to Chef, who is sitting up on top of the canvas 
               roof, trying to patch up the hole that was caused by the 
               fire. Clean has a pair of drumsticks and is beating out a 
               drum rhythm, really getting into it.

               Willard studies the dossier; some photos and Vietnamese I.D. 
               cards.

                         Late summer, autumn 1968. Kurtz's 
                         patrol into the highlands is coming 
                         under frequent bush. The camp started 
                         falling apart. November. Kurtz orders 
                         assassinations of three Vietnamese 
                         men and one woman. Two of the men 
                         were colonels in the South Vietnamese 
                         Army. Enemy activity in his old sector 
                         dropped off to nothing. Guess he 
                         must have hit the right four people.

                         him back into the fold. And if he'd

                         ...like a god, and follow every order, 
                         however ridiculous.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         They lost him. He was gone. Nothing 
                         but rumors and random intelligence, 
                         mostly from captured V.C. The V.C. 
                         knew his name by now, and they were 
                         scared of him. He and his men were 
                         playing hit and run all the way into 
                         Cambodia.

               Clean's drum rhythm is annoying Willard. He puts a map back 
               into his dossier, rises, and looks at Clean, pissed, then 
               looks to the Chief.

                                     CHIEF
                         Clean.

               Clean stops drumming, moves away.

                                     WILLARD
                              (to Chief)
                         How long has that kid been on this 
                         boat?

                                     CHIEF
                         Seven months.

                                     WILLARD
                         He's really specializing in busting 
                         my balls.

                                     CHIEF
                         Very possibly, Captain, he thinks 
                         the same of you.

               Willard moves over to Chief.

                                     WILLARD
                         Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?

               ANGLE ON CLEAN

               Clean gives Willard the finger behind his back.

                                     CHIEF
                         I don't think. My orders say I'm not 
                         supposed to know where I'm taking 
                         this boat, so I don't. But one look 
                         at you and I know it's gonna be hot, 
                         wherever it is.

               Willard comes into the cabin, looks at the Chief.

                                     WILLARD
                         We're going up river, about seventy-
                         five clicks about the Do Lung bridge.

               The Chief reacts, figuring it out almost immediately.

                                     CHIEF
                         That's Cambodia, Captain.

                                     WILLARD
                         That's classified. We're not supposed 
                         to be in Cambodia, but that's where 
                         I'm going. You just get me close to 
                         my destination, and I'll cut you 
                         loose.

                                     CHIEF
                         All right, Captain.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - DAY

               The PBR moves down the river. Willard is studying the dossier, 
               holding a LETTER from Kurtz to his son.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                              (reading letter)
                         "Dear Son. I'm afraid that both you 
                         and your mother will have worried at 
                         not hearing from me during the past 
                         weeks, but my situation here has 
                         become a difficult one. I have been 
                         officially accused of murder by the 
                         army. The alleged victims were four 
                         Vietnamese double agents. We spent 
                         months uncovering then and 
                         accumulating evidence. When absolute 
                         proof was completed, we acted. We 
                         acted like soldiers. The charges are 
                         unjustified. They are, in fact, and 
                         under the circumstances of this 
                         conflict, quite completely insane."

               The boat moves past some DEAD AMERICAN PILOTS. Their bodies 
               are lying in the water, on the bank, and in the trees, all 
               torn apart and bloody. There is smoke and debris all around.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                              (continuing reading 
                              letter)
                         "In a war, there are many moments 
                         for compassion and tender action. 
                         There are many moments for ruthless 
                         action. What is often called ruthless, 
                         but may, in many circumstances, be 
                         only clarity. Seeing clearly what 
                         there is to be done, and doing it 
                         directly, quickly, awake.

               They come upon a burning helicopter, which has crashed in 
               one of the trees on the shore. This explains the dead American 
               bodies. The Chief picks up the radio phone, calling to 
               headquarters.

                                     CHIEF (OVER TAPE)
                         Request-dust off. Three, maybe four 
                         KIAs.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                              (continuing reading 
                              letter)
                         "I will trust you tell your mother 
                         what you choose about this letter. 
                         As for the charges against me, I am 
                         unconcerned. I am beyond their timid, 
                         lying morality, and so I am beyond 
                         caring. You have all my faith. Your 
                         loving father.

               CLOSE ON A SHADOWY PHOTO OF KURTZ

               The caption "Photo believed to be Col. W. E. Kurtz."

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RIVER OUTPOST - DAY

               It is a tremendous, tropical rainfall. The PBR pulls in toward 
               an American outpost that is being used as a forward medical 
               evacuation center. Various helicopter pads are seen but only 
               one helicopter -- the one painted with the Playboy bunny 
               logo that brought the girls to Hau Phat. The whole area is a 
               mess with mud and debris and looks deserted.

                                     WILLARD
                              (reacting)
                         Jesus.

                                     CHIEF
                         No wonder I couldn't get them on the 
                         radio.

                                     WILLARD
                         What a dump.

               Several soldiers in raincoats come out from a tent as the 
               PBR pulls up.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Hi there!

                                     WILLARD
                         How you doing?

                                     SOLDIER
                         That's a nice little boat you got 
                         there. Never seen one up here before.

                                     CHIEF
                         We called in a request for a medevac. 
                         You guys didn't receive it?

                                     SOLDIER
                         Medevac? No.

                                     CHIEF
                         We passed a downed Huey with some 
                         KIAs.

                                     SOLDIER
                         On your way here?

                                     CHIEF
                         Yeah.

                                     SOLDIER
                              (incredulous)
                         You going up this river?

                                     CHIEF
                         Way up.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Way up river? Forget it.

                                     CHIEF
                         Why?

                                     SOLDIER
                         We wanna send some people down river. 
                         Just forget it.

               They turn around and start to go back to their tents.

                                     CHEF
                              (to Willard)
                         What the fuck was that?

                                     CHIEF
                              (calling out)
                         We'll be back in a couple of days.

               The soldier looks at him as though he must be crazy.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Yeah, right, you'll be back.

               They return to the tent. Willard steps off the PBR.

                                     WILLARD
                         Chief?

                                     CHIEF
                         Yeah, Captain.

                                     WILLARD
                         See what you can do with that engine. 
                         I'm gonna have a look around. And 
                         don't leave without me.

               He walks up the muddy bank and through the deserted camp.  
               Half of it is blown down. The whole installation has the 
               look of a ghost town. TWO SOLDIERS approach, huddled in their 
               ponchos.

                                     WILLARD
                         Hey, solder, where's your C.O.?

                                     SOLDIER
                         Don't ask me, man.

               Willard wanders around the desolate place. Other soldiers 
               pass.

                                     WILLARD
                         Hey, guys, where's your C.O.?

                                     SOLDIER
                         He stepped on a land mine about two 
                         months ago. Got all blown to hell.

                                     WILLARD
                         Who's in charge here?

                                     SOLDIER
                         Charge? I don't know man. I'm just 
                         the night man. Just doing what I'm 
                         told. I'm just a working girl.

               He just giggles and turns off walking into the mud and rain.

                                     WILLARD
                              (to other soldier)
                         What about you, fella?

               The other soldier turns around smiling idiotically, and making 
               animal noises. He stumbles off after his friend.

               EXT. PBR - BY THE RIVER - DAY

               Lance, Chef, and Clean are sitting on the dock surrounded by 
               enormous pile of clothes, boots, all sorts of brand new junk, 
               seemingly abandoned. Chief remains with the boat. Clean is 
               working on Lance's M16.

                                     CLEAN
                         Lance, man, I'm telling you it's 
                         gonna jam. You mark my words.

                                     LANCE
                         Get off my back!

               Lance, in an unexplainable fit of temper, turns to Clean, 
               jumping on him and pulling him into the mud. Chef, seeing a 
               brawl, jumps into it as well. All wrestle in the mud.

               BACK TO WILLARD

               He hears a voice.

                                     AGENT
                         Hey, you!  Come here!

               Willard turns to see the Hollywood agent from the Hau Phat 
               show under the flap of a large tent, hiding from the rain, 
               waving Willard to come over.

               His clothes are the same he wore at the Hau Phat show but 
               wet and dirty. He motions Willard over to him.

                                     AGENT
                         Come here. Is that your boat? Come 
                         on inside.

                                     WILLARD
                         What do you want?

                                     AGENT
                         Come on inside, I want to talk to 
                         you. Come on. Get out of the rain.

               BACK TO THE CREW IN THE MUD

               Rolling around fighting, slapping mud on each other. It's as 
               though there is a lingering madness that infects anyone who 
               visits this place.

                                     CHIEF
                         Come on, cut the shit. Come on.

               BACK TO WILLARD AND THE AGENT

                                     AGENT
                         How you doing, Captain? I want you 
                         to meet some people.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CREW AT THE PBR, STILL FIGHTING IN THE MUD

               Willard approaches the group. He looks down at them as they 
               sprawl in the mud.

                                     WILLARD
                         Hey, guys. Hey, fellas. Guys?

               They don't respond, but continue their wild free-for-all in 
               the junk and mud.

                                     WILLARD
                         I just made a deal with people from 
                         Hau Phat. I negotiated two barrels 
                         of fuel for a couple of hours with 
                         the bunnies.

               They stop fighting instantly. Willard walks toward the boat.  
               The group of them run after him.

                                     CHEF
                         You shittin' me?

                                     WILLARD
                         No, I'm not.
                              (to crew)
                         Grab a couple of barrels and get up 
                         to that big tent. Come on!

               VIEW ON THE CHIEF

               He is not jubilant about this news.

                                     CHIEF
                         Captain. You're giving away fuel for 
                         a Playmate of the month?

                                     WILLARD
                         No. Playmate of the Year, Chief.
                              (he takes a drink 
                              from a bottle)

                                     CHIEF
                         Captain, we get in a fire fight and 
                         run out of fuel, I want you to tell 
                         me how she was.

                                     WILLARD
                         I made a deal for all of us, Chief.  
                         How about you?

                                     CHIEF
                         You got some mamas in there?

                                     WILLARD
                         Some what?

                                     CHIEF
                              (laughing)
                         Forget it, Captain. I'll stay with 
                         the boat.

               Chief moves to the engine, with Lance's M16.

                                     LANCE
                         Hey, Captain, give me a hand!

               Willard helps Lance with the fuel drum, and they exit, leaving 
               Chief alone on the boat.

               EXT. PLAYBOY HELICOPTER - RAIN - DAY

               It is still raining. The PLAYBOY HELICOPTER is parked by the 
               river. Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, and we can make out two figures 
               in the front seat.

                                     CHEF (O.S.)
                         You know, I got every one of your 
                         pictures...

               INT. PLAYBOY HELICOPTER - RAIN - DAY

               It is Chef and Terri. He has on his rain gear and is 
               struggling to get it off. Terri is holding a white BIRD in 
               her hands and there are TWO MORE perched on their back seat.

                                     CHEF
                         I got the centerfold, the Playmate's 
                         Review, the Playmate of the Year 
                         runoff. I even got the calendar. 
                         Hey, oiseau! How come you got a bird?

                                     TERRI
                         I used to be the bird girl at Busch 
                         Gardens.

                                     CHEF
                         Busch Gardens?

                                     TERRI
                         Yeah, I used to train birds there.

               He reacts as he rises, struggling to get off his rain pants.

                                     CHEF
                         You are Miss December, aren't you?

                                     TERRI
                         Miss May.

               EXT. HOSPITAL UNIT - RAIN - DAY

               Lance and Carrie are inside one of the hospital musk units.  
               She is lying back on one of the beds, and Lance is trying to 
               pull her boots off. Carrie's portfolio and pictures are spread 
               around the bed with some of her fan mail.

                                     CARRIE
                         Is it coming?

               BACK TO CHEF AND CARRIE

                                     CHEF
                         Miss December has black hair.

                                     TERRI
                         It's over there.

               She points to the back-seat of the Huey, to a black wig on a 
               stand. Chef reacts as he looks at it. She is still preoccupied 
               with the bird.

                                     TERRI
                         He's not one of my regular birds.
                              (to bird)
                         Come on, baby. Snatch your cracker. 
                         Come here.

               BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

               Lance is kneeling next to Carrie, starting to make his move. 
               He opens her blouse, exposing her breasts.

                                     CARRIE
                         Being Playmate of the Year is the 
                         loneliest experience I can imagine. 
                         It's like you try to express your 
                         feelings to someone, and show them 
                         your heart...

               BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

                                     CHEF
                         Yeah, I'd love to see your bird act, 
                         but would you mind just putting this --
                         would you just mind putting this wig 
                         on for me, please?

               He picks up the wig from the stand. Terri turns and moves 
               back to the rear seat.

               BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

               He moves to her makeup case.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...and there's this glass wall between 
                         you, this invisible glass, and they 
                         can see your mouth moving.

               BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

               She is seated next to him in the back-seat of the helicopter.  
               He puts the black wig on her.

                                     TERRI
                         I used to train birds for at least 
                         two years at Busch Gardens.

                                     CHEF
                         This was cascading over your shoulder.
                              (her blouse)
                         This was open here.

               BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

               Lance is putting barrettes in her hair.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...but they can't hear what you're 
                         saying.

               BACK TO TERRI AND CHEF

               He has opened her blouse and is trying to position her.

                                     TERRI
                         ...I used to train then to stand on 
                         their head, fly upside down, and 
                         ride little bicycles...

                                     CHEF
                         Your right hand was over there...

               Suddenly Clean appears at the back window of the helicopter, 
               carrying an open black umbrella to shield himself from the 
               rain. He bangs on the window.

                                     CLEAN
                         Hey, Chef!

                                     CHEF
                         Get out of there, man!

               Clean continues to pound on the side of the helicopter.  
               Chef reacts on the inside.

                                     CHEF
                         Later! Later! Give me fifteen minutes.

               BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

               Lance puts some of the green makeup on Carrie.

                                     CARRIE
                         You can never really make them hear 
                         what you're trying to say...

               BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

               Trying to position her.

                                     CHEF
                         You were kind of bending. Yeah, your 
                         ass was just kind of...

               By this time Clean has climbed up on the roof of the 
               helicopter, he leans over and looks in at Chef and Terri 
               through the front window, banging on it with his umbrella.

                                     CHEF
                         Hey man, fuck off! Fifteen minutes!

               BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

               He is lying her back on the bed.

                                     CARRIE
                         That's why I tried so desperately to 
                         show somebody that I had some talent.

               BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

               Chef fixes her shirt.

                                     TERRI
                         Little baby Macaws. Have you ever 
                         seen a baby Macaw? They're beautiful.

               Clean is now looking in through the window of the door.  
               They react to him.

                                     CHEF
                              (to Clean)
                         Come on, man, take off!

                                     CLEAN
                         I got my rights, man!

               BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

               He puts more makeup on her, as she continues to talk.

                                     CARRIE
                         They make you do things that you 
                         don't want to do. Like this picture 
                         here.

               She opens the portfolio that she has been hanging on to. We 
               SEE a picture of her in the nude. Lance looks at it and 
               reacts. Then she resumes talking.

                                     CARRIE
                         I started feeling repulsed with 
                         myself...

               BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

                                     CHEF
                         You were just kind of bending forward, 
                         you ass kind of out.

                                     TERRI
                         I love training birds...

                                     CHEF
                         That's it.

                                     TERRI
                         ...I really do.

               Chef finally has her posed perfectly.

                                     CHEF
                         That's it! Viola! Beautiful.

               We realize that he was trying to get her to pose exactly as 
               she was in the centerfold of the Playmate of the Year he 
               taped up on the PBR.

                                     CHEF
                         You know, I can't believe it. Me, J. 
                         Hicks. I can't believe I'm really 
                         here, you know.

               BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

               He is caressing her face.

                                     CARRIE
                         ...Maybe I'm unfit to have a 
                         relationship with a beautiful, 
                         innocent boy.

               BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

                                     CHEF
                         Just think, if it hadn't been for 
                         the Vietnam War, I'd never would've 
                         met you, Miss December.

                                     TERRI
                         Miss May.

               BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

                                     CARRIE
                         I wish I could find just one person 
                         that could share my point of view.

               BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

               They look at each other for a beat, then they both come 
               unglued. He starts stripping the clothes off her, laying her 
               back on the seat, kissing her breasts, etc.

                                     TERRI
                         You kiss like a bird! Oh, God! Kiss 
                         me!

                                     CHEF
                         I love birds!

               BACK TO LANCE AND CARRIE

               Clean appears at the window. He looks in at them. Carrie 
               turns and sees him, she jumps from the bed, panicked, and 
               moves over by a couple of metal COFFIN containers. Clean 
               bursts into the room as Carrie knocks one of the coffins 
               over. The lid pops open, revealing a NAKED DEAD SOLDIER 
               inside, full of bullet holes. Carrie screams.

               BACK TO CHEF AND TERRI

               Making passionate, enthusiastic love.

                                     TERRI
                         Like a bird! Take me like a bird! 
                         Fly baby! What are you doing?

                                     CHEF
                         I can fly like an eagle!

                                     TERRI
                         Like an eagle, baby! Cock it to me! 
                         Oh, you drive me crazy!

               BACK TO CARRIE, LANCE AND CLEAN

               Clean is gone. Lance is sitting next to Carrie, comforting 
               her. She is still distraught over seeing the dead body.

                                     CARRIE
                         Lance, that was somebody's son... 
                         Lance, there were things that they 
                         made me do, that I didn't want to 
                         do. But they said, "Pull the ribbons 
                         between your legs," and I didn't 
                         want to do it. But they said that 
                         was what was expected of me, that 
                         what people wanted to see.

               Lance reacts, then kisses her. He starts taking off her 
               blouse. Clean appears at the broken window behind them. He 
               sticks his head in and looks down at them, watching, waiting 
               for his turn. Carrie breaks the embrace and looks up at Clean.

                                     CARRIE
                         Who are you?

                                     CLEAN
                         I'm next, ma'am.

               Carrie reacts as we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. RIVER - PBR - DAY

               The crew are all on the PBR. Clean is at the back attempting 
               to shave. Chef is sitting in back busy cooking up one of his 
               specialties on top of the engine, giving Clean a hard time 
               about the girls. The Chief is at the helm, a little sore at 
               what's happening to his crew.

                                     CHEF
                              (to Clean)
                         Well, I didn't know you never got no 
                         pussy!

                                     CLEAN
                         Shut the fuck up!

                                     CHEF
                         Sure sorry about that. If I had known, 
                         I would have taken you to New Orleans. 
                         Teach you some of the moves.

                                     CHIEF
                         Lay off, Chef!

               Willard studies the shadowy photo of Kurtz we saw earlier, 
               as Chef teases Clean in the background.

                                     CHEF
                         Cherry boy, Cherry boy.

                                     CLEAN
                         You're fucking dumb!

                                     CHEF
                         We'll go to New Orleans. I'll get 
                         you fixed up, you prick.

                                     CHIEF
                         Lay off, Chef.

                                     CLEAN
                         You're the only prick I see around 
                         here. If I wanna play with a prick, 
                         I'll play with my own.

                                     CHEF
                         You wouldn't know what to do with 
                         it!

               VIEW ON LANCE

               Ignoring all this. He is painting his face with brown and 
               green camouflage greasepaint. It is quite ornate-almost 
               psychedelic. He holds a compact in his hand.

                                     CHIEF
                         Chef, I said lay off! Knock it off! 
                         Give him a break! What do you think 
                         I said? And give your jaws a rest. 
                         And this ain't the army! You are a 
                         sailor. So get out of that frizzly 
                         army-looking shirt and stop smoking 
                         that dope, you hear me?

               He looks back to Lance.

                                     CHIEF
                         Lance, what's with all the green 
                         paint?

                                     LANCE
                         Camouflage.

                                     CHIEF
                         How's that?

                                     LANCE
                         So they can't see you. They're 
                         everywhere. Chief.

               The Chief reacts... what the hell can he say.

                                     CHIEF
                         Uh-huh. I want you to stay awake up 
                         there, man. You got a job to do.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE PBR - DAY

               The Chief steers the PBR up river and around a bend. He sees 
               something ahead, shouts to the crew.

                                     CHIEF
                         Sampan off the port bow. Sampan off 
                         the port bow. Let's take a look.

               POV VIEW

               A SAMPAN, heading down-river, riding low in the water.

               BACK TO PBR CREW

               Everybody on the crew has reacted, as the Chief continues to 
               bark orders.

                                     CHIEF
                         Lance, bring them in. Clean, on the 
                         60. Chef, get a 16. Clean, get on 
                         that 60!

               Lance jumps up from his hammock, grabs his M16. Clean shuts 
               off his radio, jumps up and moves to the M60 machine gun.

               By this time Willard has moved up next to the Chief, wondering 
               what the hell is going on.

                                     WILLARD
                         What's up, Chief?

                                     CHIEF
                         A junk boat, Captain. We're gonna 
                         take a routine check.

                                     WILLARD
                         Let's forget routine now, and let 
                         them go.

                                     CHIEF
                         These boats are running supplies in 
                         this delta, Captain. I'm gonna take 
                         a look.

                                     WILLARD
                         Chief, my mission's got priority 
                         here. Hell, you wouldn't even be in 
                         this part of the river, if it wasn't 
                         for me.

                                     CHIEF
                         Until we reach your destination, 
                         Captain, you're just on for the ride.

               Willard realizes that this is a ploy by the Chief to establish 
               his authority. Nothing is going to stop him.

               ANOTHER ANGLE-TO INCLUDE SAMPAN AND PBR

               The PBR slides alongside the sampan. THREE NERVOUS VIETNAMESE 
               MEN and ONE YOUNG WOMAN look up from the baskets of rice, 
               mangoes, fish, etc.

                                     CHIEF
                         All right, come on, let's bring it 
                         over. Look in that forward hooch. 
                         Bring the people out of there.

               By this time the third man has crossed forward and joined 
               the others.

                                     CHEF
                         Hurry up, motherfuckers! Move it!  
                         Can couc!

               They hand their ID cards to Chef.

                                     CHIEF
                         Keep your eyes open, Clean.

                                     CLEAN
                              (on the machine gun)
                         I got you Chief.

               Willard just sits down, resigned to this show of the Chief's 
               authority.

               Chef looks at them and nods his approval. He hands them to 
               Chief.

                                     CHIEF
                         Board it and search it.

                                     CHEF
                         There ain't nothing on it, Chief.

                                     CHIEF
                         Board it and search it.

                                     CHEF
                         Just baskets and ducks. Bananas. 
                         There ain't nothing on it.

                                     CHIEF
                         Go on it and search it.

                                     CHEF
                         Just a goat. Some fish. Bunch of 
                         fucking vegetables.

               The Chief finally gets pissed off, he turns and screams at 
               Chef:

                                     CHIEF
                         Get on that boat!

                                     CHEF
                         There's nothing on it, man!

                                     CHIEF
                         Get on that boat!

               Chef starts down into the Vietnamese sampan. He is really 
               pissed off. He shoves the Vietnamese men out of the way.

                                     CHEF
                              (to man)
                         Move it, asshole.

               The Chief watches as Chef goes through the routine of 
               examining the sampan and what it carries. He is very nervous 
               as he looks in all the baskets.

                                     CHEF
                         Pigs! Mangoes! What's in the rice 
                         bag? Fucking rice!

                                     CHIEF
                         Well, look in there, Chef!

                                     CHEF
                         Fucking fish! More coconuts. Rice. 
                         Here's rice.

                                     CHIEF
                         What's in that vegetable basket?

               Chef moves deeper into the sampan. He looks at the Vietnamese 
               girl that is sitting on a yellow can.

                                     CHEF
                              (to girl)
                         Can couc! Come on! Get out of there.

               He grabs her and finally pulls her out of the interior of 
               the cabin. He moves it and starts looking around.

                                     CHIEF
                         Check that vegetable basket.

                                     CHEF
                         All right!

               One of the Vietnamese men starts to protest.

                                     CLEAN
                         Shut up, slope!

                                     CHEF
                         There ain't nothing in here.

                                     CHIEF
                         What's in the boxes? Look in that 
                         tin can. That rusty can.

                                     CHEF
                         Just fucking rice, that's all! There 
                         ain't nothing in it!

                                     CHIEF
                         Check that yellow can. She was sitting 
                         on it. What's in it?

               Chef starts for it. All of a sudden, the girl moves. Clean 
               opens up with the M60. She is blown apart, falling back on 
               the deck.

               In an instant, THEY ALL OPEN FIRE. One of the Vietnamese men 
               is blown apart into the water, and the others are gunned 
               down in their tracks.

               All of them continue to fire their rifles and guns wildly, 
               yelling obscenities. Willard has his .45 out but does not 
               shoot.

               Finally the Chief calls out to them.

                         Hold it! Hold it!

               They all stop firing, but Chef, Lance, and Clean are mumbling 
               hysterically.

                         Chef?

               Chef has moved to the yellow can that the Vietnamese girl 
               was sitting on. He opens the lid and checks what she had 
               hidden.

                         she was running for?

               He reaches inside of the can, and pulls out a PUPPY. They 
               all react.

                                     CHEF

               Lance grabs the dog from him, kicking Chef back. Chef throws 
               a mango at him.

                                     CHEF

                         want that?

               The Vietnamese girl, still alive and bleeding, moves behind 
               Chef.

                                     CHIEF
                         Chef, she's moving behind you. She's 
                         alive. Check her out.

               Chef turns and bends down to her.

               Clean jumps down into the sampan. He and Chef pick up the 
               girl and carry her to the edge of the boat.

                                     CHEF
                         She's not dead. She's moving.

                                     CHEF
                         She's hurt. She's bleeding.

                         to an ARVN.

               ANOTHER ANGLE ON TO INCLUDE WILLARD

               Willard looks at the girl and then to Chief.

                                     WILLARD
                         What are you talking about?

                                     CHIEF
                         We're taking her to some friendlies. 
                         She's wounded, she's not dead.

               Willard hold his .45. Looks down at Chef and the girl.

                                     WILLARD
                         Get out of there, Chef.

                                     CHIEF
                         The book says, Captain --

               Before anybody can react, Willard aims and SHOOTS THE GIRL 
               DEAD with his .45. She falls dead in Chef's arms.

                                     CHEF
                         Fuck you. Fuck them.

               Willard turns and looks at the Chief.

                                     WILLARD
                         I told you not to stop. Now let's 
                         go.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. THE RIVER - PBR - EVENING

               The boat moves up the river.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         It was a way we had over here of 
                         living with ourselves. We'd cut them 
                         in half with a machine gun, and give 
                         them a Band-Aid. It was a lie. And 
                         the more I saw of them, the more I 
                         hated liars. Those boys were never 
                         gonna look at me the same way again, 
                         but I felt like I knew one or two 
                         things about Kurtz, that weren't in 
                         the dossier.

               EXT. DO LUNG BRIDGE - THE PBR - RIVER - NIGHT

               The boat edges in toward a wrecked bridge in the distance.  
               Along the banks are sandbagged fortifications with the U.S. 
               soldiers. There is a bright fire burning uncontrolled in the 
               distance -- in fact there are several-flame and sparks from 
               welding on the bridge momentarily light up the night. There 
               is sporadic gunfire at O.S. snipers, and flares arc through 
               the sky above the bridge.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Do Lung bridge was the last army 
                         outpost on the Nung River. Beyond it 
                         there was only Kurtz.

                         acting kind of weird?

                         You know that last tab of acid I was

                                     CHEF
                         Yeah.

                         I dropped it.

                         You dropped acid? Far out.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               The Chief powers the boat forward, as Willard and Clean watch 
               in awe.

               Everywhere are wrecked boats, parts of jeeps sticking out of 
               the water-a smashed helicopter on the banks. The bridge is 
               in a state of siege. Mortars and rockets arc through the 
               night indiscriminately and rip through the nearby jungle. 
               Light automatic WEAPON FIRE is HEAD occasionally. The entire 
               scene is lit by Parachute flares.

               As the PBR edges forward, SOLDIERS run up through the water, 
               trying to get aboard. One soldier is carrying some luggage 
               and an M16. He splashes into the water, in a mad dash for 
               freedom.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Take me home! Goddamn you!

                                     CHIEF
                         Get away from this boat.

                                     SOLDIER #2
                         You'll get what you deserve!

               He and the others are left behind as the PBR continues 
               forward. Willard sees a young LIEUTENANT kneeling on a 
               platform that juts out into the water. He is holding a small 
               strobe light, trying to signal the PBR down. He is holding a 
               large mail bag and a pouch in the other hand.

               Willard motions toward the shore. The Chief turns the boat 
               towards the Lieutenant.

                                     CARLSON
                         Is there a Captain Willard on board? 
                         Captain Willard?

                                     WILLARD
                         Yeah! Who's that?

               As the boat crosses to a stop, Lance swings the spotlight 
               onto the Lieutenant.

                                     CARLSON
                         Lieutenant Carlson, sir.
                              (to Lance)
                         Get that light off me!

               Lance swings the light off him, as Willard squats down on 
               the bow of the boat.

                                     CARLSON
                         I was sent here from Nah Trang with 
                         these three days ago, sir. Expected 
                         you here a little sooner.

               He hands Willard a plastic bag with maximum security markings.  
               Willard takes it -- also a mail pouch.

                                     CARLSON
                         This is mail for the boat. You don't 
                         know how happy this makes me, sir.

                                     WILLARD
                         Why?

                                     CARLSON
                         Now I can get out of here, if I can 
                         find a way.

               He turns and splashes off into the darkness. Then stops and 
               looks back.

                                     CARLSON
                         You're in the asshole of the world, 
                         Captain!

               He salutes, then turns and moves away. Willard hops off the 
               side of the boat into the mud, moving up toward the shore.

                                     CHIEF
                         Captain, where you going?

                                     WILLARD
                         To see if I can find some fuel and 
                         get some information. Pick me up on 
                         the other side of the bridge.

                                     CHIEF
                              (to his men)
                         Somebody go with him.
                              (to Chef)
                         Chef.

               Chef doesn't move, not wanting to go. No one budges, then 
               Lance volunteers.

                                     LANCE
                         I'll go. I want to go.

               He picks up the puppy and an M16, then jumps over the side 
               onto the shore.

               EXT. SHORE - NIGHT

               As Willard and Lance walk across an open area, they are lit 
               by the battle in the background. Lance looks up and around 
               the embankment and along a barbed wire on the edge of the 
               road. SHELLS SCREAM overhead. Lance just stands looking down 
               on the phantasmagoric strings of lights, the smoke, the fires.

               Willard jumps down into a trench. We SEE a SOLDIER crouched, 
               holding his buddy, who is crying uncontrollably.

                                     WILLARD
                         Where can I find the C.O.?

                                     SOLDIER
                         You came right to it, son of a bitch!

                                     WILLARD
                         Lance! Get down here!

               Lance is still reacting to the pyrotechnics around him. He 
               turns and jumps down into the trench.

                                     WILLARD
                         You still got a commanding officer 
                         here?

                                     SOLDIER
                         Beverly Hills.

                                     WILLARD
                         What?

                                     SOLDIER
                         Right up the road there's a concrete 
                         bunker called Beverly Hills. Where 
                         the fuck else do you think it would 
                         be?

               Willard turns and moves away from the two soldiers. Lance 
               follows.

               The CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they proceed down the long trench. 
               They pass a group of black G.I.s. Suddenly Willard trips 
               over a body, and falls right into a mud puddle. The body 
               stirs.

                                     SOLDIER
                         You stepped in my face!

                                     LANCE
                         We thought you were dead.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Well, you thought wrong, damnit!

               They come to another gun emplacement, where two BACK SOLDIERS 
               are at a fifty-caliber machine gun. The GUNNERS blast away 
               into the night, walking and swearing at Vietcong. The SPOTTER 
               is feeding the bullets into the gun. Psychedelic guitar music 
               plays on a portable radio.

                                     GUNNER
                              (to enemy)
                         I told you to stop fucking with me! 
                         You think you're so bad, huh, nigga?

               Willard watches for a while, then shouts over to him.

                                     WILLARD
                         What are you shooting at, soldier?

                                     GUNNER
                         Gooks! What the fuck do you think 
                         I'm shooting at?
                              (turns and sees it's 
                              an officer)
                         I'm sorry, sir. There are gooks out 
                         there by the wire. But I think I 
                         killed them all.

                                     SPOTTER
                         You ain't shot shit! Listen!

               The enemy's yelling continues.

                                     GUNNER
                         Oh, shit, he's trying to call his 
                         friends. Send up a flare.

               The spotter reaches over and picks up a flare pistol, and 
               fires a FLARE into the air. The gunner starts blasting away 
               again,

                                     GUNNER
                         You think you so bad, nigga? You 
                         think you so bad?

               He stops firing. The yelling continues.

                                     SPOTTER
                         They're all dead, stupid. There's 
                         one still alive underneath them 
                         bodies.

                                     WILLARD
                         Who's the commanding officer here?

                                     GUNNER
                         Ain't you?
                              (to enemy)
                         You think you so bad? I got something 
                         for your ass! I got something for 
                         you now!

               Lance climbs up on top of the sandbags with the puppy and 
               looks at the pyrotechnics. Explosions go off all around him... 
               space city.

                                     SPOTTER
                         There's nothing but bodies, man!

                                     GUNNER
                              (to spotter)
                         Go get the Roach, man. Go get the 
                         Roach, nigga!

               The spotter moves down the trench, to where a tall lanky 
               black soldier wearing all sorts of beads and trinkets leans 
               against the ditch, sleeping.

                                     SPOTTER
                              (calling out)
                         Roach! Roach!

               THE ROACH gets up somewhat annoyed, but very cool, and 
               saunters up toward the machine gun. Willard looks over and 
               sees Lance up on top of the sandbags.

                                     WILLARD
                         Lance!

               Lance climbs down back into the trench. The Roach and spotter 
               move back to the machine gun, where the gunner waits. The 
               Roach turns off the radio, sits down, and listens.

                                     SPOTTER
                         Do you hear them? Well, bust them!

                                     VIETCONG (O.S.)
                         Hey, G.I., fuck you!

                                     GUNNER
                         You hear him out there on the wire, 
                         man?

                                     ROACH
                         Yeah.

                                     VIETCONG (O.S.)
                         Fuck you, you G.I.

                                     GUNNER
                         You need a flare?

                                     ROACH
                         No.
                              (listens)
                         He's close, man. He's real close.

                                     VIETCONG (O.S.)
                         G.I., fuck you!

               The Roach opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon, plunks 
               a big slug into it. He snaps it closed, then turns and wraps 
               the strap around his arm. He points the weapon up into the 
               air listens to the YELLING, calculating, then fires. The 
               grenade whistles off into the night. There is a sharp 
               EXPLOSION that cuts off the scream. Then the thud of bodies.

                                     ROACH
                         Motherfucker.

                                     WILLARD

                         command here?

                         Yeah.

               He turns and walks away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               FULL SHOT - PBR - BRIDGE - NIGHT

               The PBR stands in the shadows. Chef, the Chief, and Clean 
               are waiting for Willard and Lance. SHELLS WHISTLE BY and 
               CRASH in the distance as the welding continues on the bridge.

               Clean looks up and sees a direct hit on the bridge. TWO 
               SOLDIERS ate blown off some of the towers and into the water.

                                     CLEAN
                         Holy shit! Yo, Chief, two guys just 
                         got blown off that bridge,

                                     CHIEF
                         You hang on, man. You're gonna be 
                         okay.

               Clean turns and moves to the bow, where Chef is kneeling by 
               the mail bag.

                                     CLEAN
                         What's that?

                         Later on the mail! Watch them trees.

               Willard and Lance climb back onto the boat, loaded down with 
               supplies. They move down into the PBR.

                                     WILLARD
                         There's no diesel fuel, but I picked 
                         up some ammo. Let's move out.

                         Did you find the C.O., Captain?

                         You know which way, Chief.

               He takes off his shirt, then his T-shirt.

                                     CHEF
                         You're on your own, Captain. Still 
                         want to go on? Like this bridge. We 
                         build it every night, Charlie blows 
                         it right back up again, just so the 
                         generals can say the road's open.  
                         Think about it... who cares?

               FULL VIEW - THE PBR - NIGHT

               The men on the bridge continue to weld with their torches as 
               the PBR backs up, then the Chief pulls away from the bridge. 
               They all look back in the distance, the hills flash with 
               charges, there is a fiery glow, the concussion of heavy 
               explosions, as the BRIDGE BLOWS.

               river. Chef distributes mail from the mail bag.

                         watching TV.

               The colored smoke is getting in everybody's eyes. The whole 
               boat is enveloped.

               Clean's tape from his mom is PLAYING.

                         "...and that's much more that I can 
                         say for some of your friends. If 
                         this tape is any good, I will have 
                         Dad and the family send you a tape 
                         of their own.

               SUDDENLY streams of TRACERS whip out of the jungle at them, 
               other bullets smash and ricochet off the deck; glass shatters, 
               everybody jumps to their battle stations.

               Lance jumps into the turret of the twin fifties and starts 
               blasting away at the jungle. The Chief tries to power the 
               PBR out of the ambush. Clean jumps up behind the M60 machine 
               gun and starts firing. Willard uses his M16.

               Everything is confusion, yelling, gunfire, the thud of bullets 
               ripping into the PBR fiberglass hull. Lance's guns return 
               fire. He screams obscenities as he vents an almost superhuman 
               violence.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - LANCE - FIRING HIS GUNS

               Turning in the turret; bullets smash and explode around him.  
               Nobody quite knows where the fire is coming from.

               VIEW ON THE CHIEF

               The Chief steers and accelerates erratically, trying to dodge 
               the fire fight.

               VIEW ON CLEAN FIRING HIS GUN

               Firing the M60... suddenly it jams. As he rises up behind 
               the shield he is riddled by machine gun fire. The bullets 
               blast into his throat, chest, stomach... he falls to the 
               deck.

               Nobody has seen that he is down yet. They keep firing their 
               guns into the jungle. The Chief throttles forward, the boat 
               surges ahead and slams across the river. It is all over 
               quickly.

               The Chief turns and sees that Clean has been hit and is down 
               on the deck.

                                     CHIEF

                         Clean's hit! He's hit!

               Lance climbs out of the gun turret and looks around for the 
               little puppy.

               Chef crawls to Clean and turns him over. Sees that he is 
               dead.

               EXT. RIVER - PBR - DAY

               The boat under power, moving through fog. They pass downed 
               jets, wreckage, burning fires. Willard is sitting on the 
               bow, looking out into the distance as though he sees 
               something.

                                     WILLARD
                              (motions to Chief)
                         Hold on. Throw me the glasses.

               He looks through the binoculars.

               WILLARD'S P.O.V. - WRECKED FRENCH PLANTATION - DAY

               In the distance, we can make out a PLANTATION. The dock has 
               been devastated by years of fighting. There is a heavy FOG 
               or MIST everywhere. Up on the hill above the dock sits a 
               large house; it does not look heavily damaged.

               EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - DAY

               Willard picks up his M16 and moves to the front of the boat.  
               Chief has also seen the wrecked plantation.

                                     CHIEF
                         Lance. Get the 16 on the bow.

                         Chef, on the 60.

               The Chief pulls the PBR slowly up to the wrecked dock. Willard 
               jumps off with his M16 in hand and cautiously looks around.

               He walks into a wrecked barn. He comes out of the side and 
               makes his way back to Chef and Lance, who are standing on 
               the dock.

                                     CHIEF
                         Lance, cover the Captain.

               Suddenly from out of the fog... FRENCH VOICES shout out.

                                     LAFAVRE
                         You are surrounded. Return. Drop 
                         your weapons.

                              (in French)
                         Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
                              (to Lance and others)
                         They're French.
                              (n French, to soldiers)
                         I am dropping my weapon!

               Chef and Lance start to put down their M16s, the Chief shouts 
               out furiously from the boat.

                                     CHIEF
                         Chef! Pick up that weapon! Pick it 
                         up! Stand fast!

               Chef continues to shout to the French.

                                     CHEF
                         We are Americans! We are friends.

                                     LAFAVRE
                         Drop your weapons!

               As Willard walks down the dock, French soldiers appear out 
               of the fog, totally surrounding them. Willard stops in front 
               of them, realizing there is no way out, and raises his rifle 
               in surrender.

                                     CHIEF
                              (to Lance and Chef)
                         All right, you men. Put down your 
                         weapons.

               They all drop their weapons. More soldiers step out.

                                     CHEF
                              (in French)
                         We are Americans. We are friends. We 
                         are friends.

               We SEE more French and Cambodian soldiers as they step out 
               of the fog onto the dock. They move forward cautiously. It 
               is strange. It is like meeting up with a group of soldiers 
               from the French Indo-Chinese War. It's as though they've 
               stepped into 1954. The soldiers are still wearing parts of 
               the red berets of their particular unit that fought against 
               the Viet Minh. There are also Vietnamese who serve the French 
               and who fought with the French. They all bear older automatic 
               weapons and suspicion in their eyes.

               Another Frenchman joins the group. This is obviously the 
               patriarch of the family. HUBERT DEMARAIS is about fifty, 
               with a dignity and strength about him. He and Willard look 
               at each other.

                                     WILLARD
                         We lost one of our men.

                                     DEMARAIS
                         We French always pay respect to the 
                         dead of our allies. You're all 
                         welcome.
                              (pause)
                         My name is Hubert DeMarais. This is 
                         my family's plantation. It has been 
                         such for seventy years, and it will 
                         be such until we are all dead.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. GRAVEYARD - DOLLY SHOT - DAY

               The group is assembled. There is a platoon of Cambodian 
               soldiers standing by an open grave, SERGEANT LAFAVRE in front 
               of them.

                                     LAFAVRE
                         To my command! Attention! Weapons on 
                         the shoulder! Present weapons!

               The platoon present their weapons, as Clean's body is carried 
               toward the grave. The bugler brings the bugle up to his lips 
               and plays "Taps."

               Willard looks up and sees something on the balcony of the 
               house.

               HIS P.O.V:

               A young WOMAN, dressed in white, is on the balcony. She has 
               been watching the ceremony. She turns back into the house.

               The Chief bends down and picks up the tattered American flag, 
               which is on Clean's body. Lance places Clean's tape recorder 
               on the body. The body is lowered into the grave.

                                     CHIEF
                              (to Willard)
                         Captain, accept the flag of Tyrone 
                         Miller, on behalf of a grateful 
                         nation.

               He hands the folded flag to Willard.

               INT. DINING ROOM - GROUP - NIGHT

               We SEE the DeMarais interior. They have set up a table for 
               the crew, and with some of their own enlisted men. The table 
               is headed by Sergeant LaFavre, who is already seriously into 
               the wine.

               A waiter comes to the table and stops next to Chef. He is 
               holding a plate full of chicken, etc. Chef's face lights up 
               as he regards the wonderful European-style food.

                                     CHEF
                         This food is really wonderful, isn't 
                         it? The wine, the sauces. I can't 
                         believe it. Can I speak with the 
                         chef?

                                     LAFAVRE
                         The chef speaks only Vietnamese.

                                     CHEF
                         No kidding. He cooks like this and 
                         he can't even speak French?
                              (to Lance)
                         Hey, Lance, the chef's a slope.

               Lance has been loading up on food from the waiter's plate. 
               As the waiter moves away from him, Lance reaches across the 
               table for the bread and accidentally knocks over a glass.

                                     CHIEF
                         Hey, Lance...

               Lance realizes he is eating like an animal, sits back down.

               The VIEW MOVES ALONG THE TABLE AND REVEALS that on a higher 
               level there is a more elaborate table set, where the DeMarais 
               family is dining with Willard.

               Willard is sitting next to DeMarais, who is at the head of 
               the table. Christian, ANNE-MARIE, and old blind UNCLE, 
               Claudine, the TUTOR, and Philippe are all seated, listening 
               to one of the grandchildren, who is reciting a poem. The 
               other grandchildren stand nearby listening.

               The child stumbles through the poem.

                                     DEMARAIS
                              (in French)
                         You still need to study with Mr. 
                         Robert. Let's go. Not too bad. Go to 
                         bed everyone now.

               The children kiss their parents good night, and run out of 
               the room. DeMarais turns to Willard.

                                     DEMARAIS
                         This is Baudelaire. It is a very 
                         cruel poem for children, but they 
                         need it, because life sometime is 
                         very cruel.

               He reaches behind him and picks up a plaque, hands it to 
               Willard.

                                     DEMARAIS

                         Americans, six?

                                     DEMARAIS
                         Yes, well, there were perhaps 
                         mistakes.

               Willard hands the plaque back to DeMarais, who hands if off 
               to Philippe.

               ANOTHER ANGLE TO INCLUDE ROXANNE

               The young woman we saw earlier, ROXANNE, has come down the 
               stairs and moves into the dining Room. DeMarais looks up and 
               sees her.

                                     DEMARAIS
                              (in French)
                         Roxanne, you were curious to see 
                         these Americans, weren't you?

                                     ROXANNE
                              (in French)
                         No, I was only hungry.

               She stops in front of an empty chair next to Philippe.  
               Willard rises to greet her.

                                     DEMARAIS
                         May I present Captain Willard, he is 
                         of a Paratroop regiment. Madame 
                         Sarrault.

               She smiles and indicates for Willard to sit down.

                                     ROXANNE
                         Captain.

               She sits down. There is an uneasy silence. She laughs 
               slightly.

                                     ROXANNE
                              (in French)
                         "An angel passes..."

               DeMarais reacts.

                                     DEMARAIS
                              (in French)
                         "...Let's butcher it!" Do you remember 
                         this story in Paris, when the baron 
                         said, "Let's cut the angel?"

                                     ROXANNE
                              (in French)
                         I don't think that is the subject 
                         tonight.

                                     DEMARAIS
                         I'm sorry, Captain. It was just a 
                         little story. And people starving 
                         during the war. They are all around 
                         the table, and there was a silence, 
                         somebody say "An angel is passing 
                         by." So somebody say "Let's eat it!"
                              (laughs)

                                     WILLARD
                         How long can you possibly stay here?

                                     DEMARAIS
                         We stay forever.

                                     WILLARD
                         No, no, I mean, why don't you go 
                         back home to France?

                                     DEMARAIS
                         This is our home, Captain.

                         No!

               Roxanne interrupts, saying something to him in French. He 
               silences her.

                                     DEMARAIS
                              (to Willard)
                         You don't understand our mentality! 
                         The French officer mentality! At 
                         first, we lose in Second World War. 
                         I don't say that you Americans win, 
                         but we lose.

                                     CLAUDINE
                         Oh, Papa.

               DeMarais is starting to get heated up.

                                     DEMARAIS
                         When I speak, you shut up!
                              (to Willard)
                         In Dine Bien Phu, we lose! In Algeria, 
                         we lose! In Indochina, we lose. But 
                         here, we don't lose! This piece of 
                         earth, we keep it! We will never 
                         lose it! Never!

               The OLD BLIND UNCLE at the other end of the table speaks, as 
               Claudine cuts his food for him and feeds him.

                                     OLD UNCLE
                         And now you take French place, and 
                         the Viet Minh fight you. And what 
                         can you do? Nothing. Absolutely 
                         nothing.

                                     DEMARAIS
                         The Vietnamese are very intelligent. 
                         You never know what they think. The 
                         Russian ones who help them, "Come 
                         and give us their money, we are all 
                         Communists. Chinese, come and give 
                         us guns. We're all brothers." They 
                         hate the Chinese! Maybe they hate 
                         the American less that the Russian 
                         and the Chinese. If tomorrow the 
                         Vietnamese are Communists, they will 
                         be Vietnamese Communists. And this 
                         is something that you will never 
                         understand, you American.

                                     OLD UNCLE
                         I don't know. Maybe in the future we 
                         can make something with the Viet 
                         Minh.

                         Don't you understand? The V.C. say, 
                         "Go away! Go away!" That's finish 
                         for all the white people in Indochina. 
                         If you're French, American, that's 
                         all the same. "Go!" They want to 
                         forget you. Look, Captain --

               He rises from the table.

                                     DEMARAIS
                         Come on, Philippe. It's enough now.

               Philippe goes and picks up an egg from the basket, returns 
               to the table.

                                     PHILIPPE
                         Look, this is the truth...

               He breaks the egg in his hand, the contents dribble out.

                                     PHILIPPE
                         An egg, the white leaves, but the 
                         yellow stays!

               He turns and walks away.

                         They don't want to face the truth.

               He points to the dining room, turns and exits, LaFavre, 
               playing his accordion, walks toward the dining room.

                         When I was in Saigon, I spoke to an 
                         American politician, and he explained 
                         it very well. He said, "Look, 
                         Yesterday it was Korea, today Vietnam, 
                         tomorrow Thailand, the Philippines,

                         And even before the Second World 
                         War, the Americans knew exactly what 
                         was going on! They don't want that

                         the cannon up there in the mountain. 
                         But they do. Then they wait for the 
                         rain to come. When it comes, no 
                         airplane can fly there, and our

                         only do that to be dead with their

                              (to Willard)
                         You can win!

               He rises and goes to help the sergeant. As they leave, his 
               wife Anne-Marie sits there nervously, then rises, excusing 
               herself.

                                     OLD UNCLE
                         You know, I'm sure we can make 
                         something here. I'm sure about it, 
                         you know? I never do something wrong 
                         to the people here.

                                     TUTOR
                         That's right, but the Communists at 
                         home have never been traitors.

                                     DEMARAIS
                         No, never traitors.  For me, Mendes-
                         France was a Communist.

                                     TUTOR
                         Mendes-France was a Socialist.

                                     DEMARAIS
                         He was Communist! That's it!

               They get into an argument in French. The others look at each 
               other, at Willard, as the argument continues.

                                     TUTOR
                         Socialist.

                                     DEMARAIS
                         How do you want the government to 
                         win when it is Communist?

                                     TUTOR
                         Communists have always worked for 
                         peace wherever they are.

                                     DEMARAIS
                         They killed the French Army, which 
                         was the strongest. Destroyed because 
                         of who? The Communists.

                                     TUTOR
                         The army damaged itself by its 
                         attitude toward the people here.

                                     DEMARAIS
                         And why do you think that it did 
                         that? Because it understood it had 
                         been sacrificed by the Communist 
                         government.

                                     TUTOR
                         Socialist.

                                     DEMARAIS
                         Communist.

                                     TUTOR
                         Captain, good night.

               The tutor gets up and starts to walk out... gives Demarais 
               one more shot.

                                     TUTOR
                              (to DeMarais)
                         Mendes-France was a Socialist.

               He leaves.

                                     OLD UNCLE
                         We can stay. I know we can stay. You 
                         know, we always helped the people, 
                         we work with the people.

               The old man continues babbling, as Claudine helps him up.

                                     CLAUDINE
                         Come on, we are leaving.

                                     OLD UNCLE
                         So we can be friends, we are agreed.

               The exit, Claudine consoling him. Now only Roxanne, Willard, 
               and DeMarais are at the table.

                                     DEMARAIS
                         See, Captain, when my grandfather 
                         and my uncle's father came here, 
                         there was nothing. Nothing. The 
                         Vietnamese were nothing. So we worked 
                         hard, very hard, and brought the 
                         rubber from Brazil, and then plant 
                         it here. We took the Vietnamese, 
                         work with them, make something, 
                         something out of nothing. So when 
                         you ask me why we want to stay here, 
                         Captain, we want to stay here because 
                         it's ours, it belongs to us. It keeps 
                         out family together. We fight for 
                         that! While you Americans, you are 
                         fighting for the biggest nothing in 
                         history. I'm sorry Captain. I will 
                         see if your men needs any help to 
                         repair your boat, so that you can go 
                         on with your war. Good night, Roxanne.

               He rises from the table and moves out of the room. Willard 
               and Roxanne are left alone at the table.

                                     ROXANNE
                         I apologize for my family, Captain. 
                         We have all lost much here. Hubert-
                         his wife and two sons. And I have 
                         lost a husband.

                                     WILLARD
                         I understand.

                                     ROXANNE
                         You are tired of the war. I can see 
                         it in your face. It was the same in 
                         the eyes of the soldiers of our war. 
                         We called them "Les Soldat Perdus." 
                         The Lost Soldiers
                              (a beat)
                         If you like we can have some cognac.

               She rises and moves to the living room.

                                     WILLARD
                         No, I have to see about my men and...

               Roxanne stops at the bottom of the stairs. She turns to look 
               at him. 

                                     ROXANNE
                         The war will still be here tomorrow.

                                     WILLARD
                         Yeah, I guess you're right.

               He rises and walks down into the living room. Roxanne moves 
               toward a table full of liquor bottles.

                                     ROXANNE
                         I noticed you had no wine at dinner.

               She begins to pour cognac into a glass.

                                     WILLARD
                         No, I don't drink wine. I do like 
                         cognac, but I don't want any now, 
                         thank you.

                                     ROXANNE
                         Well, then I must drink alone then.

               She picks up her glass of cognac, and walks by Willard out 
               onto the terrace. Stops and looks back at him.

                                     ROXANNE
                         Will you go back after the war to 
                         America?

                                     WILLARD
                         No.

                                     ROXANNE
                         Then you're like us, your home is 
                         here.

               She walks farther out onto the terrace, sits down on a sofa, 
               with her back to the river below. Willard follows her and 
               stands next to her at the railing. We can SEE men working on 
               the PBR down below at the dock.

                                     ROXANNE
                         Do you know why you can never step 
                         into the same river twice?

                                     WILLARD
                         Yeah. Because it's always moving.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ROXANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Our VIEW starts CLOSE ON Roxanne's hands. She is holding a 
               long opium pipe. In the other hand she holds a long tamper 
               with some opium on the end. She handles it expertly over a 
               small lamp with open flame, heating it, then putting the 
               bead of opium into the pipe.

                                     ROXANNE
                         I used to prepare a pipe for my 
                         husband. It was morphine he took for 
                         the wounds he suffered in his heart.

               She looks over at Willard. They are both lying on her bed, 
               next to each other.

                                     ROXANNE
                         He would rage and he would cry, my 
                         lost soldier. And I said to him, 
                         "There are two of you, don't you 
                         see? One that kills and one that 
                         loves." And he said to me, "I don't 
                         know whether I am animal or a god." 
                         But you are both.

               She offers him the pipe, he takes it and inhales the smoke 
               from the opium, gives it back to her. She smokes also.

                                     ROXANNE
                         You want more?

               He shakes his head.

                                     ROXANNE
                         All that matters is that you are 
                         alive. You are alive, Captain. That's 
                         the truth.

               She gets up from the bed, unties one of the strings of the 
               bed canopy, and takes off her robe, revealing her naked body. 
               She walks around the bed, untying the other strings. She 
               approaches him. He reaches up to her.

                                     ROXANNE
                         There are two of you, don't you see? 
                         One that kills... and one that loves.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RIVER - PBR - DAY

               Mist swells up around the river as the boat moves into an 
               obscure FOG. Willard is up front on the bow, trying to see 
               what's ahead. The Chief is at the helm.

               ED. CLOSE SHOT - THE CHIEF

               We catch a glimpse of him, even though we are in the fog, he 
               can't see a thing. Finally he shuts down the engine and they 
               coast.

                                     CHIEF
                         Can't see nothing. We're stopping.

               Willard jumps up and moves to the Chief.

                                     WILLARD
                         You're not authorized to stop this 
                         boat, Chief.

                                     CHIEF
                         I said I can't see a thing, Captain! 
                         I'm stopping this boat! I ain't 
                         risking no more lives!

                                     WILLARD
                         I'm in command here, goddamnit. You'll 
                         do what I say!

                                     CHIEF
                              (to Chef)
                         You see anything, Chef?

               Chef is at the back of the boat behind the M50. He searches 
               the banks.

                                     CHEF
                         Why don't they fucking attack, man?

               ANGLE ON  LANCE

               His head back, wailing eerily.

                                     CHEF
                         Watch it over there, Chief. Got a 
                         stump.

                                     CHIEF
                         Lance, on the fifties.

               ANGLE ON THE PBR

               We catch glimpses through the moving FOG, all of the men on 
               the PBR, at their guns, searching the shoreline.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         He was close. He was real close. I 
                         couldn't see him yet, but I could 
                         feel him, as if the boat were being 
                         sucked up river and the water was 
                         flowing back into the jungle. Whatever 
                         was going to happen, it wasn't going 
                         to be the way they called it back in 
                         Nah Trang.

               SUDDENLY the air is filled with arrows, an avalanche of arrows 
               in the sky. They come down clattering on the deck. Chef opens 
               fire.

                                     WILLARD
                         Arrows!

                                     CHIEF
                         Fire! Chef, open fire! Fire! Lance! 
                         Fire!

               ANOTHER ANGLE - ARROWS

               Arrows everywhere, primitive spears flung expertly.

               ANGEL ON LANCE

               In the front turret, arrows whiz around him. He turns, smiles, 
               picks one up, looks at it, breaks it in half.

               ANGLE ON THE CHEF

               Frightened, but almost heroic, firing his weapon and shouting 
               obscenities at the weird, dancing heathens attacking him. 
               Arrows fall harmlessly around him.

               HIGH ANGLE - THE SKY

               Thousands of arrows in the sky come clattering down on the 
               deck by the Chief.

               ANGLE TO GO WITH WILLARD

               Amazed... immediately he knows they're harmless, done more 
               to frighten than to injure. But still, he's never seen 
               anything like this in all his time in Vietnam, and he knows 
               in his gut that it is still another message from Kurtz. He 
               moves to Chef, tries to make him stop firing.

                                     WILLARD
                         Chef! Chef, it's okay! Quit firing! 
                         They're just little arrows. Cut it 
                         out! Quiet! Chief, tell them to hold 
                         their fire! They're just little 
                         sticks! They're trying to scare us!

               The Chief picks up his M16 and turns to Willard wildly.

                                     CHIEF
                         You got us in this mess, and now you 
                         can't get us out, because you don't 
                         know where the hell you're going, do 
                         you?
                              (no answer)
                         Do you? You son of a bitch! You 
                         bastard!

               The Chief leaves the wheel of the PBR and steps up on the 
               deck with his M16.

                                     WILLARD
                              (to Lance)
                         Lance, get the wheel!

               Lance moves to take over the wheel, as Chief starts firing 
               his M16 madly.

                                     CHIEF
                         You savages! Come and get it, you 
                         son of a bitches!

               He drops the M16, moves to the M60 machine gun and starts 
               firing madly again.

               Suddenly the Chief stops short, puzzled, a small droplet of 
               blood lines his mouth. He coughs up a mouthful of blood, 
               then looks down. The head of a SPEAR has gone through his 
               chest. He looks up at Willard.

                                     CHIEF
                         A spear?

               He remains looking directly into Willard's eyes, then starts 
               to fall. Willard catches him, and is pulled down to the deck 
               by the weight of the Chief's body. The Chief looks up at him 
               and suddenly reaches his hands for Willard's throat, trying 
               to pull Willard down on top of the spearhead, trying to skewer 
               him, and pull him along with him to death. A beat as they 
               struggle, then suddenly the Chief DIES.

               EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - DAY

               Lance is putting camouflage paint on the Chief.

               Willard has jumped off the boat with all of his gear. Chef 
               looks down at him.

                                     WILLARD
                         My mission is to make it up to 
                         Cambodia. There's a Green Beret 
                         colonel up there who's gone insane, 
                         and I'm supposed to kill him.

                                     CHEF
                         That's fucking typical! Shit! Fucking 
                         Vietnam mission! I'm short and we 
                         gotta go up there so you can kill 
                         one of our own guys? That's fucking 
                         great! That's just fucking great, 
                         man! Shit! That's fucking crazy! I 
                         thought you were going to blow up a 
                         bridge, or some fucking railroad 
                         tracks, or something!

               Lance has pulled the Chief's body into the river, and jumped 
               in himself. Willard and Chef watches him, as he tries to 
               bury Chief's body in the water.

               Willard turns to leave.

                                     WILLARD
                         That's all right.

                                     CHEF
                         No, wait. We'll go together. On the 
                         boat. We'll go with you. We'll go 
                         out there. But on the boat, okay?

               Lance gently floats Chief off downstream. We SEE the Chief's 
               body slowly disappear.

               EXT. RIVER - PBR - NIGHT

               The PBR moves up-river. The shore is lit up with burning 
               torches and a large wooden structure in flames. We SEE the 
               faces of the remaining crew, as they take in this sight.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RIVER - THE PBR - DAY

               The boat passes rows of skulls, flaming torches, men impaled 
               on poles, etc.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Part of me was afraid of what I would 
                         find, and what I would do when I got 
                         there. I knew the risks. Or imagined 
                         I knew. But the thing I felt the 
                         most, much stringer than fear, was 
                         the desire to confront him.

               Lance is at the back of the boat, moving in a slow-motion 
               Tai Chi.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RIVER - PBR - DAY

               The PBR is slowly moving TOWARD CAMERA. Lance and Willard 
               are standing on the bow of the boat. Chef is at the helm. 
               The men stare forward in amazement. Willard has the binoculars 
               around his neck. He brings them up to his eyes and looks.

                                     WILLARD
                              (to Chef)
                         Just keep moving.
                              (to Lance)
                         Lance, keep your hands away from the 
                         guns.

               OUR VIEW MOVES slowly behind them and we SEE that they see.

               Hundreds of Montagnard natives, body and faces painted white, 
               of the most savage nature, but there is a purity about them.  
               Men and boys stand passively on canoes side by side, blocking 
               the river.

               There are also hundreds of other NATIVES lining the shore on 
               both sides, dressed in most ornate and primitive manner, in 
               feathers, parts of birds and animals. Fires and dead bodies 
               are everywhere.

               OUR VIEW MOVES

               Behind the PBR, closer and closer to this fantastic human 
               wall blocking them. The natives accept the PBR, allowing it 
               to pass into them with a sort of inevitability.

               VIEW ON WILLARD, LANCE AND CHEF

               Reacting as they pass through the natives on canoes, then 
               look up toward the bask.

               WHAT THEY SEE:

               The temple. A magnificent fortified encampment built around 
               the ruins of a former Cambodian civilization.

               NEW ANGLE - FULL VIEW BEHIND THE PBR AS IT PROCEEDS

               The scale of this thing is enormous. Great enigmatic Cambodian 
               faces carved out of stone from thousands of years ago. The 
               fortress reaches out across the river where part of its ruins 
               still stand on the opposite side nod on a small island. It's 
               as though the river flowed into the great rams of the sphinx-
               like temple. Aligning the fortifications are concertina wire, 
               automatic weapons emplacements. There is even wreckage of 
               Hueys as armed machine gun nests. It is a strange combination 
               of the very modern and the very primitive. In this 
               installation, WE SEE LIVING families, fires, nomadic 
               dwellings, several HUNDRED of the most primitive MOTAGNARDS 
               that ever existed. Some carry spears, occasionally other 
               emerge from the jungle, scurrying around with the activity 
               that the arrival of a stranger brings. The air is heavy with 
               the weight of hundreds of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. A think greasy 
               smoke hangs from fires that burn and around the fort. Fresh 
               shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near the dock, and 
               everywhere else, there are tangled piles of corpses, half-
               submerged in the water, piles of bodies of the dead.

               As the PBR moves up, a HEAD suddenly is thrust into VIEW. 
               The heads is that of a particularly wild, long-haired, stubble-
               faced MAN. He has three or four camera bodies around his 
               neck; a large bag stuffed with lenses and film. He is dressed 
               in rags and tatters. He shouts out.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         It's all right! It's all right! It's 
                         been approved!

               The PBR moves slowly toward the steps, as the man continues 
               to shout out.

                                     CHEF
                         I ain't coming in there! Them bastards 
                         attacked us!

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Zap 'em with your siren, man. Zap 
                         'em with your siren.

               Chef BLOWS THE SIREN on the PBR. The Natives react, never 
               having heard one before; they scatter in all directions, 
               running away scared.

               The photographer moves down onto the landing, directing the 
               boat.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         There's mines over there! Mines over 
                         there, too! And watch out, those 
                         goddamn monkeys bit you, I tell you.

               The PBR crew are exhausted, staring at him through their mud-
               and-blood splattered faces.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Move it in right toward me.

               He jumps onboard the boat and immediately advances towards 
               Lance. He shakes his hand, moves to the others, and shakes 
               their hands as well.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         I'm an American. An American civilian. 
                         Hi, Yanks. Hi. American. American 
                         civilian. It's all right.
                              (to Chef)
                         And you got the cigarettes, and what's 
                         what I've been dreaming of.

               Chef flips him a packet of cigarettes.

                                     WILLARD
                              (or photographer)
                         Who are you?

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Who are you? I'm a photojournalist.  
                         I've covered the war since '64. I've 
                         been in Loas, Cambodia, 'Nam...
                              (looking around the 
                              boat)
                         I'll tell you one thing. This boat 
                         is a mess, man.

                                     WILLARD
                              (gestures to natives)
                         Who are all these people?

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         They think you've come to take him 
                         away. I hope that isn't true.

                                     WILLARD
                         Take who away?

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                              (gestures to temple)
                         Him! Colonel Kurtz! These are all 
                         his children, man, as far as you can 
                         see. Hell, man, out here, we are all 
                         his children.

                                     WILLARD
                         Could we talk to Colonel Kurtz?

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Hey, man, you don't talk to the 
                         Colonel. Well, you listen to him.

               Willard steps off the boat onto the steps. He turns and looks 
               back at the Photographer.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         The man's enlarged my mind. He's a 
                         poet-warrior in a classic sense. I 
                         mean, sometimes he'll -- well, you 
                         say hello to him, right? And he'll 
                         just walk right by you and he won't 
                         even notice you. And then suddenly 
                         he'll grab you and he'll throw you 
                         in a corner and he'll say "Do you 
                         know that the 'if' is the middle 
                         word in 'life'? If you can keep your 
                         head when all about you are losing 
                         theirs and blaming it on you. If you 
                         can trust yourself when all men doubt 
                         you." I'm a little man, I'm a little 
                         man. He's a great man.
                              (a beat)
                         "I should have been a pair of ragged 
                         claws scuttling across floors of 
                         silent seas."

               Willard, incredulous, turns away to Lance.

                                     WILLARD
                         Stay with the boat.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Don't go without me, okay. I want to 
                         get a picture.

               Willard and Chef start up the steps. The Photographer walks 
               with them, taking photographs.

               They reach the top of the steps. Gradually the natives and 
               savages show themselves -- fierce and frightening, jungle 
               fighters, mostly Montagnard. They wear only loincloths and 
               bandoleers of ammunition. Their bodies are painted in strange 
               patterns. Death and parts of bodies are everywhere.

                         He can be terrible, and he can be 
                         mean, and he can be right. He's 
                         fighting the war. He's a great man. 
                         I mean, I wish I had words you know? 
                         I wish I had words. I could tell you 
                         something like, the other day he 
                         wanted to kill me.

                                     WILLARD
                         Why did he want to kill you?

               They come to a stop.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Because I took his picture. He said, 
                         "If you take my picture again, I'm 
                         going to kill you." And he meant it. 
                         See, just lay cool, lay cool. Lay 
                         back, dig it.

               They start walking forward again, as the photographer 
               continues.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         He gets friendly again, he really 
                         does. But you don't judge the colonel. 
                         You don't judge the colonel like 
                         ordinary men.

               ANGLE ON  WILLARD

               looking carefully as he moves forward

               MOVING POV

               More natives and savages. Interspersed among them are a few 
               taller men with paler skins, with the remnants of army 
               insignia on them.

               ANGLE ON  WILLARD

               reacting, as he moves forward. Chef is frightened, as he 
               follows Willard.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               They move closer and closer to the temple. The photographer 
               runs up ahead of Willard and stops in front of the man with 
               paler skins... these are remnants of the Green Beret "A" 
               Team.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Okay, watch it now! These are 
                         Americans! Americans!
                              (to Willard)
                         You can feel the vibe of this place. 
                         Let me take a picture. Hey, could 
                         you hold it? Hello? Could you hold 
                         it for a minute?

               The photographer starts clicking away with a Nikon, as Willard 
               moves toward what once must have been an American. He wears 
               only a shotgun cartridge and striker pants. His face is 
               darkened from dirt, battle smoke, matted mud and grease.

               Willard stops and looks at him.

                                     WILLARD
                         Colby?

               Colby is silent. Then he and the other Berets, woman, 
               children, etc., slowly part, making way for Willard. Willard 
               slowly moves through the group and looks.

               WHAT HE SEES

               The stone steps of the temple. Resting on the steps are 
               freshly screed heads, blood washing down from them. They sit 
               decorating the entrance to the temple like so many gruesome 
               pumpkins.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         The heads. You're looking at the 
                         heads. Sometimes he goes too far, 
                         and he's the first one to admit it.

               Chef, behind Willard, looks at the heads.

                                     CHEF
                         He's gone crazy.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Wrong! Wrong! If you could have heard 
                         the man just two days ago, if you 
                         could've heard him then. God. You 
                         were gonna call him crazy?

                                     CHEF
                         Fucking A.

                                     WILLARD
                         I just want to talk to him.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Well, man, he's gone away. He 
                         disappeared out in the jungle with 
                         his people.

               He continues forward. The others follow.

                                     WILLARD
                         I'll wait for him.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         He feels comfortable with his people. 
                         He forgets himself with his people. 
                         He forgets himself.

                                     CHEF
                         Captain, maybe we should wait back 
                         at the boat.

                                     WILLARD
                              (turns back to him)
                         Okay, Chef, we'll go back to the 
                         boat for a while.

                                     CHEF
                         Yeah. Stay with Lance.

               EXT. KURTZ COMPOUND - DUSK

               A stone head with palm leaves hanging over it.

               EXT. PBR - DUSK

               Lance is squatting at the bow of the boat holding a spear, 
               sticking it into the water, probably trying to spear a fish.

               A GROUP OF NATIVES are gathered by the steps of the dock. 
               One of the natives climbs the tree next to the dock and cuts 
               loose a dead body. It falls into the river with a splash.

               Chef sits next to Willard in the cabin.

                                     CHEF
                         This colonel guy, he's wacko, man. 
                         He's worse than crazy, he's evil! 
                         That's what the man's got set up 
                         here, man! It's fucking pagan 
                         idolatry! Look around you! Shit, 
                         he's loco.

               Willard is putting on his tiger shirt.

                                     WILLARD
                         Then you'll help me?

                                     CHEF
                         Fucking A, I'll help you. I'll do 
                         anything to get out of this joint! 
                         We could blow all them assholes away!

               CAMERA PANS the savages onshore, who have gathered around 
               them, watching them. We SEE a sign written in a wild hand 
               with white spray paint on a wall: "OUR MOTTO: APOCALYPSE 
               NOW!"

                                     CHEF
                         They're so fucking spaced out, they 
                         wouldn't even know it. I ain't afraid 
                         of all them fucking skulls and altars 
                         and shit! I used to think that if I 
                         died in an evil place, then my soul 
                         wouldn't make it to heaven. But now... 
                         fuck. I don't care where it goes, as 
                         long as it ain't here. So what do 
                         you want to do? I'll kill the fuck.

                                     WILLARD
                              (picks up the map)
                         No, no. I'm gonna need you to wait 
                         here, Chef. I'll go up with Lance 
                         and scrounge around, check the place 
                         out, see if I can find the colonel, 
                         okay?

                                     CHEF
                         But what do you want me to do? Damnit.

               Willard picks up a field radio and hands it to Chef, Chef 
               looks at it.

                                     WILLARD
                         Here, you take the radio, and if I 
                         don't get back by 22:00 hours, you 
                         call in the air strike.

               Chef stares at him.

                                     CHEF
                         Air strike?

                                     WILLARD
                         The code is "Almighty," coordinates 
                         zero-nine-two-six-four-seven-one-
                         two. It's all in there.

               He hands the map to Chef.

               EXT. KURTZ COMPOUND - DAY

               Willard and Lance walk through the temple grounds in the 
               rain.  Willard is gradually surrounded by more and more native 
               soldiers.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         Everything I saw told me that Kurtz 
                         had gone insane. The place was full 
                         of bodies. North Vietnamese, Vietcong, 
                         Cambodians... If I was still alive, 
                         it was because he wanted me that 
                         way.

               The soldiers close in on him, pick him up, and turn him upside 
               down, rolling him in the mud.

               LOW ANGLE ON LANCE

               He is slowly walking among passing natives. He is oblivious 
               to what is happening to Willard.

               MED.  SHOT - WILLARD

               Being turned in mud by the natives.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               Willard, hands tied behind his back, is guided down a long 
               corridor, followed by two Montagnards, both armed.

                                     WILLARD (V.O.)
                         It smelled like slow death in there. 
                         Malaria and nightmares. This was the 
                         end of the river, all right.

               They turn into the main room. The natives indicate for Willard 
               to kneel down on the floor. The CAMERA MOVES, REVEALING KURTZ 
               lying in shadow on a bed. We will SEE him only in darkness 
               and shadow throughout the scene.

                                     KURTZ
                         Where you from, Willard?

                                     WILLARD
                         I'm from Ohio, sir.

                                     KURTZ
                         Were you born there?

                                     WILLARD
                         Yes, sir.

                                     KURTZ
                         Whereabouts?

                                     WILLARD
                         Toledo, sir.

                                     KURTZ
                         How far are you from the river?

                                     WILLARD
                         The Ohio River, sir?  About two 
                         hundred miles.

                                     KURTZ
                         I went down that river once when I 
                         was a kid. There's a place in the 
                         river, I can't remember... must have 
                         been a gardenia plantation, or a 
                         flower plantation at one time. It's 
                         all wild and overgrown now. But for 
                         about five miles, you'd think that 
                         heaven just fell on the earth, in 
                         the form of gardenias.

               Kurtz reaches down and picks up a bowl full of water. He 
               splashes water on his face and head.

                                     KURTZ
                         Have you ever considered, any real 
                         freedoms? Freedoms from the opinions 
                         of others. Even the opinions of 
                         yourself. Did they say why, Willard? 
                         Why they wanted to terminate my 
                         command?

                                     WILLARD
                         I was sent on a classified mission, 
                         sir.

                                     KURTZ
                         Its no longer classified, is it. 
                         What did they tell you?

                                     WILLARD
                         They told me, that you had gone... 
                         totally insane. And that your methods 
                         were unsound.

                                     KURTZ
                         Are my methods unsound?

                                     WILLARD
                         I don't see any method at all, sir.

                                     KURTZ
                         I expected someone like you. What 
                         did you expect? Are you an assassin?

                         I'm a soldier.

               We finally SEE KURTZ'S FACE.

                                     KURTZ
                         You're neither. You're an errand 
                         boy, sent by grocery clerks, to 
                         collect a bill.

               EXT. KURTZ COMPOUND - TRAIL UP FROM RIVER - DAY

               The photographer hurries down the trail past villagers and 
               soldiers toward the compound, and up the hill that leads 
               toward the TIGER CAGES in front of the Monkey Temple. He 
               spots a jug full of water, with a ladle in it.

               AT TIGER CAGES - TO GO WITH PHOTOGRAPHER

               The photographer moves to Willard who is in a tiger cage. 
               Willard is in pretty bad shape, weak and thirsty. The 
               photographer stops in front of him. He holds the ladle for 
               Willard to drink from.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Why? Why would a nice guy like you 
                         want to kill a genius? Feeling pretty 
                         good, huh? Why? Do you know that the 
                         man really likes you?

               He puts a cigarette in Willard's mouth.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         He likes you. He really likes you. 
                         But he's got something in mind for 
                         you. Aren't you curious about that? 
                         I'm curious. I'm very curious. Are 
                         you curious?

               The photographer walks around Willard's cage.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         There's something happening out here, 
                         man. You know something, man? I know 
                         something you that you don't know. 
                         That's right, Jack. The man is clear 
                         in his mind, but his soul is mad. 
                         Oh, yeah. He's dying, I think. He 
                         hates all this. He hates it! But the 
                         man's a... He reads poetry out loud, 
                         all right? And a voice... he likes 
                         you 'cause you're still alive. He's 
                         got plans for you. No, I'm not gonna 
                         help you. You're gonna help him, 
                         man. You're gonna help him. I mean, 
                         what are they gonna sat when he's 
                         gone? 'Cause he dies when it dies, 
                         when it dies, he dies! What are they 
                         gonna say about him? He was a kind 
                         man? He was a wise man? He has plans? 
                         He has wisdom? Bullshit, man! Am I 
                         gonna be the one that's gonna set 
                         them straight? Look at me! Wrong!
                              (points to Willard)
                         You!

               Chef is sleeping on-deck in the rain, under a tarp.

                         boat. Fuck. Has it been eight hours?

               He lifts the tap off, gets up, and goes to the cabin.

               covered with mud, tied up and wet from rain. He slowly looks 
               up.

               KURTZ IS STANDING OVER HIM. He is dressed in the black pajamas 
               of the Vietcong. His face is made up in green-and-black 
               camouflage paint. He disappears behind Willard, then reappears 
               and drops something into Willard's lap. Willard looks down 
               and sees CHEF'S SEVERED HEAD in his lap.

               Willard screams and struggles to jostle it out of his lap. 
               It finally falls out.

               INT. CONEX CONTAINER - DAY

               Willard is passed out, lying on the floor of a metal CONEX 
               CONTAINER. It is hot. Some CHILDREN are peeking in at him.

               The two front doors of the container are opened. Light floods 
               in. Kurtz is standing there with the children. He holds a 
               bunch of magazine articles.

               He sits down on a dirt step, surrounded by children.

               He looks down at a magazine article and begins to read it to 
               Willard.

                                     KURTZ
                              (reading)

                         the Horizon. The American people may 
                         find it hard to believe that the 
                         U.S. is winning the war in Vietnam. 
                         Nevertheless, one of the most 
                         exhaustive inquiries into the status 
                         of the conflict yet compiled, offers 
                         considerable evidence that the weight 
                         of U.S. power, two and a half years 
                         after the big buildup began, is 
                         beginning to make itself felt. White 
                         House officials maintain the impact 
                         of that strength may bring the enemy 
                         to the point where he could simply 
                         be unable to continue fighting."
                              (to Willard)
                         Is this familiar?

               Willard reacts.

                         sufficiently impressed with the

                         returned to Vietnam to sound out the 
                         situation for President Nixon. He 
                         told the president last week that 
                         things felt much better, and smelled 
                         much better over there."

               He looks over at Willard.

                                     KURTZ
                              (to Willard)
                         How do they smell to you, soldier?

               Willard doesn't answer. Kurtz rises. The children are laughing 
               and giggling. Kurtz drops the magazine articles in Willard's 
               lap.

                                     KURTZ

                         be shot. We can talk of these things 
                         later.

               Kurtz turns and exits, closing one of the doors, leaving the 
               other open. Willard watches him go. The children stay, looking 
               at him, laughing and giggling. Willard slowly and painfully 
               pulls himself to his feet. He stands there a moment looking 
               at the children, then collapses to the floor.

               seated on a small chest next to his bed. He is reading from 
               a small book. It is "The Hollow Man" by T.S. Eliot.

                         dialectics. It's one through nine,

                         hate them.

               Photographer rises and exits down the corridor leaving Willard 
               alone. Kurtz looks at him.

               Willard is at a table containing Kurtz's belongings. He looks

                         was in there with him for days. Not 
                         under guard. I was free. But he knew 
                         I wasn't going anywhere. He knew 
                         more about what I was going to do at 
                         I did. If the generals back in Nah 
                         Trang could see what I saw, would 
                         they still want me to kill him? More 
                         than ever, probably. And what would 
                         his people back home want, if they 
                         ever learned just how far from them 
                         he'd really gone. He broke from them, 
                         and then he broke from himself. I'd 
                         never seen a man so broken up and 
                         ripped apart.

               ANGLE ON DOORWAY

               Kurtz enters in the darkness.

                                     KURTZ
                         I've seem horrors. Horrors that you've 
                         seen. But you have no right to call 
                         me a murderer. You have a right to 
                         kill me. You have a right to do that. 
                         But you have no right to judge me.

                         It's impossible for words to describe 
                         what is necessary to those who do 
                         not know what horror means. Horror. 
                         Horror has a face. And you must make 
                         a friend of horror. Horror and moral 
                         terror are your friends. If they are 
                         not, then they are enemies to be 
                         feared. They are truly enemies.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Colby is standing in the rear doorway of the main temple, 
               going through a Tai Chi routine. Willard sits in front of 
               him, looking at Kurtz, listening to him as he talks from the 
               bed. A native WOMAN is there, listening as well.

                                     KURTZ
                         I remember when I was with Special 
                         Forces. Seems a thousand centuries 
                         ago. We went into a camp to inoculate 
                         some children. We'd left the camp 
                         after we had inoculated the children 
                         for polio. And this old man came 
                         running after us, and he was crying. 
                         He couldn't say. We went back there, 
                         and they had come and hacked off 
                         every inoculated arm. They they were, 
                         in a pile. A pile of little arms. 
                         And, I remember, I cried, I wept 
                         like some grandmother. I wanted to 
                         tear my teeth out. I didn't know 
                         what I wanted to do. And I want to 
                         remember it. I never want to forget 
                         it. I never want to forget it. And 
                         then I realized, like I was shot, 
                         like I was shot with a diamond bullet 
                         through my forehead. And I thought, 
                         My God, the genius of that! The 
                         genius. The will to do that. Perfect, 
                         genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. 
                         And then I realized, they were 
                         stronger than we. Because they could 
                         stand it. These were not monsters. 
                         These were men, strained cadres. 
                         These men who fought with their 
                         hearts, who have families, who have 
                         children, who are filled with love... 
                         that they had the strength, the 
                         strength to do that. If I had ten 
                         divisions of those men, then our 
                         troubles here would be over very 
                         quickly. You have to have men who 
                         are moral, and at the same time, who 
                         are able to utilize their primordial 
                         instincts to kill without feeling, 
                         without passion. Without judgment. 
                         Without Judgment. Because it's 
                         judgment that defeats us.

               Standing in the doorway of the temple. We SEE a WATER BUFFALO 
               in the foreground, walking down the steps.

               EXT. TEMPLE - CEREMONIAL GROUNDS - NIGHT

               NATIVES are conducting a ceremony. They are dancing and 
               singing around the WATER BUFFALO. A priest is chanting.

                                     KURTZ (V.O.)
                         Everything I did. Everything you 
                         saw. Because there's nothing I detest 
                         more than the stench of lies. And if 
                         you understand me, Willard, you will 
                         do this for me.

               Lance is sitting with the natives, painted and dressed like 
               one of them. A line of natives with spears dance toward the 
               water buffalo. Others are sitting and singing in the 
               background.

               It has been deserted except for monkeys crawling on it.

                         They were gonna make me a major for 
                         this, and I wasn't even in their 
                         fucking army anymore. Everybody wanted 
                         me to do it. Him most of all. I felt 
                         like he was up there, waiting for me 
                         to take his pain away. He just wanted 
                         to go out like a soldier.

               He gets up and emerges out of darkness.

               MIST OVER WATER

               A small bubble rises to the surface, then another. Suddenly 
               but quietly, water and mud pour off revealing Willard, 
               emerging slowly, head first, as if he was growing out of the 
               water.

               Sits crouched holding a machete as natives dance in the 
               background. He rises slowly and then runs off.

               INT. INSIDE THE TEMPLE - NIGHT

               Willard works his way toward the interior of the temple. He 
               appears behind a guard, pouts his hand over the warriors 
               mouth, brings up the machete, and pulls him back into the 
               dark shadows.

               INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING ACTION WITH WATER BUFFALO CEREMONY

               Kurtz is sitting and talking into a tape recorder. Willard 
               slowly moves forward, quietly sneaking toward Kurtz as he 
               speaks.

                         airplanes because it's obscene.

               Willard steps behind Kurtz, raising the machete. Kurtz turns. 
               Willard brings the knife down and starts hacking away at 
               Kurtz, hitting him first on the shoulder, then all over.

               the Bomb, Exterminate them all."

               EXT. FRONT OF TEMPLE - NIGHT

               The natives are all gathered in front of the temple, looking 
               at Willard as he moves forward holding the machete and Kurtz's 
               books. The entire village is there, about a THOUSAND NATIVES 
               in all. They realize that Willard is now their leader and 
               pay homage to him by kneeling or sitting down.

               Willard slowly walks down the steps, throwing down the 
               machete. The natives rise and throw down their weapons in 
               imitation as he walks through them. He moves to LANCE, who 
               is in the midst of all the natives. Willard looks at him, 
               then takes him by the hand and pulls him away with him through 
               the rest of the natives.
