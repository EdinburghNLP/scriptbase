     EXT. WALL STREET - EARLY MORNING

     FADE IN. THE STREET. The most famous third of a mile in the
     world. Towering landmark structures nearly blot out the
     dreary grey flannel sky. The morning rush hour crowds swarm
     through the dark, narrow streets like mice in a maze, all in
     pursuit of one thing: MONEY... CREDITS RUN.

     INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - EARLY MORNING

     We hear the ROAR of the trains pulling out of the station.
     Blurred faces, bodies, suits, hats, attache cases float into
     view pressed like sardines against the sides of a door which
     now open, releasing an outward velocity of anger and greed,
     one of them BUD FOX.

     EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - MORNING

     The bubbling mass charges up the stairs. Steam rises from a
     grating, shapes merging into the crowd. Past the HOMELESS
     VETS, the insane BAG LADY with 12 cats and 20 shopping bags
     huddled in the corner of Trinity Church...

     Bud the Fox straggling behind, in a crumpled raincoat, tie
     askew, young, very young, his bleary face buried in a Wall
     Street Journal, folded, 'subway style', as he crosses the
     street against the light.

                    BUD
          Why Fox? Why didn't you buy...
          schmuck?

     A car honks, swerving past.

     INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

     Cavernous modern lobby. Bodies cramming into elevators. Bud,
     stuffing the newspaper into his coat, jams in.

     INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

     Blank faces stare ahead, each lost in private thoughts, Bud
     again mouthing the thought, "stupid schmuck", his eyes
     catching a blond executive who quickly flicks her eyes away.
     Paranoia in the elevator. We quickly cut into private lives.

                    WORRIED MAN (V.O.)
          ... he'll sue me, could be for 5-6
          million, and he'll get a million,
          the house, they'll impound my
          paychecks...damn, damn, why did I
          sign that contract?

                    BLACK BIKE MESSENGER (V.O.)
          ... gotta get Lola in the sack man,
          take her to the Garden for the
          Terrells, Jimmy give me the tickets
          for 12 bucks, I pull the midnight
          shift, I could do 60 bucks... wow,
          check those legs out...

     His eyes on the same blonde exec who looks away, self-
     conscious about her legs. The elevator stops at a floor,
     discards only one person. The doors close a little too slowly.

                    BLONDE EXECUTIVE (V.O.)
          ... jerk...
               (shifts her thoughts)
          call Hanratty. The decimal points
          on the code are uncalibrated.
          Hoskins. The signatures on the bank
          draft. Boyle, that
          bitch...insurance...tax form. Shit,
          talk to Kahn.
               (recalling)
          That's Hanratty, Hoskins, Bank,
          Boyle and Kahn... H2B2K - shoot,
          insurance and theatre
          tix...H2B2K,I,T -- and the cleaners!
          repeat...

     Catching the eyes of Bud Fox once again wandering to her.
     Camera moving to Bud who looks away.

                    BUD (V.O.)
          ...sorry, what a fox... funny, the
          most beautiful girls in the world
          are always on the street or in
          elevators, never get to talk to
          them, shy ... my looks, never had
          confidence in them ...
          overcompensating work syndrome...
          prove your worth with money...
          'cept I'm not making any money...
               (pause, the elevator
               at another floor, slow)
          ... wonder what all these people
          are thinking about.

     Camera moving slowly again over the eyes. The silence of
     individual tension reigns over all.

                    ANGRY MAN (V.O.)
          ...Screw him! I'll destroy that
          sonufabitch... he thinks he can
          break a contract with me he's got
          something to learn.

                    SECRETARY (V.O.)
          ...9:15!... he'll kill me this
          time, he will really kill me... oh
          come on elevator!... why do you
          stop on every floor...

     As the elevator stops again to disgorge two people.

                    BIKE MESSENGER (V.O.)
               (pissed now at the elevator)
          ... come on man, time is money
          man... One floor here I could do
          eleven blocks...

                    BLONDE EXECUTIVE (V.O.)
          H2B2K,I,T,CL,P,O,T2...
               (pause, she looks
               like she forgot something)


                    WORRIED MAN (V.O.)
          ...goddamn elevators!...people, too
          many goddamn people in this world!

     The elevator finally comes to a slow stop... They wait,
     plead, beg, screech with the eyes.

     The door at last opens. None of them acknowledging each
     other, they all stampede out the door with an audible gasp
     of release, a collective sign akin to making it to a urinal
     after a punishing wait...

     The elevator tension is over, but the killer grind continues.

     INT. JACKSON, STEINEM INVESTMENT HOUSE - DAY

     Credits continue to run. Bud moves past the functional
     reception area, past CAROLYN, a cheerful young black girl.

                    CAROLYN
          How you doing Buddy?

                    BUD
          Great Carolyn, doing any better
          would be a sin...

     He slips off his overcoat, flicks some lint off his Paul
     Stuart $500 suit, and enters the main trading room.

     Brokers mill by their desks, gulping coffee, scanning the
     papers, the quotrons. The digital clock by the big board
     counter clicks to 9:26 am -- four minutes until the market
     opens. You can smell the hunger.

     Bud takes a deep breath, tosses the newspaper away and
     struts into the office -- fuck it -- it's a new day.

     MOVING past DAN STEEPLES, a flush-faced old-timer, a blue
     and white Yale tie, with a carnation in his lapel.

                    BUD
          Morning, Dan. What's looking good
          today?

                    STEEPLES
          If I know I wouldn't be in this
          business. Get out while you're
          young, kid. I came here one day, I
          sat down, and look at me now.

     Past CHARLIE CUSHING, on the phone, a handsome chunk of man
     with rugged good looks and Ivy League mannerisms.

                    BUD
          ...hey Chuckie, how's the woman-
          slayer?

                    CHARLIE
          ...still looking for the right 18
          year old wife, how you doing, pal?

                    BUD
          ...if I had your looks, better.

                    CHARLIE
               (used to it)
          ...takes years of genetics, pal,
          and a Yale education... and the
          right tailor.

                    BUD
          ...not that you learned anything,
          Chunk.

     Bud reaches his trading desk, whips open his briefcase and
     pulls out a computer print-out of last night's homework.

                    BUD
          I gotta feeling we're going to make
          a killing today, Marv.

                    MARV (O.S.)
          Yeah, where's your machine gun.

                    BUD
          Joke about it. I was up all night
          charting these stocks. You want to
          see this or what?

     His associate, MARVIN, a manicky wise-guy, swivels over his
     chair from a nearby desk. He gives the charts a quick read.

                    MARV
               (scowling)
          Looks bearish to me, buddy. You got
          it all upside down.
               (confidential)
          Okay, I'm giving this to you and
          you alone, 'cause I feel sorry for
          you. Take the Knicks against the
          Bullets, and my pick of the day --
          Duke to beat the spread against
          Wake Forest.

                    BUD
          Thanks, Marv, with that I might be
          able to qualify for welfare.

     LOU MANNHEIM, strolls in, a dignified looking older broker
     in his late 60's, wearing an old brown brim hat with button
     down white shirt, narrow tie, very much a picture from
     another era... a kind humor in his eyes... but obviously
     ailing in the legs and breath department.

                    BUD
               (friendly)
          You got a look in your eye, Mr.
          Mannheim... You got something for
          the small fry...

                    MANNHEIM
          Jesus, can't make a buck in this
          market, country's going to hell
          faster than when that sonofabitch
          Roosevelt was around... too much
          cheap money sloshing around the
          world. The biggest mistake we ever
          made was letting Nixon get off the
          gold standard. Putney Drug--you
          boys might want to have a look at it.

                    MARV
          Take 5 years for that company to
          turn around.

                    MANNHEIM
          ...but they got a good new drug.
          Stick to the fundamentals, that's
          how IBM and Hilton were built...good
          things sometimes take time.

     The stentorian voice of OFFICE MANAGER HIERONYMUS LYNCH
     booms over the intercom.

     We see him peering from behind the glass partition in hit
     office; tall, balding with a perpetual worried look on his
     face.

                    LYNCH
          Attention. Please. Office Production
          is down ten percent this week. I
          recommend that you all go through
          your clients' investments for any
          portfolio adjustments. And don't
          forget -- double commissions today
          on our 'A' or better bond funds.
               (looking in Bud and
               Marv's direction)
          Especially you rookies. Also,
          remember, the sales contest ends
          tomorrow.

     Bud and Marvin roll their eyes. The digital clock flashes
     9:30. The CREDITS close.

                    BUD
          And they're off and running!

     The room rises to a subtle but new energy level with the
     clatter of the ticker, speakers, teletype machines,
     newsprinters' Dow Jones and Reuters, phones ringing off the
     hook. Brokers are shouting orders, running for tickets,
     dodging each other; it's a controlled riot.

                    BROKERS
          Here's a hot lead... Have I got one
          for you.... sell ... dump it all!!
          ... 500 at an eighth, an eighth!...
          July fifties. April thirties...how
          bout those Decembers? You see where
          they're going? ... Morgan is
          selling a billion one at the close.
          Yeah. That's right, they're selling
          all over the place... we're still
          long on the treasuries -- $110
          million. What about the Japs?
          ...Where am I?
               (confused at all the
               phone lights)
          We gotta lot of lights here! Let's
          pick 'em up.

                    BUD
               (on phone)
          Jack, take 50 Gulf, with a 3/8 top,
          forget the hundred. What about
          Delroy? I can go long at 23, let's
          go long...Conwest Air -- let me
          check it...

     He looks up at the TICKER... stock quotes whizzing by.

                    BUD (O.S. CONT'D)
          Up an eighth. How many you want?
          It's on the floor.

     He writes the order up.

     A shot of CHARLIE CUSHING yawning as he half-listens to his
     customer, resting the phone on his kneecaps.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

     THE CLOCK... It's 2.30 p.m. We hear the relentless clatter
     of the board ticker, and the drone of disembodied voices,
     blarihg market information out of squawk boxes.

     Bud's desk is now cluttered with order tickets, literature,
     crumpled notes, beverage cups and a half-eaten sandwich.
     He's on the phone and from the look on his face, the caller
     on the other end is breaking his balls. Marvin paces past,
     making a dramatic phone pitch.

                    MARV
          Dr. Beltzer has to have his
          information this minute! It
          concerns his future!

     Bud waves Marvin away, answers his caller, trying to keep
     cool, worried how as he sees Lynch, the office manager,
     coming over.

                    BUD
          Hey Howard, I thought you were a
          gentleman. Sure it's gone down a
          little bit, but you got the tip
          from your printer, I didn't... Yeah
          you did. That's what you said.
               (heated)
          I didn't tell you to buy it, why
          would I tell you to sell it?
               (screaming)
          No, I can't give it back! Give it
          back to who? You own it!
               (beat)
          No, he's out right now.

     As he looks up and winks at Lynch, standing over him.

                    BUD
               (cupping the receiver)
          ... That's what you told us to say.

                    LYNCH
          Give me that phone.
               (takes receiver)
          Yes, sir, this is the manager. What
          seems to be the problem?

                    MARV
               (into his phone)
          What?... Well, how was I to know
          you were in surgery? What am I
          Marvin the mind reader here?

     Bud whispers, tensely. Lynch listens.

                    BUD
          He's lying.

                    LYNCH
          Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with
          the broker and I'll get back to you.
          You're welcome.

     Lynce hangs up and glares at Bud.

                    LYNCH
          If I'm closing out this account. If
          he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you
          pay for it.

                    BUD
          Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!

                    LYNCH
          Fox, you're making more problems
          than you are sales.

                    BUD
          I don't think you're being fair,
          sir. You assigned me this guy, and
          you know he's got a history...

                    LYNCH
          Somebody has to pay for that error.
          And it's not me.

     Lynch walks off. Bud does some quick calculations in his head.

                    MARV
               (reappearing)
          Buddy, buddy, buddy; little
          trouble, huh, today.

                    BUD
               (devastated)
          Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've
          got to cover his loss to the tune
          of about seven grand! I'm tapped
          out man, American Express got a hit
          man looking for me.

                    MARV
          Hey, things could be worse. It
          could've been my money. Let me help
          you out, rookie.

     He takes out his wallet and loans Bud a hundred bucks.

                    BUD
          Thanks Marv, I'll make it good to
          you.
               (fervently)
          You know what my dream is? One day
          to be on the other end of that
          phone...

                    MARV
          Just put me on the institutional
          side of the room where the real
          cheesecake is. You forgetting
          something?

     Marvin points up at the clock. Bud looks up... it's 2:40.
     Bud quickly composes himself. He picks up the phone, dialing
     purposefully.

                    MARV (CONT'D)
          Buddy, buddy, when ya gonna realize
          it's big game hunters that bag the
          elephants, not retail brokers. I
          heard this story about Gekko... he
          was on the phone 30 seconds after
          the Challenger blew up selling NASA
          stocks short.

                    BUD
          Hello, Natalie -- guess who? That's
          right, and you know everyday I say
          to myself, today could be the day...
          So what do you say... will you
          marry me? Then please can you get
          me through to Mr. Gekko?

                    MARV
               (coaching)
          It concerns his future!

                    BUD
          Of course he's busy, and so am I.
          Five minutes. That's all I'm asking.
          I know that if he could only hear
          what I have to say... it would
          change his life.

     INT. GEKKO OFFICE - DAY

     NATALIE, a classy attractive Englishwoman is on the phone
     with Bud, somewhat amused by his manner. She is the personal
     secretary to multimillionaire, Wall Street trader and
     raider, Gordon Gekko. His windows look out on a panoramic
     view of the city and East River.

                    NATALIE
          Mr. Fox, I've told you before, I'm
          sure you're a good broker, but our
          traders talk to the brokers, Mr.
          Gekko only deals with investment
          bankers. Yes, I shall give him your
          message ...

     As they're speaking, another SECRETARY leads two well-heeled
     JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN past her desk. As she opens the door to
     the inner office and ushers them inside, we catch a glimpse
     of a figure, pacing back and forth, talking animatedly on
     the phone by the huge corner window. HE IS GORDON GEKKO. We
     hear a deafening ROAR as we:

                              DISSOLVE TO:

     EXT. MCGREGOR'S BAR AND GRILL - NEAR LAGUARDIA AIRPORT -
     TWILIGHT

     In the background, a 747 ascends into the night sky,
     climbing over the roof tops of weathered brick tract houses.
     Bud, coat collar pulled up against the wind, crosses the
     street, entering a neighborhood bar. We see an old maroon
     Honda behind him.

     INT. MCGREGOR'S - TWILIGHT

     Dimly-lit, noisy, blue-collar airline bar. Machinists and
     mechanics still in their overalls at the bar, drinking,
     watching ESPN FIGHT NIGHT, on TV. Bud searches the crowd. A
     group of middle-aged men wave him over, BLUESTAR AIRLINES
     insignias on the pockets... CHARLIE DENT, a rugged, chain-
     smoking ex-Marine Sergeant, and DOMINICK AMATO, a big strong
     Italian greet Buddy as he comes over.

                    CHARLIE
          Buddy boy, how ya doing?

                    BUD
          Great Charlie, any better it'd be a
          sin.

                    AMATO
               (slapping Bud)
          I hear all you guys on Wall Street
          are millionaires, when you gonna
          make us rich?

                    BUD
          Gotta open an account to win the
          lottery, Dominick. Give me 15,000,
          you'll have a condo in Florida next
          Christmas.

                    CARL
          ... sure and we'll own the airline.
          If he makes anybody rich, let him
          make himself rich, so's he can pay
          off his school loans.

     As he signs an unemployment insurance form for one of his men.

                    BUD
          ... nice to see you in such a good
          mood Dad, what'd Mom do, give you
          fish for dinner? ... You're smoking
          too much, how many times do you
          gotta go to the hospital to ...

     Carl, inhaling his cigarette, grimaces formidably,
     terminating the subject.

                    CARL
          ...leave me alone willya. Only
          thing makes me feel good anymore.
          Spaghetti. She makes lousy
          spaghetti...

                    BUD
          It's called pasta now Dad,
          spaghetti's out of date.

     Bud sitting down next to him, pats him around the shoulder.
     Dad, a sarcastic and gruff edge to him, makes a faint smile.
     He has a genuine affection and pride in his somewhat
     glamorous son.

                    CARL
          ... so am I. Whaddaya want, a beer?
               (to waitress)
          Hey Billie, bring another for the
          kid, he looks good, doesn't he?

     Dominick and Charlie go off. A pause. Father and son sizing
     each other up with a look.

                    CARL
          ... looks like you grown another
          inch... but you don't look so hot,
          getting bags under your eyes,
          starting to look old like me.

                    BUD
          Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk
          D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.

                    CARL
          Speak English will ya.

                    BUD
          D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was
          when the options he bought took a
          bath. He reneged on me.

                    CARL
               (nods, satisfied)
          I told you not to go into that
          racket. You could've been a doctor
          or a lawyer,

                    BUD
          Coulda been a contender.

                    CARL (CONT.)
          you coulda stayed at Bluestar and
          been a supervisor in instead of
          going customer relations by now,
          'stead of going off and bein' a
          salesman.

                    BUD
               (an old story between them)
          Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How
          many times I gotta tell you I'm an
          account executive, and pretty soon
          I'm going to the investment banking
          side of the firm.

                    CARL
          You get on the phone and ask
          strangers for their money, right?
          You're a salesman.
      
               BUD
               (ticked)
          Dad, it takes time. You gotta build
          a customer list. I'm doing it. I
          could make more money in one year
          as a broker than five years at the
          airline.

                    CARL
          I don't get it, you get a
          scholarship to NYU, you get 35,000
          the first year, and 50 last year,
          where the hell is it?

                    BUD
          50 K don't get you to first base in
          the Big Apple, Dad, not any more. I
          pay 40% in taxes, I got a rent of
          15,000, I got school loans, car
          loans, food, park my car costs me 3
          bills a month, I need good suits,
          that's $500 a pop, shoes...

                    CARL
          So come home and live rent free,
          'stead of that cockroach palace you
          live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the
          world is off its rocker. I made
          $37,000 last year and you...

                    BUD
          It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage
          and you rent the top room--I gotta
          live in Manhattan to be a player,
          Dad. There's no nobility in poverty
          anymore, y'know. One day you're
          going to be proud of me, you'll
          see...
               (hurting)

                    CARL
               (sees it)
          It's yourself you've got to be
          proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya
          need?

                    BUD
               (beat)
          Can you spare three hundred? Pay
          you back next month, promise.

     Dad reaches into his pocket, looks at his cash. It hurts.
      
               CARL
          ...Got a 100 on me, you...

                    BUD
               (embarrassed)
          Not in here Dad... please. Later.

     Dad shrugs, puts it away.

                    CARL
          ... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200
          there. Your brother never...
               (cuts off when he
               sees Buddy's face)
          ...well, I always said money is
          something you need in case you
          don't die tomorrow...

                    BUD
               (changes subject)
          How's Mom?

     Another man comes over with a bandage around his head and a
     compensation form for Carl to sign. ("Hey, chief").

                    CARL
               (with affection)
          ...same, pain in the ass, god bless
          her, talks too much... gonna take
          her to Florida next month... west
          coast, near Tampa, like to get out
          for good, but can't afford it.

                    BUD
          ...Work okay?

                    CARL
               (lights another
               cigarette, grimaces)
          ...this drug testing is driving my
          guys nuts. I got flagged for my
          blood pressure pills. The only good
          news is, we just met with the
          comptroller over some union
          stuff...'member that crash last
          summer? and the investigation?
          Well, the FAA is gonna rule it was
          a manufacturing flaw in the door
          latch mechanism. I kept telling 'em
          it wasn't maintenance, it was those
          goddamn greedy manufacturers out in
          Cincinnati. And I was right.

     He gives the signed form back to the injured man. (Carl:
     "Okay, Frank")

                    BUD
          That's great Dad.

                    CARL
          Damn right, it gets us out from
          under suspension. We'll get those
          new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston
          and the equipment we need. We're
          gonna compete with the big boys now.

                    BUD
               (boasts)
          Hey to Bluestar, as your broker all
          I can advise is hold on to that
          stock Dad...

     They drink. Bud reflects a moment.

                    BUD
          You sure about this FAA announcement?

                    CARL
          About what?

                    BUD
          The FAA announcement.

                    CARL
          Sure I'm sure. Buddy, you got that
          mischievous look in your eyes. You
          used to smile just like that when
          you were a baby sleeping, just like
          that.

     Bud's mind racing elsewhere.

     INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

     A cramped studio facing an air shaft with bars on the window.
     Moving across to the sound of the radio alarm going off and
     the glib tones of a rock D.J. announcing the Met's latest
     streak ... The walls are papered with stock analyses and
     graphs, print out pages strewn across the floor. No other
     semblance of a personal life except clothes haphazardly
     tossed, Barron's and Fortune magazines. A GIRL's back is all
     we see, sleeping naked on the bed.

     Close on Bud's IBM computer -- his appointment calendar. Bud
     focusing on an underlined notation: G.G.'s BIRTHDAY.

     Bud stares at the clock: 4 a.m. He picks up a prospectus for
     a chemical company, starts reading.

     EXT. GEKKO BUILDING - MORNING

     Bud, crossing lower Broadway, enters a magnificent towering
     glass structure.

     INT. GORDON GEKKO PENTHOUSE OFFICES - MORNING

     NATALIE, Gekko's British secretary, is completing shorthand
     notes as the intercom buzzes. A logo for "GEKKO & CO. is
     behind her.

                    RECEPTION
               (off)
          ... I have a delivery here for Mr.
          Gekko. It's a personal item and the
          gentleman says you have to sign for
          it.

                    NATALIE
               (frowning)
          ...all right, send him in...

     INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

     Bud, somewhat nervous, is led down an impressive hallway
     hung with expensive modern art... past a huge Calder mobile
     and a pool of some 15 traders on phones, quotron terminals
     and keyboards... into Natalie's outer office.

                    BUD
          Hello, Natalie, you recognize the
          voice? I'll give you a hint, you're
          thinking seriously about marrying
          me...

                    NATALIE
               (recognizing the voice)
          What are you doing here?

                    BUD
          ...And you're even lovelier than I
          pictured. I brought a birthday
          present for Mr. Gekko.

                    NATALIE
          First of all, Mr. Fox, you can't
          just come barging in here. And what
          makes you think it's his birthday?

     Bud takes out an old crumpled Fortune magazine cover of
     Gordon Gekko, entitled "Gekko the Great!"

                    BUD
          It's in the bible, see. You better
          go buy him a present. Please,
          Natalie. Let me give him the gift;
          Cuban cigars--Davidoff, his
          favorite and hard to get.

                    NATALIE
               (sighs)
          Stay here, I'll see what I can do.

     She takes the gift and enters Gekko's office. Bud paces
     nervously. Natalie re-appears, stern, but a note of
     compromise in her voice.

                    NATALIE
          Wait outside.

     INT. GEKKO OFFICES - OUTSIDE RECEPTION AREA - DAY

     Bud on the courtesy phone, hangs up, looks nervously at his
     watch. Almost 12. He's lost some two hours of business.
     Natalie suddenly comes out, without a smile.

                    NATALIE
          Five minutes...

     Bud brightens, pumping himself in the mirror, muttering.

                    BUD
               (to Natalie)
          Well... life all comes down to a
          few moments, and this is one of 'em...

     He follows Natalie.

     INT. GORDON GEKKO'S OFFICE (BUD'S POV) - DAY

     Furnishings in hypermodern gray and black lacquer, Modern
     Art ranging from black field paintings by Ad Reinhardt to
     the smashed dishes of Julian Schnabel. Nautilus equipment,
     hi-tech gadgets are in evidence, including a splendid Howard
     Miller World Time Clock, and a world map...

     Three of Gekko's people, young MBA's dressed for success,
     are scattered about the room, on phones, calculators, coming
     in and out.

     GORDON GEKKO aka Gekko the Great as the media calls him,
     dressed in a custom English suit, paces on the phone with
     the restlessness of a caged tiger, a 50-foot extension cord
     attached to his blinking 130 line silver-plated telephone.
     On his ears is a headset.

     He is carrying on overlapping conversations with a myriad of
     bankers, partners and lawyers; pausing to issue commands to
     his aides while keeping his eye on the stock prides spitting
     across a bank of quotron monitors, carrying everything from
     New York Exchanges to London, commodities, gold, and
     currency values. A second Secretary and sometimes Natalie
     exit and enter with various messages written on a piece of
     paper, indicating a waiting party on the phone. Gekko often
     shakes his head "no".

                    GEKKO
               (on phone)
          ... what the hell is going on? I
          just saw 200,000 shares move, are
          we part of it, we better be, pal,
          or I'm gonna eat your lunch for
          you... get on 1.
               (switches lines)
          Sorry, love it at forty. It's an
          insult at fifty. Their analysts
          don't know preferred stock from
          livestock...
               (a beat, mischievous smile)
          wait for it to head south, then
          we'll raise the sperm count on the
          deal... right. Get back to me....
               (to Alex, an aide
               listening an the
               other line)
          This is the kid that's called me 59
          days in a row. Wants to be a player
               (to Bud)
          There oughta be a picture of you in
          the dictionary under persistence.
               (back to phone)
          Look, Jerry, I'm looking for
          negative control, no more than 30
          to 35%, just enouqh to block
          anybody else's merger plans and
          find out from the inside if the
          books are cooked. If it looks as
          good as on paper, we're in the kill
          zone. We lock and load pal...get on 3.

     ALEX DE BETANCOURT, a tall handsome Frenchman, jots a note
     and follows Gordon over to line 3. Gekko's dark intent eyes
     fixing briefly on Bud who stands waiting in the corner. He
     motions him to sit.

                    GEKKO
               (new line)
          Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?...
          No, not interested.
               (eyes an Quotron, to
               Ollie, a trader)
          Ollie, start calling a the
          institutions, start with Marx at
          Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me
          that California retirement money,
          baby! And we're on our way!

                    OLLIE
          You got it, G.G.

     OLLIE, a gigantic 200 pound man wearing pink suspenders,
     rises and walks to another phone, past Bud...

                    GEKKO
               (back on line with
               Billy, listening)
          ... check the arbs for MacDonald's.
          Yeah, I'm having a Mac attack.
          20,000 shares. For about 30 minutes.
          Lunch? Are you joking -- lunch is
          for wimps. Get back to me...
               (to Alex)
          4.

     Bud's eyes on the framed "tombstones" from the Wall Street
     Journal commemorating Gekko's successful deals; they hang
     like scalps from the walls. Gekko's eyes drifting to Bud, a
     friendly easy smile for a flick of an instant, he has
     genuine charm in his manner and though ultrafast verbally,
     projects calm and confidence at the center. A man who
     obviously loves what he does, to some small degree is
     flashing his stuff for the outsider.

                    GEKKO
               (line 4)
          Look Harold, they're vulnerable,
          alright, but we don't want 'em to
          think they're under accumulation.
          Go slow. Call Geneva and the
          Bahamas for me, will ya? We feint
          towards it but we wait...

                    ALEX
          What about tipping off Yurovich?

                    GEKKO
               (grimaces)
          If I ever need surgery, get me the
          heart of an arb like Yurovich, it's
          never been used...Happy Holideals
          Harold...

     Hangs up, eyes to Bud. His headset comes off.

                    BUD
               (nervous)
          How do you do Mr. Gekko. I'm Bud Fox.

                    GEKKO
          So you say. Nice to meet you; hope
          you're intelligent. Like these,
          how'd you get these?
               (indicating cigars)


                    BUD
               (tries a smile, awkward)
          ...got a connection at the airport.

     Gekko notes the answer, wrapping the cuff of a state-of-the-
     art, automatic blood pressure monitor around his arm and
     starts pumping it up. His aides continue on the phones.

                    GEKKO
          So what s on your mind kimosabe?
          Why am I listening to you? Got to
          monitor my blood pressure, so
          whatever you do, don't upset me.

                    BUD
          Oh no, no...

                    GEKKO
               (demonstrating it)
          Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor
          computes your systolic and
          diastolic pressure. Has an LCD
          readout, and it's cost effective --
          less than one visit to the doctor.

                    BUD
          I just want to let you know Mr.
          Gekko I read all about you at NYU
          Business, and I think you're an
          incredible genius and I've always
          dreamed of only one thing -- to do
          business with a man like you...

                    GEKKO
               (smiles, impatient
               with the speech)
          So what firm you with, pal?

                    BUD
          Jackson, Steinem...

                    GEKKO
               (nods)
          ...going places, good junk bond
          department, you got the financing
          on that Syndicam deal.

                    BUD
          ...Yeah, and we're working on some
          other interesting stuff.

                    GEKKO
               (fishing)
          ...A cosmetics company by any
          chance? What are you, the 12th man
          on the deal team? The last to know?

                    BUD
               (smiles)
          Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.

                    GEKKO
          So whatta you got for me, sport?
          Why are you here?

     Bud opens his attache case and rifles out a handful of
     briefs. Gekko noting the blood pressure reading and taking
     the cuff off his arm. Ollie, the big trader, ambles back in,
     says something to the third aide, a young intelligent-
     looking woman SUSAN TURNER.

                    BUD
          Chart break-out on this one
          here...uh Whitewood-Young
          Industries...low P.E. Explosive
          earnings. 30% discount from book.
          Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders.
          Strong management.

                    GEKKO
          It's a dog, what else you got,
          sport, besides connections at the
          airport?

                    NATALIE
          Mr. Stevenson in San Fransisco.

     Gekko takes the call, cutting Bud off.

                    GEKKO
          He respond to the offer? What? What
          the hell's Cromwell doing giving
          lecture tours when his company's
          losing 60 million a quarter? I
          guess he's giving lectures on how
          to lose money...if this guy opened
          a funeral parlor, no one would die,
          this turkey's totally brain
          dead...Well Christmas is over and
          business is business.
               (simultaneous to Ollie)
          Keep buying. Dilute the sonofabitch.
          Ollie I want every orifice in his
          body flowing red.

                    OLLIE
               (laughs, on the phone)
          He's flowing, Gordo. Piece of cake.

     Gekko hanging up and buzzing an aide. Throws out an aside to
     Bud.

                    GEKKO
          ...doesn't look like it but the
          best trader on the street...
               (to Susan)
          Sue get the LBO analysis on Teldar
          Paper and bring it here...what else?

     Bud shifting, uncomfortable as Gekko finally swivels his
     attention back to him.

                    BUD
               (coming right back)
          Tarafly...Analysts don't like it. I
          do. The breakup value is twice the
          market price. The deal finances
          itself. Sell off two divisions,
          keep...

     Aiex, knowing the stock, sneers, shares a look with Gekko
     who looks up at Bud with the first sign of interest.

                    GEKKO
               (laughs)
          Not bad for a quant, but a dog with
          different fleas.
               (checks his hi-tech watch)
          Come on, tell me something I don't
          know. It's my birthday, pal,
          surprise me...

     As he opens a birthday card and feeds it into the SHREDDER
     that sits next to his desk over the waste basket. The sound
     it makes is soft and menacing. Buddy knows its fourth down
     and long, Gekko's attention is shifting to the quotron. In
     frustration, Bud blurts it out.

                    BUD
               (standing)
          Bluestar Airlines.

     The camera moves on him now, sudden, more intense, in a
     sense trapping him.

                    GEKKO
          ...rings a bell somewhere. So what?

                    BUD
          A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300
          pilots, flies northeast, Canada,
          some Florida and Caribbean routes...
          great slots in major cities...

                    GEKKO
          ...don't like airlines, lousy
          unions...

                    BUD
          There was a crash last year. They
          just got a favorable ruling on a
          lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't
          know.

     Gekko looks up, remotely interested.

                    GEKKO
          How do you know?

                    BUD
               (hesitates, concerned)
          I know...the decision'll clear the
          way for new planes and route
          contracts. There's only a small
          float out there, so you should grab
          it. Good for a five point pop.

     Ollie comes back in, as excited as he ever will get under
     his rolls of flesh, his voice deadpan.

                    OLLIE
          ... just got 250,000 shares at 18
          1/4 from Janson, think I'll pull
          twice that at 18 1/2 outta the
          California pensions. We got close
          to half a million shares in the bag.

                    GEKKO
          Hey, the Terminator! Blow 'em away
          Ollie.

                    OLLIE
          And, I'm pretty sure we got the
          Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming
          in with us and I'm working on the
          Silverberg boys in Canada.

                    GEKKO
          Rip their throats out and put them
          in your garbage compactor.
               (to Bud)
          Interesting. You got a card?

     Buddy thrusts a card into his hands. Gekko glances at it.

                    BUD
          My home number's on the back...

                    GEKKO
               (smiles, looks at card)
          Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas
          a day. I choose one.

     Bud stuffs his notes back into the briefcase, hoping for a
     word of encouragement in the awkward silence.

                    BUD
          Well, hope to hear from you, sir.

     He turns and heads out the door, still shaken by the
     revelation he has made passing Susan who hurries in with a
     dossier.

     Gekko glances at it. As Bud leaves, he overhears:

                    GEKKO
               (off)
          OK gang, looks like we're going
          over 5% in Teldar, start the
          lawyers on a tender offer and 13D,
          we keep going after everything in
          sight but don't pay over $22.
          They're gonna fight, they got Myers
          and Thromberg doing their legal,
          they make Nazis look like nice guys...

     INT. OUTSIDE GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bud walks glumly past Natalie, certain that he's blown it.
     She's busy on the phone.

                    BUD
          ...thanks Natalie.

                    NATALIE
               (buzzing inside, preoccupied)
          ...have a nice day Mr. Stone.
               (wrong name, doesn't
               notice, to Gekko on phone)
          ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call
          is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr.
          Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in
          Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms.
          Rosco in London. They're all on.

     The phone call goes behind closed doors. Bud walks out,
     dejected.

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bud comes in, distracted, punches into his quatron. Teldar
     Paper comes up.

                    MARV
               (comes over)
          ...well, see him?

                    BUD
               (mind on the computer)
          Yeah, but he didn't see me.

                    MARV
          Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook
          Gekko the Great's hand and you
          still got all your fingers. He's
          not the only elephant in the jungle.

     INSERT: TELDAR PAPER. The quotron. Bud's eyes. Thinking to buy.

                    MARV
               (looks)
          ... got something from him? Teldar
          Paper?

     Bud wipes it off the screen, his mind made up, dismissing
     the temptation to buy.

                    BUD
          ...a dog with fleas.

     Lynch, the manager, stalks past with some telexes.

                    LYNCH
          Where you been the last 3 hours,
          Fox? I wouldn't be sitting around
          chin wagging if I were you...
          plenty of names in that phone book
          to cold call...

     Marvin gives Lynch the Italian salute, behind his back.
     Grudgingly, Buddy flips open the massive New York phone book.

                    MARV
          ...got tickets for the Knicks
          tonight. Go out and cruise some
          bimbos afterwards, whaddaya say?

                    BUD
               (shakes his head)
          ...gotta read my reports.

                    MARV
          Forget charts! We're not fund
          managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn
          'em. I'm offering you the Knicks
          and chicks. God save you before you
          turn into poor Steeples over there.

     Their eyes briefly on DAN STEEPLES, red faced, desperately
     trying to make a sale on the telephone, hangs up defeated.

                    BUD
          ...preferably Lou Mannheim...

     Their eyes briefly on LOU MANNHEIM, in his private office,
     sitting there slumped, thinking, smoking as he watches the
     quotron.

                    MARV
          Nice guy but a loser. Lost all his
          equity when his firm went belly up
          in the recession of 71. you wanna
          be coming in here in your late
          sixties still pitching? ...
          Whatever happened to that cute
          analyst at Thudder, Wicks? ...
          Cindy? Susan?

                    BUD
          Cindy. Having sex with her is like
          reading the Wall Street Journal
          'cept the Journal don't talk back.
          'Sides this AIDS crap is ruining
          romance, nobody trusts anybody
          anymore, gotta get a blood test in
          the toilet before you leave a bar
          together, somebody oughtta invent
          an AIDS dipstick, no kidding, make
          a fortune. I gotta get to work...
          Z's today.
               (hitting the phone
               with the directory)

     The pool SECRETARY, GINA, calls out.

                    GINA
          Call for you Buddy.

                    BUD
               (taking it)
          Bud Fox.

     Bud rears up in his seat. A change. Marvin notices.

     INT. GORDON GEKKO OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS - DAY

     Gekko talks into his speaker phone, gazing out the window.

                    GEKKO
          Alright Bud Fox... buy me twenty
          thousand shares of Bluestar. No
          more than 15 1/8, 3/8 tops, and
          don't screw it up sport.

     INT. BUD'S CUBICLE - DAY

     The camera tracks around and in on him climactically as the
     Music Theme rises to ensnare him... We end close on Bud.
     Dumbstruck.

                    BUD
          Yes, sir. Thank you. You won't
          regret it.

     He hangs up, stunned still, rises from his chair, unbuttons
     his collar and feverishly starts writing the ticket.

                    MARV
          Got a little action there, eh buddy?

                    BUD
          Marv,
               (turns triumphant)
          ...I just bagged the elephant!

     EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE - NIGHT

     The upper West Side. The young, the rich and the restless
     parade along the avenue, jamming the neighborhood restaurants
     and bars. Bud glides along, feeling a part of the crowd now,
     past a dreadlocked DERELICT swigging Thunderbird and
     shouting obscenities, shaking a wooden African spear.

     INT. RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT

     Inside a glitzy neighborhood singles bar in which Bud stops,
     everybody seems to be young and drinking margueritas. Bud
     orders a beer, surveying the room like a veteran, overhearing
     the conversation of a YOUNG TRADER to two other broker types.

                    YOUNG TRADER
          ...you know Marty Wyndham? He
          netted $650,000 out of that
          merger...26 years old, the guy's
          Rambo. Got himself a Porsche Turbo
          Cabriolet about 75 thou, got a
          house in Westhampton, penthouse on
          Second Avenue, gets up at 2:30 in
          the morning, he's in the office at
          4...guy never sleeps...Rambo genes...

     He blathers on as Bud surveys the room, noticing an ELEGANT
     BLONDE with a striking aloof beauty, very much the debutante
     dream Grace Kelly type, so refined that you wonder what she
     could possibly be doing out at night in public alone.

     Bud summons his courage, catches his breath, makes his way
     over... She sees him approach, obviously doesn't wish to
     talk, eyes darting elsewhere like a nervous deer.

                    BUD
               (awkward)
          Hi...can I buy you a drink? I'm
          celebrating tonight.

                    BLONDE
               (disdainful)
          Please, no thanks...
               (looking away)

                    BUD
          Look, I know you get approached a
          lot by dubious men, but I'm
          different, I never talk to
          strangers, all my life I've been
          waiting for the right person to
          walk across the room...
          you're that person, you don't know
          it but I do and if you walk away
          now I'll never see you again or you
          me. You'll grow old.

                    BLONDE
          Oh really.

                    BUD (CONT'D)
          I'll grow old. We'll both die. And
          we'll never have known each other.
          That's sad. At least one drink for
          a dreamer...What's your favorite
          drink?

     She looks at him, not quite sure. Is he serious or glib?

                    BLONDE
               (uncommitted)
          Grand Marnier.

                    BUD
          Sounds like a french word, what is it?

                    BLONDE
          It's a romantic and tragic drink.

                    BUD
          Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with
          a twist of fate. You know like us
          meeting. Don't go away...

     Maybe, just maybe she's his! His eyes show it as he hurries
     back to the bar to order. As he gets the bartender's
     attention, he turns and sees that she is joined by a MAN who
     looks as if he stepped out of the pages of GQ. Together they
     walk away. Stung, Bud watches as the woman of his dreams
     disappears out the door.

                    BARTENDER
          What do you want?

                    BUD
          ...I just lost it.

     EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT (RAIN)

     Bud and a DATE he's obviously just picked up, are struggling
     to be seen in a mass of people trying to get in the hottest
     new club in Manhattan. Bud easing forward along the ropes to
     a large BOUNCER who roughly pushes one of the bridge-and-
     tunnel kids back across the rope.

     Joe discreetly shows him $50 but they guy says: "No room!,"
     humiliating him in front of his date. The bouncer shoving
     Bud aside as Gordon Gekko and KATE, his wife, and ENTOURAGE
     (ALEX, others) are shown through the ropes into the door.
     Bud says something to Gordon but it gets lost in the confusion.

     EXT. 79TH STREET & BROADWAY - EARLY DAY

     People pouring into the subway on the way to work. Bud
     rifles through the Financial Times he's just bought at the
     newsstand and finds the article he was looking for: BLUESTAR
     EXONERATED IN 1984 CRASH. He thrusts his fist in the air,
     victoriously...bounds down the subway stairs.

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bud's on the quotron and the phone; the word's spread around
     the office, he's landed Gekko and brokers drop by his desk
     to get the lowdown.

                    BUD
               (on the phone)
          What's it at now? Still moving. Great!

                    STEEPLES
          The man of the day. Pour some water
          on him to cool him off...one of
          these days I want to know how you
          got Gekko's account.

                    BUD
               (indicating Dan's
               Yale tie)
          My magic tie, Dan.

                    STEEPLES
          I'll trade you.

     Lou Mannheim and a Chinese LADY BROKER intersect.

                    CHINESE LADY
          Gordo the Great, way to go.

                    MANNHEIM
               (pleased)
          Good little company. I remember
          when we got the money for Bluestar
          to build those first planes, back
          in the fifties.

                    CHINESE LADY
               (to Bud)
          I hear you're buying Teldar.

     Bud smiles back at her mischievously.

                    BUD
          Sleep with me and the secrets of
          the West are yours.

                    MANNHEIM
          Now that's a crap company, sure
          you'll make money on the takeover
          rumor, but what's being created.
          Nothing. No substance behind it.

                    BUD
               (succinct)
          Old values. Buy.

     She hears him. As they go, Marvin swivels madly over in his
     chair.

                    MARV
          Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why
          didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.

                    BUD
          Hey Marv, he demanded
          confidentiality...

                    MARV
          Gimme a break. You buy Bluestar
          Airlines yesterday. Today they just
          happen to get good news and the
          stock goes bat shit. You must have
          ESP. A real Nostradamus.
               (Bud ignoring him,
               picking up the phone)
          Jesus Christ, what are friends for?

                    BUD
          All right, I owe you one Marv.

                    MARV
          That's right, next time a little
          birdie talks to you, talk to me too
          E.F. Hutton.

                    GINA
               (pool secretary)
          Buddy, phone...Gordon Gekko!

     Everybody in the adjacent area turns and looks at Buddy like
     in an E.F. Hutton commercial.

                    BUD
               (on phone)
          Hi Natalie...lunch at 21?
               (looks at watch)
          I'm out the door...

     As he springs up to leave, Lynch the manager happens to be
     strolling by. He nods pleasantly at Buddy.

                    LYNCH
          Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't
          you join me and the partners for
          lunch tomorrow in the dining room?

                    BUD
          I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.

     INT. 21 CLUB - DAY

     Dark mahagony wood, plush banquettes, a long oak bar. Bud
     enters the main dining room in a relatively outre suit that
     hangs on him embarrassingly as other businessmen in well-cut
     suits move around him and a Maitre d' sniffs, then leads him
     to where Gekko is parked, finishing up his lunch. A half
     finished plate is removed to make way for Bud.

                    GEKKO
          Hi sport.

                    BUD
               (still nervous)
          Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.

     He's seated.

                    GEKKO
          Try the steak tartare. It's off the
          menu but Louis'll make it for you...

                    MAITRE D'
          Of course sir. And to drink?

     He looks at Gekko's bottled water.

                    BUD
          Uh...just a Evian, thank you...

     The Maitre d' leaves. Gekko proudly pulls a tiny 3" by 6"
     color television out of his pocket with a 2" diagonal
     screen, flips it on to the Dow Jones avarages.

                    GEKKO
          See this? Can you believe it? Two
          inch screen...

                    BUD
          ...I can't even see it...

                    GEKKO
          ...for my kid Rudy -- 3 years old,
          electronics freak, got a liquid
          crystal display 'stead of an
          electronic beam. We're going into a
          new age pal. So how's business today.

                    BUD
          Bluestar was at 21 and an eighth
          when I left the office. It might
          spin up to 25 by the bell...

                    GEKKO
               (a tiny smile)
          Teldar's shooting up. Buy any for
          yourself? Bet you were on the phone
          two minutes after you got out of my
          office.

                    BUD
               (flushes)
          No sir, that would've been illegal...

                    GEKKO
               (doesn't believe him)
          Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna
          blow a whistle. Here, is this
          legal?...you wanna put it in my
          account?

     As he fishes a check out and drops it on Bud's plate.

     Greeting TWO BANKERS who stop at the table as Bud picks up
     the check, glances at it. His hand starts to tremble.

     The check is for $500,000.

                    GEKKO
               (to bus boy, the
               bankers excited)
          Can we have the check over here for
          christ's sake.

                    BUS BOY
               (rushing off)
          Yes sir!

                    GEKKO
          Cover the Bluestar buy and put a
          couple hundred thou in one of those
          bow-wow stocks you mentioned. Pick
          the dog with the least fleas. Use a
          stop loss so your downside is
          50,000, and buy yourself a decent
          suit. You can't come in here
          looking like that.
               (Bud flushes, embarassed)
          Go to Morty Sills, Tell 'em I sent
          you.

                    BUD
               (his genuine look)
          Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the
          chance. You won't regret this,
          you're with a winner.

                    GEKKO
               (paying the check
               with cash)
          ...put the rest of it in a money
          market account for now. I want to
          see what you know before I invest
          it...and save the cheap salesman
          talk, it's obvious.

                    BUD
               (stung)
          Excuse me sir.

     Gekko rising to leave, the Maitre d' hovering around.

                    GEKKO
          You heard me...I don't like losses
          sport. Nothing ruins my day more
          than losses... You do good, you get
          perks, all kinds of perks. Stay
          home tonight. Louis, take care of
          'im. Enjoy the lunch.

     Confused, Bud watches Gekko walk out of the room, pumping
     extended hands left and right. He holds the cashiers check
     up to his eyes, entranced by it, like a kid with his first
     dollar...as the raw steak tartare with an egg on top is put
     in front of him.

     INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Bud is at his computer when the door bell rings. He's not
     expecting a visitor. When he opens the door he is knocked
     for a loop.

     A smashing looking LADY in a fitted Chanel suit, ropes of
     chains, short tight skirt, beautiful long legs, is standing
     there. Taking in the apartment, she hides her distaste.

                    LISA
          Hello Bud, I'm Lisa, a friend of
          Gordon's.

                    BUD
               (in a daze)
          Lisa. Gordon? Oh, Mr. Gekko. Sure.
          Would you, uh, like to come in?

                    LISA
          Didn't he tell you?
               (sighs)
          That's so like Gordon. Get dressed,
          we're going out.

                    BUD
          We are?

     EXT. BUD'S BUILDING - NIGHT

     A stretch limo is parked in front, neighborhood WINOS
     inspecting it. The CHAUFFEUR opens the back door, as Lisa
     steps inside, Buddy in tow. The winos clap, howling at her.

     INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

     Bud in the back seat next to Lisa, gazes out the black
     tinted window as they drive away, then turns to her as she
     gives him a bottle of Champagne to open.

                    BUD
          So, where are we going?

                    LISA
          Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the
          River Cafe...or maybe we can just
          drive around for a while.
               (provocatively)
          Work up an appetite.

     She crosses her legs. Bud's eyes moving south. He pops the
     cork. Lisa does a little blow, offers him.

                    LISA
          Want some?
               (he shorts)
          Gordon tells me you're a very
          talented broker. What do you like?

                    BUD
               (feeling the rush)
          Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...

                    LISA
          I got this guy who should know
          tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I
          been burned on tips. What do you
          think Bud?

                    BUD
          Let's see, it closed at uh, 41
          1/8...
               (his voice cracking)
          Up a quarter...very attractive...
          about average yield...

     She unzips his fly.

                    BUD
          Rising profits...strong balance
          sheets, good earnings per share.

                    LISA
               (removing her blouse)
          So you're hot on this stock?

                    BUD
               (nods, moaning)
          It's ready to take off. I'd jump
          all over it if I were you.

     As she pulls up her skirt and climbs on top of Buddy.

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - MORNING

     Buddy, in an obviously new Mort Sills suit, struts past
     Carolyn at the reception desk, in high spirits.

                    CAROLYN
               (smiles)
          Morning Buddy, you look happy.

                    BUD
          Any better and I'd be guilty.

                    CAROLYN
               (picking up the flow)
          You were never that innocent sugarpie.

                    BUD
               (coyly)
          ...how do you know? You wish...

                              WIPE TO:

     Bud on the phone, gazing at the ticker, concern in his eyes.
     CLICKING of the tape ticker comes up over the music. He
     looks at Marv.

                              WIPE TO:

     Later. Research reports piling up. Bud's secretary trying to
     get his attention. Bud's concern growing, as the green
     fluorescent numbers spit across the board. CLICKER growing
     louder. Pan to Marvin, hands cupped in prayer. To Dan
     Steeples who closes his eyes and shakes his head.

                              WIPE TO:

     Close. Bud watching the tape -- dizzying, hypnotic blur of
     numbers. The roar of the clicker, drowning out the music...a
     runaway freight train.

                              WIPE TO:

     Bud's hands clamped over his eyes. The numbers stop. Noise
     recedes. He opens his eyes, looks down at his desk, stacked
     with reports and phone messages, as the pool secretary,
     GINA, calls out. Marvin glumly coasts over in his chair.

                    MARV
          Boy, we sure went down the toilet
          on that ugly bitch. If we were
          Japs, we'd have to stay with our
          aircraft.

                    GINA
               (calls out)
          Mr. Gekko's office is after you. Be
          at the Wyatt Club courts at six...

     Bud looks worried, at Marvin.

     INT. WYATT CLUB SQUASH COURTS - DAY

     Games in progress on the four courts, heavy hitting sounds.
     Crossing to Gekko and Bud going at it. Bud is obviously the
     worse for wear.

                    GEKKO
               (amused)
          ...come on sport, you gotta try
          harder, I need some exercise for
          chrissake...

                    BUD
               (out of breath)
          Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go
          on.

                    GEKKO
          ...finish out the game, Bud, push
          yourself...

     Meant paternally or sadistically, it's hard to tell. Gekko
     hits the ball, a big fat shot. Bud returns, Gekka moves him
     around the court, as if punishing him, the kid exhausted but
     the ball's never quite out of reach -- till Bud finally
     can't take it anymore and at the end of his breath, smashes
     into the wall and collapses. Gekko laughs. Bud lying there
     like a sad dog as Gekka hauls him up.

                    GEKKO
          The public is out there throwing
          darts at a board, sport. I don't
          throw darts at a board. I only bet
          sure things. Read Sun Tzu's "The
          Art of War." 'every battle is won
          before it is ever fought.' Think
          about it.

     He exits the squash court.

     INT. WYATT CLUB STEAM ROOM - DAY

     Gekko and Bud sit alone, wreathed in steam.

                    BUD
               (sweating)
          Nice club, Mr. Gekko...

                    GEKKO
          Yeah... not bad for a City College
          boy. Bought my way into this club
          and now every one of these ivy
          league schmucks is sucking my
          kneecaps...I just got on the Board
          of the Zoological Society, cost me
          a million; that's the thing with
          WASPS -- they like animals but they
          can't stand people!

                    BUD
               (easing into it)
          Uh, Mr. Gekko, we took a little
          loss today. We got stopped out on
          Tarafly...
               (Gekko waits)
          ...about 50 thousand.

     Gekko's expression is frightening but cool.

                    GEKKO
          I guess your father's not a union
          representative on that company.

                    BUD
               (laughs, shocked)
          What? How do you know about my father?

                    GEKKO
          The most valuable commodity I know
          of is information. Wouldn't you
          agree on that?

                    BUD
               (exhaling deeply)
          Yes...

     INT. WYATT CLUB LOCKER ROOM - DAY

     Buddy is slumped on a bench after taking a shower, drinking
     a Coke. Gekko towelling himself down, getting dressed...naked
     man constantly stopping by to greet him. Hi Fred, hi Barry,
     how's the wife...still living in Larchmont? Yeah, still
     commuting... y'ever do anything with that Aetna Gas
     deal...nah...fishing for information, for a possible drink
     or meeting but Gekko stonewalls them all...

                    GEKKO
          You're not as smart as I thought
          you were, Buddy boy, Listen hard --
          don't count on Graham and Dodd to
          make you a fortune, everybody in
          the market knows the theory, ever
          wonder why fund managers can't beat
          the S&P 500? 'Cause they're
          sheep -- and the sheep get
          slaughtered. I been in the business
          since '69. Most of these high paid
          MBAs from Harvard never make it.
          You need a system, discipline, good
          people, no deal junkies, no
          toreadores, the deal flow burns
          most people out by 35.
          Give me PSHs -- poor, smart and
          hungry. And no feelings. You don't
          win 'em all, you don't love 'em
          all, you keep on fighting, and if
          you need a friend, get a dog, it's
          trench warfare out there sport...
               (eyeing the surroundings)
          and in here too. I got twenty other
          brokers out there, analyzing Charts.
          I don't need another one. Talk to
          you sometime...

     He turns to go, Bud panicking. Is this the kissoff?

                    BUD
               (with all his conviction)
          I'm not just another broker Mr.
          Gekko. If you give me another
          chance, I'll prove it to you. I'll
          go the extra yard for you. One more
          chance. Please...

     Gekko looks back, a beat, walks over to Bud, thrusts his
     towel hard at his stomach.

                    GEKKO
          You want one more chance? Then stop
          sending me information and start
          getting me some. Get dressed, I'll
          show you my charts.

     INT. GEKKO LIMOUSINE - PARK AVENUE - DAY/TWILIGHT

     Cruising up Park Avenue. A panel slides open next to the bar
     with a portable computer on it. A television is turned on to
     the evening news, a low hum of voices. Gekko punches into
     the keyboard of the computer. A name appears an the screen...
     LAWRENCE WILDMAN with curriculum vitae following; address,
     phones, businesses...

                    GEKKO
          Know the name?

                    BUD
          'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the
          first raiders.

                    GEKKO
               (amused, cold hatred)
          Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits
          he thinks he was born with a better
          pot to piss in... bribed an old
          secretary of mine to open bar mouth
          and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right
          out from under me. Wildman the
          white knight.

                    BUD
               (excited)
          I remember that deal. You were
          involved?

     Gekko shuts off the computer and slides it back into the
     housing, his eyes taking in the low-volume news.

                    GEKKO
          Revenge is a dish best served
          cold... well, it's payback time,
          sport.
               (looking out suddenly)
          ... see that building? I bought
          into it ten years ago. It was my
          first real estate deal. I sold it a
          couple of years later and made an
          $800,000 dollar profit. It was
          better than sex. At that time I
          thought that was all tne money in
          the world...
               (drinks)
          Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a
          mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me
          half the picture, then he got fired...

                    BUD
          I don't understand.

                    GEKKO
          Wildman's in town. He just became
          an American citizen. Something
          big's about to go down. I want to
          know where he goes and who he sees.
          I want you, sport, to give me the
          missing half of the picture...

                    BUD
          Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...
               (shaken)
          It's not what I do. I could lose my
          license. If the SEC found out, I
          could go to jail. It's inside
          information, isn't it?

                    GEKKO
               (scratches his head wryly)
          Inside information. Oh you mean
          like when a father tells his son
          about a court ruling on an airline?
          Or someone overhears me saying I'm
          gonna buy Teldar Paper? Or the
          chairman of the board of XYZ
          suddenly knows it's time to blow
          out XYZ. You mean that?
               (a piercing look)
          I'm afraid sport, unless you got a
          father on the board of directors of
          another company, you and I are
          gonna have a hard time doing any
          business...

     Bud downs the rest of his drink, upset by the darkening mood.
     There's something very powerful and frighteninq about Gekko.

                    BUD
          What about hard work?

                    GEKKO
          What about it? You work hard. I'll
          bet you stayed up all night
          analyzing that dog you bought. And
          where'd it get you?... my father
          worked hard too like an elephant
          pushing electrical supplies. And he
          dropped dead at 49 with a heart
          attack and a tax bill and the bank
          pissed on his grave and took the
          house; my mom ended up working in a
          dish factory... Wake up pal, if
          you're not inside you're outside.
          And I'm not talking a $200,000 a
          year working Wall Street stiff
          flying first class and being
          "comfortable", I'm talking rich
          pal, rich enough to fly in your own
          jet, rich enough not to waste time,
          50-100 million, a player Bud -- or
          nothing. You had what it takes to
          let through my door. Next question:
          You got what it takes to stay...??

     The car stopping in traffic. Horns honking.

                    GEKKO
               (pointing)
          Look out there...

     THEIR POV -- a STREET CORNER. A richly dressed EXECUTIVE
     stands at the curb next to the BUM with a shopping cart
     filled with garbage.

                    GEKKO (O.S.)
          You really think the difference
          'tween this guy and that guy is
          luck? Mohammed, pull over.

     The car pulls over. Gekko checks his watch, pulls out the
     telephone.

                    GEKKO
          ...when it comes to money, sport,
          everybody's of the same religion.
          Or should be... Hope you don't mind
          if I let you off here, I'm late for
          a meeting. Good bye, nice knowing you.

     EXT. PARK AVENUE - TWLIGHT

     The CHAUFFEUR lets Bud out the door... Bud looks back at Gekko.

                    BUD
          All right, Mr. Gekko...you got me.

     His eyes telling us he is weighed down by chains of guilt.

     Gekko smiles, gazes at the twilight skyline, a sudden look
     of contentment.

                    GEKKO
          Yeah, it's a beautiful night. I
          love this hot stinkin' city.
               (pointing up Park Avenue)
          ... nothing else like it in the
          world. Seven million people living
          on each other's heads, kids born,
          millionaires dying, people praying,
          junkies, whores, wills, lawyers,
          deals, parties, sex... guys like
          you sport -- dreaming about the big
          score. You know the best thing
          about New York is everything you
          can do here. And the worst thing is
          everything you can't do here...

     He shuts the door. Bud watches as the limo drives off.

     EXT. FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY

     Bud, in a suit, waits next to a motorcycle across from one
     of the most desirable addresses in New York.

     The Doorman rushes to open the door under the canopy as a
     tall strong man in his fifties emerges with a LAWYER TYPE
     and a FEMALE EXECUTIVE. The man is SIR LAWRENCE WILDMAN and
     his manner and gait convey the impression of an authoritative
     presence with little patience as the chauffeur opens the
     door and he slides into the back seat of the limo.

     Buddy, astride Marv's Kawasaki 500, hits the streets after
     him. The music through the following Montage should suggest
     a chase brio.

     EXT. WALL STREET BUILIDING - DAY

     Bud shooting past the Trinity Church structure... Wildman
     gets out of his limo with his people, strides into the lobby.

     Bud quickly parks his bike on the sidewalk and rushes in
     after them... not a second too late.

     INT. LOBBY - WALL STREET BUILDING - DAY

     Bud just manages squeeze in the elevator with Wildman and
     crew -- and -- a couple of other early birds -- as the doors
     close.

     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

     Bud eyeing Wildman, looks away as Wildman looks back at him,
     an edge of defiance to him, why are you staring at me? Not
     the world's most likeable personality.

     INT. KAHN, SEIDELMAN - OUTER OFFICE - DAY

     The doors open and Wildman and Co. step out into the
     reception area of Kahn, Seidelman... The doors close and
     Buddy continues upward.

     EXT. WALL STREET BUILDING - LATER MORNING

     The street now jammed with people hurrying to work. Buddy
     paces the curb, reacting when Wildman walks out, saying
     goodbye to the female executive and getting in the limo with
     his lawyer... Buddy follows.

     INT. LE CIRQUE RESTAURANT - PARK AVENUE - DAY

     Formal French haute cuisine. Power lunches in progress. As
     Wildman is seated with several well-dressed BANKERS at a
     good table, Bud tries to wrangle a table (next to Mr.
     Wildman on top of everything from a stiff looking Maitre d'
     who shakes his head, barely concealing his attitude towards
     Buddy's youth and general demeanor.

     EXT. LE CIRQUE - DAY

     Buddy waits outside, bored, as Wildman steps out, shakes
     hands with the bankers... Bud making an entry into his
     notebook like any good spy.

     EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL QUEENS - DAY

     Music rising to triumphant proportions. AERIAL SHOT of Limo
     emerging from the tunnel and onto the Long Island Expressway.
     CAMERA MOVES IN, picking up Buddy on the Kawasaki, darting
     through lanes, staying several car lengths behind.

     EXT. LAGUARDIA AIRPORT - DAY

     The Limo winds its way along the perimeter road, past
     commercial airliners. It takes the turnoff for Butler
     Aviation. Buddy exits the ramp shortly after them.

     EXT. BUTLER AVIATION AIRFIELD - DAY

     A corporate saberliner jet, its engines running, idles at
     the end of the taxiway. The limo pulls up along the tarmac
     next to it and Wildman steps out, walking past a MECHANIC to
     the stairs of the plane. A STEWARDESS waits for him.

     EXT. RAMP - DAY

     Bud watches, wondering what to do as the plane taxies down
     the runway. He spots the flight mechanic and the answer
     comes to him. He starts running towards the mechanic.

     EXT. APRON - DAY

     Bud races up to the mechanic.

                    BUD
          Oh shit, don't tell me Mr. Wildman
          was on board that plane?
               (the mechanic nods)
          My boss is gonna kill me. I was
          supposed to give him this.
               (holding his notebook)
          You know where that plane is going?

                    MECHANIC
               (walking off)
          Erie, Pennsylvania...

     INT. PHONE BOOTH - AIRLINES TERMINAL - DAY

                    BUD
               (into phone, proudly)
          ...after spending the morning at
          Kahn, Seidelman -- on the 14th
          floor, the junk bond department --
          where Shane Mora works -- he had
          lunch at La Cirque with a group of
          well-dressed heavyset bean-
          counters...
               (Gekko voice back:
               "the adjectives are
               redundant, sport")
          ...he later stopped off at Morgan.
          I'd say from all the palm-pressing
          and sweet smiling going on that
          Larry got some nice fat financing...
          G.G.

     INT. GEKKO LIMOUSINE - HEADING DOWN PARK AVENUE - DAY

     Alex and Susan are with him. Gekko playing the computer,
     eyes lighting up on the phone.

                    GEKKO
          ...bright but not bright enough,
          Sherlock, roll the dice and play a
          little monopoly... what box would
          Sir Lawrence land on in Erie,
          Pennsylvania?

     INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

     Bud slapping his face, realizing.

                    BUD
          Jesus Christ, he's buying Anacott
          Steel!

     INT. GEKKO LIMO - DAY

     Gordon already has the closing figures punched up on his
     quotron. Calls his shot.

                    GEKKO
          When the market opens tomorrow, buy
          five thousand March fifty calls.
          You hear me? Start buying ten
          thousand share blocks and take it
          up to fifty dollars. When it
          reaches fifty, you can let out a
          little taste to your friends.
          Then call this number -- 555-7617:
          tell the man "blue horseshoe loves
          Anacott Steel..." You scored, Buddy!
          Be in touch.
               (hangs up)


     He hangs up, looks at Alex and Susan.

                    GEKKO
          Start buying Anacott Steel all over
          the board.

     INT. BLUESTAR MAINTENANCE HANGAR - SAME DAY

     A large company banner hangs from the rafters: "Bluestar -
     The Vision Goes On." Buddy's father, Carl, Charley Dent and
     Dominick Amato are changing the generator on a 727. A welder
     is repairing a wing seam. Buddy shouting to his Dad over the
     noise.

                    BUD
          Hey Dad!... Hi ya Charlie...
          Dominick...

     They wave back, Carl climbing down a maintenance stand...
     lights up a cigarette.

                    CARL
          What brings you out here...

                    BUD
          Client. Got a private jet over at
          Butler Aviation... Dad, you always
          gotta light up when you see me,
          it's the...

                    CARL
               (don't bother me look)
          Don't start, alright.

                    BUD
          Alright. Why so pissed?

                    CARL
          Goddamn fare wars are murdering us.
          Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I
          could do. What is it... money?

     Bud takes out his wallet, smiles, peels out 10 $100 bills.

                    BUD
          Yeah, it is. In fact I'm doing
          great. New client. Whole new league.
          It's starting to happen Dad. The
          Big Leagues! You know what I'm saying.

     He sticks the cash in his hand.

                    CARL
               (doesn't)
          Sure...lots of guys at the track
          talk like that... but how do you
          know you'll have any dough next
          month...
               (looking at the money)
          What's this? I gave you two hundred.

                    BUD
          Dividend. I figure I owe you about
          five thousand in nickels and dimes...

                    CARL
               (tries to give it back)
          ...don't be crazy. Put it to your
          school loans.

                    BUD
          Don't worry about the loans. I'm
          doing good Dad and it's gonna stay
          that way now... least buy yourself
          a new suit.

                    CARL
          What do I need a fancy suit for. I
          don't hobnob with the jet set. I
          just fix their planes.

     Buddy forces the money into his hand.

                    BUD
          ...then buy yourself a decent
          bowling jacket so when you take Mom
          out you don't look like the Roto
          Rooter man. Come on, for godsakes,
          that's what money's for. Enjoy
          yourself...

     Touched, his father shakes his head and smiles. He takes it.

                    CARL
          Problem with money is you never
          have enough or you got too much --
          and when you got it you're never
          happy 'cause somebody's always
          trying to take it away from you.
          Money's one giant pain in the ass
          y'ask me... thanks.

                    BUD
               (admiration)
          ... Dad, you should've been a CEO.
          How about dinner?

                    CARL
          Whatever night you like.

                    BUD
               (remembering)
          Wait... next week's booked. Let me
          check with my girl and get back to
          you on Monday.

                    CARL
               (laughs at his new lifestyle)
          Yeah, you do that huckleberry. I'll
          still be here.

                    BUD
          ...gotta run Dad. You stop smoking,
          you hear?

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bud silent, an intent look on his face, gazing up at the
     digital clock... as it flicks to 9:30... post time.

     Tickers, squawk boxes and shouting erupt.

     Bud calls in his order: "10,000 AN STL 46... and let me know
     how the options are opening."

     Music skips along in a revolving madcap fashion.

     INT. FLOOR OF AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

     A CLERK hands the buy order to the FLOOR MANAGER. He starts
     writing a ticket as we pull back:

     INT. AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

     Company floor traders are jammed into a narrow booth,
     frantically takinq orders over phones and telex machines.

     The FLOOR MANAGER gives the ticket to a RUNNER, a young man
     wearing worn sneakers, who dashes off. We follow him across
     the scruffy Exchange Floor, as he weaves through a crush of
     traders crammed around horseshoe-shaped kiosks, cathode-ray
     tubes slung above them, displaying the latest prices in
     bright, green letters and numbers. Intermittent shrieks and
     howls, calls to buy and sell, issue from the far reaches of
     the labyrinthian room.

     As in the final leg of a relay race, the RUNNER hands the
     ticket off to a COMPANY TRADER, who is buying and selling at
     the post where Anacott Steel is traded. The TRADER checks
     the ticket and turns to the SPECIALIST, executing the order.

     The camera moves up as the Anacott Steel (AN STL) quote
     flashes across the broad tape -- as the price ticks up from
     46 to 46 1/4.

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bud paces nervously at his desk, looking at his quotron. AN
     STL appears on the screen, now up to 47. Bud puts in another
     order.

     INT. STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR - DAY

     The SAME RUNNER races over, handing Bud's next TICKET to the
     COMPANY TRADER.

     Tilt up to the broad tape.

     As ANACOTT STEEL, AN STL, rises to 48 1/8.

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     On Bud, eating a sandwich, eyes glued to the ticker. AN STL
     has climbed to 48 3/4. Marv stalks by, shouting on the phone.
     Bud looks away from the ticker, pretending to read a report.
     When Marv disappears, Bud hastily calls in at 49.

     INT. STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR - DAY

     On the tired RUNNER dodging through the crowd, and over to
     the TRADER handing him a new ticket.

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Close on the OFFICE TICKER -- as Anacott Steel hits 50.

     Buddy jumps up from his chair, and animatedly crosses to
     Marv who is on the phone, cold calling.

                    MARV
          Tell Mr. Ehrlich I've got important
          financial news! It concerns his
          future.

     Bud presses down on the phone button, cutting him off.

                    MARV
          What the hell...

                    BUD
          Anacott Steel. Buy it.

     Marv looks at Joe and sees a look on his face that he's
     never seen before.

                    MARV
               (nervous)
          Anacott Steel -- right.

     Bud leaves, Marv re-dials.

                    MARV
          Dr. Beltzer, you're gonna love this!

     Lou Mannheim hangs up the phone, a troubled look. Bud leans
     into his office.

                    BUD
          Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.
               (whispering)
          Anacott Steel.

                    MANNHEIM
               (scoffs)
          No such thing Bud - 'cept death and
          taxes. Not a good company anymore,
          no fundamentals. What's going on
          Bud? Do you know something?
               (Bud uncomfortable,
               Lou reads it)
          Remember there're no short cuts
          son, quick buck artists come and go
          with every bull market but the
          steady players make it through the
          bear markets.
               (Bud anxious to go)
          You're part of something here, Bud.
          The money you make for people
          creates science and research jobs.
          Don't sell that out.

                    BUD
          You're right, Mr. Mannheim, but you
          gotta get to the big time first,
          then you can be a pillar and do
          good things.

                    MANNHEIM
          Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.

                    BUD
          It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust
          me -- buy.

     Charlie Cushing's on the phone.

          You mean teach you how to play.
          Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada,

               (winks)
          ...light snack, but good, thanks
          pal, you're sharking your way up...

     Dan Steeples's talking confidentially on the phone.

                    STEEPLES
          I've just heard the most lovely two
          words... 'Anacott Steel.'

     Buddy dialing the phone number that Gekko gave him. He
     speaks into the receiver, in a hushed voice.

                    BUD
          ...Blue horseshoe loves Anacott
          Steel.
               (hangs up)


     INT. WALL STREET JOURNAL OFFICE - DAY

     The REPORTER on the other end of the phone hangs up. He
     rises from his desk, strides across the busy news floor,
     over to an ASSOCIATE.

                    REPORTER
          Anacott Steel's in play. Check the
          arbs.

     EXT. GEKKO BEACH HOUSE - BRIDGEHAMPTON - TWILIGHT

     Wind and waves. Gekko's modern, Sante Fe structure house
     sits on a dune overlooking the grey Atlantic.

                    GEKKO (V.O.)
          Sweeten the offer, throw 2 bucks
          more in a convertible preferred.
          And 5 year contracts for themselves.

     INT. GEKKO LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Immense slanted ceilings, a vast clean modern space filled
     with dozens of contemporary art objects, junk sculptures,
     floor to ceiling windows radiating light, that look out on a
     cantilevered deck and pool - and the ocean beyond.

                    GEKKO (CONT'D)
               (on the phone)
          ... Cromwell wants to play
          financial chicken with me, we'll
          see who swerves first. Where the
          hell's Gene?

     Gekko slumps down on a sofa, exhausted, watching one of
     several news reports he master-controls with a remote.

                    SUSAN
               (on phone)
          You sent him to Vermont to get the
          deposition from the CEO Cromwell
          fired.

                    GEKKO
          ...done and done. Night gang, and
          Susan no legs waving in the air
          tonight. I want you dreaming about
          Teldar Paper.

     During this, RUDY, Gordon's 3 year-old son, drives in in the
     latest electronic baby toy -- a Porsche-bodied electric car.
     Gekko hangs up, checks out a Reuters quotron positioned nearby.

                    GEKKO
          Rudy Kazootee, how's my cutie!

     The kid jumps out of the car and scoots into his father's lap.

                    RUDY
          Daddy bad boy! Bad boy! -- play
          with Wudi... Now!

                    GEKKO
          No, not now Rudy. Daddy's making
          money to buy you toys. Daddy work.

                    RUDY
          Daddy work bad boy!

     Gordon absently tossles Rudy's hair, his eyes glued to the
     TV. The kid senses it, jumps back off his lap and into the car.

                    BUSINESS ANALYST
          ...the big story tonight is Anacott
          Steel which closed at 51 1/8.  Up 5
          1/8 from yesterday's close on heavy
          trading...

     Kate, Gordon's beautiful, raven-haired wife, homemaker and
     antiquer, enters with the bovine-eyed AU PAIR GIRL from
     France... just at Rudy drives his car into a wall where it
     stalls, engines grinding.

                    KATE
          I think somebody's playing hooky
          from the bathtub. Rudy, say good
          night DAddy...

                    GEKKO
               (can't hear, to Kate)
          Shut that off, willya!

     Kate, upset with the noise, tries to pull her son nicely out
     of the car.

     The Korean HOUSEBOY coming in.

                    HOUSEBOY
          Calls for you, sir, a reporter from
          Time magazine on two, says it's
          important... and a Mr. Fox on three.
      
               GEKKO
               (annoyed)
          I come to the country and it's
          worse than the city! I'm not home...
               (changes mind, pushes in)
          Yeah?

                    BUD
               (off)
          Mr. Gekko, I've been trying to
          reach you. We got the options. We
          got a good execution on them!

     Meanwhile, the kid has no intention of going anywhere and
     plants his feet and emits the loudest shrieking this side of
     the fat lady in the opera.

                    GEKKO
          Nicole! Take him will you...

     Handing the bawling, writhing mass of anger to Nicole as if
     it were laundry she doesn't want to touch... Nicole takes
     him screaming out of the room... Gordon trying to concentrate
     on the TV.

                              INTERCUT TO:

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Papers and charts are strewn around, trailing down to a box
     of take-out pizza and empty beer bottles. Bud has stayed late.

                    BUD
               (almost apologetic,
               speeding on the high
               of the buy...)
          I got all I could get which was
          750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50
          calls. Average price of $47 a share
          And $4 per contract for the call. I
          just wish I could've got more.

                    GEKKO
          Don't expect to get it all, sport,
          you'll burn out. First rule of
          business is never get emotional
          about stock, clouds the judgment.
          Where do we stand?
      
               BUSINESS ANALYST
          In response to an inquiry from the
          New York Stock Exchange, management
          issued a terse no comment. Wildman
          would not return phone calls.
          Analysts believe the company is
          worth $75 per share in a transaction.

                    KATE
          John and Carmen are here and the
          Livingstons are on their way...

                    GEKKO
               (nods, listening to phone)
          I'll be right there, fix them a drink.

                    BUD
               (shifting the figures)
          ...we have 37.2 million invested.
          At this point, we're up 3.1 million
          and some change. If it goes to 75
          bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.

                    GEKKO
               (smiles)
          You're walking between the
          raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry
          is choking on his royal chamber pot
          by now.

                    BUD
          My firm needs your signature on
          these option agreements tonight,
          sir, otherwise we could take a real
          bath tomorrow.

                    GEKKO
               (sighs)
          ...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.
               (Bud waits, "Sir")
          ...Awright. Come out, get the
          directions from Natalie and hurry up.

     EXT. GEKKO'S BEACH HOUSE - BRIDGEHAMPTON - NIGHT

     Bud's P.O.V. as he pulls up to an austere, ultra-
     sophisticated monolith of glass and wood dominating a
     stretch of dune overlooking the Atlantic's angry surf.
     Several Jags, state of the art Jeeps and a Rolls are drawn
     up outside.

     Bud, getting out of his faded Honda, goes up the stairs to
     the door. He rings several times.

     A BLACK BUTLER opens it and looks at Buddy somewhat warily.
     Laughter and voices are heard from inside.

                    BUTLER
               (pretentiously: high
               English accent)
          Can I help you?

                    BUD
          Bud Fox. Got some papers for Mr.
          Gekko to sign.

                    BUTLER
          Wait a moment please.

     Without thinking he closes the door in Joe's face. He stands
     there, harrassed peering around through a window on the lawn.
     A small gathering of friends in progress around a glowing
     fireplace. The butler waves him in from the door.

     INT. GEKKO ALCOVE - NIGHT

     Bud enters, as Gekko approaches.  He seems annoyed to be
     disturbed at his country home.

                    BUD
               (apologetic)
          Sorry, Mr. Gekko.

                    GEKKO
               (takes the papers)
          Allright. Wait here...

     About to go when his wife, Kate Gekko, comes over. A pretty
     dark-haired woman.

                    KATE
          Problems?

                    GEKKO
          No... Bud Fox, my wife, Kate...

     They exchange pleasantries.

                    KATE
          You came from the city?
               (with a look to Gordon)
          Long drive, have a drink.

     Gekko doesn't seem to like the idea, but...

                    GEKKO
          Yeah, why not, Bud boy...
      
Kate's walking back inside to her guests, as Bud sidles over
     to Gekko.

                    BUD
          ...if you'd rather not, Mr. Gekko,
          I can leave...

     INT. GEKKO LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     They cross to the main living room.

                    GEKKO
          ...It's okay Buddy, you know Alex...
          Candice Rogers.
               (Alex and his date
               shake hands, faintly aloof)
          ...This is Stone Livingston... and
          his wife Muffie.
               (a young stuffy
               banker in weekend
               corduroys looks at
               Bud as if he
               obviously doesn't belong)
          ...Darien Taylor, Sam Ruspoli,
          Carmen Winters, Dick Brady... All
          old friends.

     Bud looking wide-eyed at the beautiful "Calvados" BLONDE
     he's been dreaming of for weeks... she's with Mr. GQ and
     doesn't recognize Bud, nods back, they all nod back,
     naturally suspicious of the young outsider... Rudy's TOY
     ROBOT wheels  around the floor with a drink on its tray,
     talking computer talk...

                    STONE LIVINGSTON
               (charmed by it)
          ...good idea Gordon, good help is
          hard to find these days but can he
          whip up a dry vodka martini...

                    GEKKO
          ...well he doesn't talk back or
          steal the silver and Dick's gonna
          get me an exemption on him, aren't
          you...
               (Dick Brady is
               obviously an accountant)


     Bud plucks a glass of wine from the robot's tray and plunks
     himself down on a sofa, overhearing the conversation between
     Muffie Livingston and Candice Rogers.

                    MUFFIE
          ...there I am in St. Kitt's in my
          new Kamali leopard skin V-cut
          bikini which is going to turn back
          the clock on our marriage five
          years, you know what I mean, and I
          can't even fit into it, my skin's
          all pink and inflamed, and I look
          like a walking social disease all
          because this Ukranian bitch botched
          the wax on my bikini line.

                    CANDICE
               (revolted)
          Oh my god, how ghastly, you should
          sue her...

     The Korean houseboy has come over to Gekko.

                    HOUSEBOY
          Call for you sir. Sir Larry
          Wildman, he says it's important...

     Bud tightens, so does the whole room hearing the name of the
     moment. Gekko smiles at Buddy.

                    GEKKO
               (to houseboy)
          Make Mr. Livingston a martini would
          you Nyung, and this gentleman...
               (to Bud)
          Stick around, this could be fun...

     He goes to the alcove to take the call.

                    MUFFIE
          So, I had to sit around the beach
          wearing a moo-moo for 10 days, my
          whole vacation ruined.
               (noticing as Bud
               laughs, chokes on the
               wine, spilling some
               on the couch)
          You just spilled your wine.

     Bud noticing the stain, starts wiping it.

                    CANDICE
          You're just making it worse.

     INT. GEKKO ALCOVE - NIGHT (RAIN)

                    GEKKO
               (on phone)
          Larry, what a surprise...
               (beat)
          Can it wait till tomorrow. I got
          some people over.
               (dryly)
          ...if you feel that way Larry, come
          over.

     INT. GEKKO LIVINGROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)

     The blonde, DARIEN TAYLOR, is examining a modern sculpture
     as Buddy comes over with two Calvados.

                    BUD
          Hello again, I been holding these
          drinks for us for the last three
          weeks.

                    DARIEN
               (uncomprehending)
          Excuse me.

                    BUD
          Grand Marnier. A romantic and
          tragic drink.

                    DARIEN
          Oh yes, I remember you.

                    BUD
          Destiny took us apart, but I knew
          it would bring us back together.

                    DARIEN
          Aha. Poet or philosopher?

                    BUD
          Stock broker. As in: never have so
          few done so little for so much. So
          what do you see in this?

     Bud indicates the painting in front of them -- a buffalo
     skull in the desert by Georgia O'Keefe.

                    DARIEN
          I'd give anything to have this in
          my house, even for a week.

                    BUD
          ...few thousand dollars down the
          drain if you ask me.

                    DARIEN
          Oh really?
               (looks at him quizically)
          Well, I guess you can kiss that
          career as an art appraiser goodbye,
          because we paid over four hundred
          thousand for it at the contemporary
          picture sale last June.

                    BUD
               (chokes)
          You could have a great beach house
          for that.

                    DARIEN
          Sure you could, in Wildwood, New
          Jersey. If you sold this,
               (indicates a Rothko
               hanging near the O'Keefe)
          you could have a pretty nice
          penthouse on Fifth. But you
          wouldn't have much left over for
          decoration.

                    BUD
          Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough
          businessman, but somebody's really
          taking him to the cleaners here.

                    DARIEN
          Not really. I'd say that Gordon is
          one of the most astute collectors
          around. He has a great eye and he
          only buys the best. Like this rug
          for instance, a silk Tabriz, the
          finest of its kind. The day after
          he bought it in London, a dealer
          representing the Saudi Royal Family
          offered him twice what he paid. It
          absolutely makes the room. See how
          this little bit of celadon in the
          border is picked up in the cushions
          oh the sofa... although...
               (she's really warming
               up to her subject now)
          I don't know if I would have used
          that tea dipped linen for the
          upholstery - too dingy.
          And it's a sacrilege having that
          Pre-Columbian pot in the center of
          the coffee table. Some dope might
          use it as an ashtray.

                    BUD
          I gather you're a decorator.

                    DARIEN
          You got it, a great spender of
          other people's money.

                    BUD
          Well, if you're that good, you
          could probably do wonders at my place.

                    DARIEN
          Where is it?

                    BUD
          Upper West Side.

                    DARIEN
               (losing interest fast)
          Oh really. Home of the exposed
          brick wall and the
               (shudders)
          houseplant.

                    BUD
          Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving
          to the East Side soon. I've got a
          couple of deals brewing with Gordon.
               (shifts uncomfortably
               with his pretension)
          but that's just conversation...
          what about real things? Like dinner.
          The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo
          Domingo.

     Bud waits, staring suddenly and deeply into her eyes.

                    DARIEN
          What if I have a previous engagement?

                    BUD
          Break it.

                    DARIEN
          I guess this must be destiny
          alright. My first yuppie apartment
          and...
               (pats him on the
               cheek flirtatiously)
          my first yuppie.

                    BUD
               (gives her a steely glare)
          You may call me a yuppie... It's
          Mister Yuppie to you.

     They both laugh.

                    BUD
               (gets serious)
          So. See you Friday.

                    DARIEN
          You really do believe in destiny?

                    BUD
          Only if I want something bad enough.

     Her date, Mr. GQ, SAMMY RUSPOLI intersects with Kate. A
     cultivated European air.

                    SAM
          ...there you go again, Darien,
          talking with strange men.

                    KATE
          That's our Darien: elusive,
          reclusive, exclusive.
               (to Sam)
          You know Bud right? He works for
          Gordon...
               (Sam nodding, makes
               conversation, big smile)
          Sam's in banking. You staying for
          dinner Bud?

                    BUD
               (hesitant, eyes Darien)
          No, I'm afraid I've got to get some
          work...

     Kate noticing the doorbell ringing.

                    KATE
          ...excuse me.

     Sam muttering something in Darien's ear of an intimate
     nature. She glides away with him.

                    DARIEN
               (to Bud)
          Call me next week, I'll give you an
          estimate...

     An ironic promise in her eyes... Bud ecstatic inside...
     looks over, goes to the foyer...

     INT. GEKKO ALCOVE - NIGHT (RAIN)

     SIR LARRY WILDMAN walks in, his country gentleman clothing
     somewhat softening his imposing figure but not the cultured
     rapacious eagle's face. With him a lawyer.

                    KATE
               (strained)
          Larry, how have you been? Get you a
          drink?

                    WILDMAN
               (slightly impatient)
          Oh fine. Travelling actually.
          Nothing thank you. Is...

                    KATE
          Gordon?... He's right here.

     As Gordon intersects, casually tasting a spot of the dinner.

                    GEKKO
          Larry! Excuse me "sir" Larry, great
          to see you again, you're looking
          good.
               (handshakes)


                    WILDMAN
          Gordon...
               (sniffing the guests
               and furnishings in
               the room as if they
               were stale air)


                    BUD
               (leaving, to Gordon)
          I guess I'll head back...
      
               GEKKO
               (spontaneously)
          Stick around... Larry, one of my
          "gang" -- Bud Fox.

     Pleasantries. Bud nervously shakes hands, sensing Wildman
     might recognize him from being tailed in the elevator. There
     indeed is a moment but Wildman's attention blurs as...

                    GEKKO
          Shall we go upstairs?

     INT. GEKKO DEN - NIGHT (RAIN)

     Gordon enters a den lined with old books hunting prints;  he
     proudly picks up something from his gun collection.

                    GEKKO
          Rarest pistol in the world, Larry,
          a .45 Luger. Only six were ever
          manufactured.

                    WILDMAN
          Congratulations but rarer still is
          your interest in Anacott Steel.

                    GEKKO
          The same interest as yours Larry.
          Money. I thought it'd be a good
          investment for my kid...

                    WILDMAN
          No. This time I'm in for the long
          term. This is not a liquidation,
          Gordon. I'm going to turn it around.
          You're getting a free ride on my
          tail, mate, and with the dollars
          you're costing me to buy back the
          stock, I could modernize the plant.
          I'm not the only one who pays here
          Gordon. We're talking about lives
          and jobs; three and four generations
          of steel workers...

     A strong hint of the cockney working class east and London
     boy whiffing through his speech and manner. The "mate" is
     tough and to the point but not insulting...

                    GEKKO
               (has to smile)
          You must be wearing a mask you're
          laughing so hard behind it Larry.
          Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct
          me if I'm wrong, but when you took
          CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000
          workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000,
          that airline...

                    WILDMAN
               (cold, deliberate)
          I could break you, mate, in two
          pieces over my knees, you know it,
          I know it, I could buy you six
          times ever, I could dump the stock
          just to burn your ass but I happen
          to want the company and I want your
          block of shares. I'm announcing a
          tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and
          I'm expecting your commitment.

     Bud watching this drama unfold. Gekko is about to blow,
     controls it.

                    GEKKO
          Showdowns bore me Larry, neither
          side wins. You can have the
          company, in fact it's gonna be fun
          watching you and your giant ego try
          to make a horserace out of it...
               (turns to Bud)
          What do you think is a fair price
          for our stock Bud?

     Bud in the spotlight. The eyes all shift to him -- his
     moment. After an initial panic, he's cool as a cucumber --
     and ruthless as his mentor.

                    BUD
          The break up value is higher. It's
          worth 80.

                    GEKKO
          But we don't want to be greedy now,
          so let's let him have it at $72.

     His eyes to Wildman who looks at him, cold, icy mean.

                    WILDMAN
          You're a two bit pirate and a
          green-mailer, Gekko, nothing more...
          not only would you sell your mother
          to make a deal, you'd send her COD...

     Bud looking sharply as Gekko's eyes flare with hot white anger.

                    GEKKO
          My mail's the same color as yours
          Larry. Or it was till the Queen
          started calling you "sir". Now
          excuse me before I lose my temper...

     He rises and exits.

                    WILDMAN
          $71...

     Gekko stops at the door, a beat.

                    GEKKO
          Considering you brought my mother
          into it, $71.50.

                    WILDMAN
          Done. You'll hear from my lawyers.
          8 a.m. Good night.

     He walks out with the silent lawyer. Past Gekko who watches.
     "Ta Ta".

                    GEKKO
               (to Bud)
          He's right. I had to sell. The key
          to the game is your capital
          reserves. You don't have enough,
          you can't pee in the tall weeds
          with the big dogs.

                    BUD
               (mimicking Gordon now)
          "All warfare is based on
          deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your
          enemy is superior, evade him, if
          angry, irritate him, if equally
          matched, fight... if not, split and
          reevaluate.

                    GEKKO
          You're learning, sport...

     INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

     Exhausted from the drive back, Bud takes off his sweater and
     tie and collapses onto the bed, closing his eyes. The phone
     rings. With a start he wakes and answers it.

                    BUD
          Yeah?...

                              INTERCUT TO:

     EXT. GEKKO'S BEACH HOUSE - DAWN

     The sky is still dark, the first rays of light coming up
     over the ocean. Gekko, a lonely figure in a windbreaker,
     restlessly prowls the edge of the beach, waves crashing
     around him. He's been up all night and has an exhausted,
     driven look as he whispers over the wind into the cellular
     phone...

                    GEKKO
          Money never sleeps pal. When I came
          in in '69, they traded six hours a
          day, now the clock don't stop,
          London's deregulated, the Orient is
          hungrier than us. Just let the
          money circle the world, sport,
          buying and selling, and if you're
          smart it comes back paying. I just
          made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold.
          It's been wired to you -- play with
          it. You done good, but you gotta
          keep doing good. I showed you how
          the game works, now school's out.

                    BUD
               (protests)
          Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%.

                    GEKKO
          You don't understand. I want to be
          surprised...astonish me, sport, new
          info, don't care where or how you
          get it, just get it... My wife
          tells me you put a move on Darien.
          Here's some inside info for you.
          That Euroflash GQ guy she's going
          with's got big bucks but he's
          putting her feet to sleep. Exit
          visas are imminent. So don't lose
          your place in line.
               (gazing at the surf)
          Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this.
          The lights coming up over the water.
          I've never seen a painting that
          captures the beauty of the ocean at
          this moment.
               (suddenly fatigued)
          ...an old Russian proverb - "a
          fisherman always sees another
          fisherman from afar." I like you
          sport, I ever tell you that...
          Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.

                    BUD
               (off)
          ...Gordon.

                    GEKKO
          Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud
          Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough
          you can afford a girl like Darien.
          Remember, power is the best
          aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up
          call. Go to work.

     He lets the phone drop to his side, staring glazed-eyed at
     the ocean.

     INT. ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

     A SECRETARY leads Bud into the plush, private office of a
     cocky young lawyer, ROGER BARNES, about tho same age as Bud,
     his his feet up on the desk, sleepily waving to Buddy to
     park his ass... The pictures an his walls and desk indicate
     a rich family.

                    ROGER
          Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has
          it really been a year. You're not
          hitting me up for NYU are you?

                    BUD
          Well we're thinking of putting up a
          statue of you in the subway. I hear
          you're moving up in the world. An
          associate already. Not bad. How's
          Margie?

                    ROGER
          Can't complain. Got a house in
          Oyster Bay. Market treating you
          good? Still seeing that sexy French
          gal?

                    BUD
          Nah, she asked the wrong question.

                    ROGER
          What was that?

                    BUD
          "What are you thinking?"...that was
          it. The hours are hell, but the
          money's starting to tumble in. I
          know this guy who's got an iron-
          clad way to make money, I can't
          lose and I can't get hurt.

                    ROGER
               (interested)
          So, does "this guy" have a tip for
          an honest lawyer?

                    BUD
          Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's
          still not over.

                    ROGER
          Okay.

                    BUD
          What about you, I hear you guys are
          handling the Fairchild Foods merger
          and it may not be going through.
          Any surprises I haven't read about
          in the Wall Street Journal?

                    ROGER
               (casually)
          Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to
          got me disbarred now would you?

                    BUD
               (equally casual,
               looks at the walls)
          Who's listening? It's just one
          college buddy talking to another.

                    ROGER
               (sarcastic)
          Yeah, right...

                    BUD
          Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it
          but you don't know, you don't know.

                    ROGER
          ...and if I did, what's in it for moi?

     He obviously has thought about it before. Bud smiles back,
     nonchalant.

                    BUD
          More money than you ever dreamed,
          Roger. And the thing is no one gets
          hurt...how bout a beer?

                    ROGER
               (some doubt)
          Too much to do...but I'll walk you
          out.

     INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - EVENING

     They walk out past the CLEANING CREWS coming in for the
     evening, drones of the vacuum cleaners...

     Bud looks - his POV... A CLEANING WOMAN as she pulls the
     vacuum cleaner into one of the senior partners offices, the
     desk crammed with proposals, Bud is lost in thought.

                    ROGER
               (teasing)
          ...Get inside my uncle's door
          Buddy, all the secrets of the world
          are yours... the life blood of
          companies, but you gotta go to law
          school first...

     EXT. BARNES' OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

     Bud comes out of the building and starts walking away. As he
     passes the freight entrance, Bud abruptly notices a van
     marked MARSALA MAINTENENCE COMPANY. He looks back, thinks
     for a moment: a look in his eyes.

     EXT. LONG ISLAND CITY - LIGHT INDUSTRIAL PARK - DAY

     Bud walks past a row of small warehouses and enters one.

     INT. MARSALA MAINTENANCE OFFICE AND GARAGE SERVICE - DAY

     He steps into a shabby reception area. A chain-smoking OLD
     LADY looks up from the switch-board.

                    BUD
          I need to speak to the owner about
          some business.

     INT. BACK OFFICE - DAY

     The owner, a GREEK with bushy mustache and hardened face,
     sits at his desk eating lunch, eyeing Bud suspiciously.

                    BUD
               (handing him a card)
          Mr. Panos, I've charted the growth
          of new office space in the city,
          and I think you're in the right
          business at the right time.

                    PANOS
          Thank you for telling me what I
          already know.

                    BUD
          I'm impressed with your work and I
          could use a tax break. This is a
          growing business. Are you interested
          in some working capital and a partner?

     Panos puts down his sandwich, measuring Bud.

                    PANOS
          What makes you think I need a
          partner?!

     Bud smiles, ready with his spiel.

     An elevator opens. A body steps out. A set of keys. Boom up
     past a clipboard and pen to a shirt pocket with MARSALA
     MAINTENANCE written on it, up to Bud dressed in janitorial
     clothing.

     We move with him to the CREW SUPERVISOR who introduces THREE
     CLEANING WOMEN who nervously absorb Bud, worried for their
     jobs.

     Bud strolls from office to office, looking official,
     overseeing his crew, making notations on a checklist.

     Bud slips into the Senior Partners' office, thumbs through a
     calendar on the desk. Sees the list of people, moves to the
     computer, punches the client's name in. The code number
     comes up.

     Bud nods to a SECURITY GUARD down the hall and enters the
     file room where he looks at the Cleaning Lady and points to
     his watch. As she exits, he scrambles nervously through the
     files -- finds the code number -- then anxiously flips the
     pages to the critical tender offer document -- with the
     target name -- INVESTMENT IN RORKER ELECTRONICS CORP. It's
     stamped "DRAFT" across the page. His face lights up. The
     secret to the kingdom. He puts it back, exits.

                              WIPE TO:

     INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

     Gekko on the phone, smiling.

     INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

     Bud, obviously exhausted from his day and night roles, is
     telling him something on the phone.

     INT. SECOND LAW FIRM - NIGHT

     Bud furtively xeroxes a document on a small hand-carried
     copy machine in his pocket or photographs it if it is too
     large.

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     Bud and Alex, Gekko's assistant, having lunch. Alex gives
     him the briefcase he's carrying. Pan from Alex to Bud back
     to discover Darien in the next scene.

     INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

     Bud dines with Darien, small talk, intimate looks.

     INT. THIRD LAW FIRM - NIGHT

     Bud is in an office, eyes panning the shelves.

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Can I help you?

     Bud's head jerks around. A young female PARALEGAL is burning
     the midnight oil. She looks at him from behind a stack of
     briefs.

                    BUD
               (backing off)
          Uh. Wrong office. Sorry...

     EXT. BRIDGEHAMPTON BEACH - DAY

     Gekko, Kate, Bud, Darien and A FIFTH PERSON roar over the
     dunes, each in their own dune buggy, laughing and hollering
     at one another...

     Buddy driving right up precariously close on Darien, who
     screams... Buddy flips over his vehicle... comes up
     laughing... we sense he is getting wilder now...

     EXT. HORSE FARM - BRIDGEHAMPTON - DAY

     Darien rides expertly. A beautiful, immaculately-groomed
     stallion is being shown to Gekko by the trainer.

     Bud is sipping wine as he looks on with Kate.

                    GEKKO
               (proudly)
          Got him at an auction in Kentucky.

                    BUD
          How much?

                    GEKKO
               (fondling the head)
          Close to two million.
               (Bud whistles)
          But this sucker can go all the way
          to Devon and the nationals.

     Darien rides in, smiling to Bud.

                    BUD
          Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew.
          What about the Triple Crown?

                    DARIEN
          He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a
          jumper.

                    BUD
          How would I know? I once bet a
          horse. He went out at ten to one
          and came in at quarter to five.

     He laughs, a little sloppy.

     EXT. OCEAN - DAY

     Darien swims in the ocean, long looping athletic strokes.

     EXT. POOL AND PATIO - GEKKO'S BRIDGEHAMPTON HOUSE - DAY

     They're finishing lunch by the pool framed by a lush flower
     garden where Kate and son Rudy play. HAROLD SALT, Gekko's
     chief lawyer, thick glasses, smart eyes and bags of worry
     that could only come from watching other people's money,
     looks very city-like in his clothing, examining his
     paperwork before passing it to Bud, who is the picture of
     relaxation.

                    HAROLD
          ...You understand Mr. Gekko is
          constantly barraged with nuisance
          litigation and IRS audits.

                    BUD
               (nods)
          Of course.

                    HAROLD
          ...So it's in both our interests to
          put a safe distance between you and
          us...
               (passing a document
               with a 2nd pen)
          ...this gives you limited power of
          attorney for Mr. Gekko's account.
          Every trade you make is at your
          discretion. Every ticket you buy
          must be marked "power of attorney."
          That means you call the shots and
          Mr. Gekko has no official knowledge
          of what stocks you're buying. Sign
          here and here...

     Buddy looks, then up to Gekko, who smiles, casual.

                    GEKKO
          ...just the beginning, sport, just
          the begining...

     Bud smiles, signs.

                    HAROLD
               (a worrier)
          ...you understand if any problems
          arise, you're out there on your own.
          The trail stops with you...

                    BUD
          All's fair in love and war.

                    GEKKO
          The art of which is deception.
          Spread the buy orders through
          different accounts and you won't
          get burned...

                    BUD
          I think I got some friends that
          won't mind making some easy money...

     As Kate drifts over with Rudy and the French au pair GIRL,
     NICOLE.

                    GEKKO
          Rudy, viens ici, dit bonjour a
          Monsieur Bud.

     Rudy either says "No!" or "Bonjour Monsieur Bud!' depending
     on the mood of the kid. Gordon sweeping him up and playing
     with him. The kid squeals with glee.

                    GEKKO
               (proudly)
          Already speaks a little French, kid
          got the highest score on his IQ test.

                    KATE
               (to Darien)
          ...it's so tough to get into a good
          nursery school now. They even visit
          your home to make sure your
          paintings and furnishings are
          acceptable.

                    BUD
          What's it cost these days?

                    KATE
          $5,000 just for the tuition... plus
          the books and supplies...
               (with a look to Gordon)
          ...some parents even have bodyguards.
          It's not a bad idea...
               (picking up Rudy)
          ...now that's it for you with the
          grown-ups young man.

     As Rudy smashes the strawberries around his face and resists
     going. "No! No!" Kate exasperated gives the child to Nicole.

                    KATE
          Nicole, take him for a nap, please.

                    NICOLE
          He doesn't nap anymore, Madame.
          It's been...

                    KATE
               (stung)
          Then play with him till he gets
          tired. We're going out tonight but
          we like to see him at, let's see,
          six; give him a bath and put that
          cute little black suit on him...
               (to Bud and Gordon)
          Black clothes are the newest
          things, so chic and milk stains,
          carrot juice stains just don't show
          up. Kids -- boy, can they take it
          out of you!

     Nicole's "Oui, Madame" is lost in the wrestling match she
     goes through to drag him out screaming. Kate walking off.
     Harold gives Buddy another piece of paper...

                    HAROLD
          This is a contact at one of our
          banks. On settlement day you'll
          open an account there for Mr. Gekko
          under the name of Geneva, Roth
          Holding Corp. Then you'll wire
          transfer the money to this account
          in the Cayman Islands...

                    GEKKO
               (rising, finished
               with lunch)
          Think about incorporating yourself
          there, Bud, Harold will take care
          of it for you.
               (with a look to Harold)
          ... at a reasonable fee. You're
          gonna make a lot of money now Bud...
          stakes are gonna go up, no mistakes...

                    BUD
          ...piece of cake, Gordon...

     EXT. BEACHFRONT - DAY

     The camera glides off some FISHERMEN hauling their catch off
     their beached boat to Darien who comes tromping out of the
     surf, water glistening off her lean athletic body. Bud
     stands before her, cool seductive eyes, holding out a towel.
     She steps up to him and smiles inscrutably. Takes the towel
     from him, drying herself, instead.

                    DARIEN
               (gazing at the beach)
          If I could have anything... this
          would almost do.

                    BUD
          Yeah, almost...

     Looks at her, stifles his thought.

                    DARIEN
               (teasing)
          So, how did your conference go with
          Gordon?

                    BUD
          The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We
          reached an agreement and decided to
          divide up the world between us.

                    DARIEN
               (laughs)
          You have modest wants. I like that
          in a man.

                    BUD
          And what do you want?

                    DARIEN
          ...a Turner, a perfect canary
          diaiaond... a Lear jet... world
          peace... the best of everything...

                    BUD
          Well, why stop at that?

                    DARIEN
          I don't.

                    BUD
               (has to smile)
          You're not trouble by any chance.
          Are you?

     She looks at him, tosses the towel over her shoulder and
     starts back toward the house. Buddy watches her go.

     INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

     The annual Teldar Paper stockholders' meeting is in session:
     400 stockholders are there -- many middle aged and older,
     one bag lady. Cromwell sits on an elevated platform at the
     front of the room surrounded by an army of bulky EXECUTIVES,
     none of them weighing less than 200 pounds, ACCOUNTANTS and
     LAWYERS. Gekko in contrast seems like Robin Hood seated with
     Alex, Harold, Bud and the other stockholders. Cromwell is
     delivering his prepared attack on Gekko in a highly
     sarcastic, gruff manner.

                    CROMWELL
          ...Your company, ladies and
          gentlemen, is under siege from
          Gordon Gekko.
          Teldar Paper is now leveraged to
          the hilt, like some piss poor South
          American country...instead of using
          our cash to build plants, build our
          business, all this man really wants
          is to get paid to withdraw his
          tender offer and that will cost us
          approximately another $200 million
          in greenmail which will be passed
          on to the consumer...

     Gekko seething, jumps up.

                    GEKKO
          Where do you get off speaking about
          me like that, making remarks to the
          press, I resent these remarks, I
          demand the right to speak.

                    CROMWELL
          Sit down, sir, you're out of order,
          haven't you done enough damage to
          Teldar as it is?...have you no
          sense of decency?
               (to shareholders)
          How can your management...

     Gekko is urged to sit down by his people but we hear various
     catcalls, "Let the man speak!" "Sit down, Gekko!"

                    CROMWELL (CONT'D)
          ...concentrate on long term growth
          when we're busy fighting the get-
          rich-quick, short term profit, slot
          machine mentality of Wall Street
          when we should be fighting Japan!
          The original fundamental reason for
          Wall Street was to capitalize
          American business, underwrite new
          business, build companies, build
          America. The "deal" has now
          succeeded goods and services as
          America's gross national product
          and in the process, we are
          undermining our foundation. This
          cancer is called "greed". Greed and
          speculation have replaced long-term
          investment. Corporations are being
          taken apart like erector sets,
          without any consideration of the
          public good. I strongly recommend
          you to see through Mr. Gekko's
          shameless intention here to
          strip this company and severely
          penalize the stockholders. I
          strongly recommend you to reject
          his tender by voting for
          management's restructuring of the
          stock.

                              CUT TO:

     Gekko is now at floor level with a microphone. He's calmer,
     makes his pitch to the stockholders, looking up at the
     management.

                    GEKKO
          ...I appreciate the chance you're
          giving me, Mr. Cromwell, as the
          single largest stockholder in
          Teldar, to speak.
               (gets some laughter
               and applause, loosens)
          On the way here today I saw a
          bumper sticker. It said, "Life is a
          bitch... then you die".
               (gets another laugh)
          ...well ladies and gentlemen, we're
          not here to indulge in fantasies,
          but in political and economic
          reality. America has become a
          second rate power. Our trade
          deficit and fiscal deficit are at
          nightmare proportions. In the days
          of the 'free market' when our
          country was a top industrial power,
          there was accountability to the
          shareholders. The Carnegies, the
          Mellons, the man who built this
          industrial empire, made sure of it
          because it was their money at stake.
          Today management has no stake in
          the company. Altogether these guys
          sitting up there own a total of
          less than 3% and where does Mr.
          Cromwell put his million dollar
          salary? Certainly not in Teldar
          stock, he owns less than 1%.
          You own Teldar Paper, the
          stockholders, and you are being
          royally screwed over by these
          bureaucrats with their steak
          lunches, golf and hunting trips,
          corporate jets, and golden
          parachutes! Teldar Paper has 33
          different vice presidents each
          earning over $200,000 a year. I
          spent two months analyzing what
          these guys did and I still can't
          figure it out.
               (a big laugh)


     Cromwell is pissed.

                    CROMWELL
          This is an outrage Gekko! You're
          full of shit!

                    GEKKO
          One thing I do know is this paper
          company lost $110 million last
          year, and I'd bet half of that is
          in the paperwork going back and
          forth between all the vice
          presidents...
               (increased laughter,
               he's getting them)
          The new law of evolution in
          corporate America seems to be
          'survival of the unfittest'. Well
          in my book, you either do it right
          or you get eliminated. Teldar Paper
          is doomed to fail. Its
          diversification into casualty
          insurance has not worked. Its crown
          jewels are its trees, the rest is
          dross. Through wars, depressions,
          inflations and deterioration of
          paper money, trees have always kept
          their value, but Teldar is chopping
          them all down. Forests are
          perishable, forest rights are as
          important as human rights to this
          planet, and all the illusory
          Maginot lines, scorched earth
          tactics, proxy fights, poison
          pills, etc. that Mr.
          Cromwell is going to come up with
          to prevent people like me from
          buying Teldar Paper are doomed to
          fail because the bottom line,
          ladies and gentlemen, as you very
          well know, is the only way to stay
          strong is to create value, that's
          why you buy stock, to have it go up.
          If there's any other reason, I've
          never hear it.
               (laughter)
          That's all I'm saying...it's you
          people who own this company, not
          them, they work for you and they've
          done a lousy job of it. Get rid of
          them fast, before you all get sick
          and die. I may be an opportunist,
          but if these clowns did a better
          job, I'd be out of work. In the
          last seven deals I've been in,
          there were 2.3 million stockholders
          that actually made a pretax profit
          of $12 billion. When I bought the
          Ixtlan Corporation it was in the
          exact same position Teldar is
          today -- I turned three of its
          companies private and I sold four
          others -- and each of these
          companies, liberated from the
          suffering conglomerate has
          prospered. I am not a destroyer of
          companies, I am a liberator of them.
          The point is, ladies and gentlemen,
          greed is good. Greed works, greed
          is right. Greed clarifies, cuts
          through, and captures the essence
          of the evolutionary spirit. Greed
          in all its forms, greed for life,
          money, love, knowledge, has marked
          the upward surge of mankind -- and
          greed, mark my words -- will save
          not only Teldar Paper but that
          other malfunctioning corporation
          called the USA...Thank you.

     Much applause as he sits. Now a standing ovation; shouts of
     approval. Cromwell knows he has lost the day, tries to
     continue the meeting by calling for "order".

     Bud watches, impressed.

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     BROKERS mill at their desks quietly. Bud enters, notices
     immediately the uneasy silence. His eyes go to Lynch's
     office... across the windows, he's talking to a very somber
     Dan Steeples.

                    BUD
          What's going on?

                    MARV
               (looking in the same direction)
          Lynch is giving him the boot...
          He's not pulling his quota.

     Bud's soft "no" matched by that second, tighter look. His
     POV -- closer on the glass... Dan Steeples pleading for his
     job... we know the things he's saying, we've heard them
     before... just one more chance, Mr. Lynch... Lynch shaking
     his head...

                    MARV
               (reminding him)
          ...we're all just one trade away
          from humility, Buddy...

     Dan Steeples steps out of the office, obviously close to
     tears but trying to maintain face... Buddy's eyes dart away,
     not wanting to deal with it. Dan Steeples walks by his as
     Lynch, on the loudspeaker, starts his morning announcements.

                    LYNCH
          New research report on GM and a
          conference call on defense stocks
          at my office at 11. No RSVP
          required, just be there. And on an
          inspiring note I'm pleased to
          announce the new office record for
          a single month's gross commission
          goes to Bud Fox. Who more than
          doubled the old mark. Way to go Bud.
          Super job! Come on up here.

     As Dan Rickey passes him during this, Bud catches a glimpse
     of the older man's eyes. Dan tries to look brave. Heads
     turning to Bud with awe and envy...

                    MARV
          Congrats buddy buddy, you just made
          my life twice as hard around here...

     Bud moving toward Lynch, past Lou Mannheim.

                    MANNHEIM
          You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it
          while it lasts -- 'cause it never
          does.

                    BUD
               (cocky)
          ...just kickin' ass and taking
          names, Mr. Mannheim.

     Bud passes Charlie Cushing, yawning on the phone as usual.

                    CHARLIE
          So whaddaya say pal, wanna play
          some doubles at Piping? Meet the
          membership? I got a little blonde
          named Mandy, about nineteen, avec
          cafe au lait boobs... she's mine
          but she's got a cousin who has
          great muffins.

                    BUD
          ...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping
          Rock any day.

     Chuck laughs, Bud's "in" now. Lynch indicates for Bud to
     follow him into an outer glass-enclosed office.

                    LYNCH
          Come in, Bud...

     INT. BUD'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

     Neatly furnished, with a window overlooking Wall Street, and
     attractive CHINESE SECRETARY filing papers into a cabinet.

                    LYNCH
               (points)
          Congratulations. This is yours
          now... your own file cabinets... a
          window ... your private secretary,
          Janet,
               (under his breath)
          significantly more attractive.

                    JANET
          Nice to meet you, Mr. Fox.

     She smiles at Bud, who heaves a sigh of relief, noticing his
     name plate on the desk.

                    BUD
               (thrilled)
          Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr.
          Lynch.

                    LYNCH
          No, thank you. I knew the minute I
          laid eyes on you, you had what it
          takes Bud. Just keep it going.

     He winks and leaves. Charlie Cushing comes in, Marv sticks
     his head in the doorway, a grudging smile.

                    MARV
          So, its Mister Fox now.

     INT. CONDOMINIUM APARTMENT - UPPER EAST SIDE - DAY

     A splendid four-room thirtieth floor aerie overlooking
     Central Park. SYLVIE DRIMMER, anchored down with jewelry and
     a large fur purse, shows Bud around.

                    SYLVIE
          ...everybody tells ya they hate the
          Upper East Side and they wanna live
          on the West Side but honey when it
          comes to resale time, believe me
          the East Side's the one that always
          moves. What do you get on the West
          Side?
               (contemptuously)
          Madonna and Sean?... between Sly
          and Billy and Christie, I've shown
          every apartment on the Upper East
          Side. Everybody lives here... Mick,
          Gloria and Barbara Wa-Wa. Even
          Klaus von Bulow buys his fresh
          fruit from the Korean on Madison.
          It's so expensive and it's just
          like the ones on Eighth Avenue but
          it's an attitude is all, you pay
          for attitude
               (pointing to a walk-
               in closet)
          ...two walk-in closets...upstairs
          on the roof you lot a health
          club...massage, sauna, jacuzzi,
          sunlights, best schools in the
          city, cute boy like you gotta think
          of a ladyfriend when you're
          finished wolfing around --
               ('course I'm taken)
          ...oak strip floor...my husband can
          get you a 10% mortgage...I'd do it
          myself if we weren't into four
          other deals already...so?...
               (beat)
          I got a four o'clock and a
          five...one of them's an all-cash
          type, Monique something or
          other...I guarantee you this place
          is history tomorrow...

     Bud looks around. The city at his feet. Lost in thought.
     Sylvie has to call him out of it: "honey? -- The meter's
     running. Anybody home?"

                    BUD
          All right. Offer 950...

     Sylvie tries to play it cool, her expression conveying a
     somewhat stunned look at the speed and certainty of the
     response.

                    SYLVIE
          ...I think you gotta deal, honey...
          you sure you don't wanna see
          somethin' I got on Sutton Place.
          It's a million and a half but...

                    BUD
          Nah...this is it..home...

     Looking it over, proud.

     INTERIOR DECORATING MONTAGE

     The music is geared to speed, money, triumph and just plain
     material fun.

     INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY/NIGHT

     In its first stage, Darien supervising. It's expanse of
     white walls devoid of mouldings, a blank plaster canvas. The
     city views are great, the apartment identical to hundreds of
     other cookie cutter condos. Several young artists are
     working on a neo-classical mural on the long side of the
     living room. They are colorfully dressed, listening to a
     TALKING HEADS tape while they work. A carpenter who looks
     like a member of Duran Duran is installing a pair of old
     columns from Urban Archaeology on either side of the
     entrance to the living room while another fits a brass sink
     into an antique sideboard which has been turned into a bar.

     INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY/NIGHT

     INTERIOR DECORATING MONTAGE - SECOND STAGE

     Living room furniture arrives. A fantail shrimp chaise from
     Art Furniture's "Sushi Collection" arrives, along with an
     enormous sofa encased in an ecru linen slipcover made
     deliberately baggy and tied on with rows of self bows on
     each end, several faux Etruscan pots wired up as lamps, a
     poured concrete coffee table that looks like it came from
     Pompeii, and a hand-painted floor cloth instead of a rug for
     the bleached floor with the stencilled border... Darien
     sitting in a fantastical adirondack chair made from gnarled
     branches, amused by Bud's reactions to the furniture.

     THIRD STAGE. The kitchen has the latest compact computer
     dishwasher and compact microwave, garbage compactor, and
     sinks with infrared controls... A brief food montage gives
     us a sense of the modernist approach to food and its
     preparation:

     1) Darien hones the knives on the electric knife sharpener as

     2) Bud uses a stainless steel Cape Cod oyster opener to work
     on two dozen oysters...

     3) at the same time working on the automatic vinaigrette
     mixer, the phone ringing to the tune of Mozart's "Jupiter"...

                    BUD
               (picking it up)
          Yes...no...at 37 1/2. Convert the
          bonds right...and check the price
          in Tokyo at 8:00 LA time. Thanks...

     4) As he starts his pasta sauce flame an his O'Reilly fat-
     free grill with a flexible neck fire starter...

     5) A freshly heated roll pops out of a hanging space-saving
     toaster, as Darien works the electric pasta maker while
     melting the frozen ice cream cartons in the microwave.

     6) Bud manages to sneak a kiss an her lips humming the bars
     from Verdi's "Rigoletto" as he works the piece de la
     resistance--the automatic sushi maker...

     7) Dinner is finally served on a demolished dinner table.
     Red wine, pasta, sushi...it looks perfect, lit by
     candlelight, the view of the city below.

                    DARIEN
          ...isn't it perfect!

                    BUD
          ...too perfect...let's not even eat.
          Let's just watch it and think about
          it.
               (pause)

     FOURTH STAGE - INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

     Bud goes over a stack of bills with something approaching
     concern as the gothic oak refectory table which seats 20 is
     carried in, followed by a Jean Michel Basquiat featuring a
     skull on a rough board. Darien instructs the movers to place
     an important pair of satinwood Art Deco armchairs upholstered
     in buttery suede (last Saturday's auction purchase for
     $20,000) at either end of the titanic sofa. No vestige is
     left of the cookie cutter space we first saw. Walls have
     been removed, mouldings and architectural found objects
     added, imitation rare woods, marbles and frescos have been
     created from nothing by the magic hands of the tromp l'oeil
     crew. The point is, decorating can transform.

     INT. CONDO - NIGHT

     The look of the place is evocative of ancient times, yet
     sumptuous. Darien and Bud sink into the bales of down in the
     sofa and are dwarfed. She rests her head on a hand stencilled
     velvet Venetian throw pillow, looking like a Pre-Raphaelite
     madonna. A terracotta pot with a spray of white phaleonopsis
     graces the coffee table. As the sun sets over the canyons of
     highrises, Bud walks around his new home totally in awe.
     This apartment, perfect in its restrained taste with all the
     "correct" flowers and objects, has nothing to do with him.
     Perhaps he can understand the state-of-the-art kitchen, the
     computerized telephone, stereo and light system, but he
     needs a set of instructions just to be able to switch on
     David Letterman.

     This apartment is Darien's fantasy, and Bud is merely the
     incidental client who paid for it. Most importantly to her,
     it is ready to be photographed by House and Garden.

                    BUD
               (dubiously looking at
               a rough plaster wall
               of fading fresco)
          You know, the elevator man couldn't
          believe I paid $300,000 to have my
          walls looking like this, he's got
          them for free in Brooklyn.

                    DARIEN
          I'll bet he's got an opinion on the
          stock market too. This apartment is
          already ahead of its time. I call
          it the "demolished" look. They've
          already heard about it at House and
          Garden and they're coming next week
          to photograph it before it gets...
          lived in. Is that alright? I'd love
          to have it in my portfolio.

                    BUD
          Sure... But your fee... considering
          you're way over budget, should be
          negotiable.

     As he nuzzles her neck, she feels threatened, stops.

                    DARIEN
          Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm
          not going to take a cut. I worked
          hard and you can't decorate a room
          in New York for less than $100,000.
          Curtains alone...

                    BUD
          I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're
          still young, Darien. So what's
          money anyway when everybody's
          making it, it's all relative. After
          all, this is not the house in
          Connecticut, this is just a crash
          pad good for a couple of
          years...before we slip our two
          lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie
          into the Lycee Francaise.

                    DARIEN
          You got it all charted out don't
          you, like a stock projection.
      
               BUD
          That's right -- one with high
          yield, rich assets and no downside...

     As the kiss grows, his hands move into her nether regions.
     She looks at him, sober.

                    DARIEN
          Do you think you're ready?

                    BUD
          It's not me I'm worried about...You
          know Darien, the only reason we
          haven't slept together is because
          we both know we will -- and not
          knowing when was the only surprise
          left. You owe me, I want you, what
          else is there...but you, me, the
          world.
               (he folds back her
               palms in his)
          ...right here...make love to
          me...now...
               (more kissing)
          Stop me if I'm going too far.

                    DARIEN
          I'll let you know.

     INT. BUD'S CONDO - BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Bud making love to Darien. Camara closing on them.

     Her face -- from his point of view. Her smile.

     His face -- looking down. Covered with sweat and passion.

                    BUD
          Is this real? Is this really real?

     EXT. BUD'S CONDO - TERRACE - NIGHT

     Bud walks out alone in his blue bathrobe on his parapet
     overlooking Central Park. The wind stirs his hair. The East
     and West sides of the park wrap the city in a diamond
     necklace of brilliant light.

     Bud stares down at the world. He has it all now. The money.
     The girl. The magic palace apartment. What more is there?
     Something...because Bud suddenly throws a wrenching
     dislocated look into himself that makes us wonder as he
     brushes his hand across his face and mutters to himself.

                    BUD
          Who am I?

     There is no ready answer. As he finally turns and goes back
     inside and closes the door.

     INT. BUD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Darien lies curled in the bed, eyes open, looking at him.

                    DARIEN
          Come to bed, Bud...

     EXT. PHONE BOOTH - SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - TWILIGHT

     Cocktail hour in the background, yuppies trying to score for
     the weekend. Bud on the phone, strained look transforming to
     a bright, upbeat personality as the phone is answered.

                    BUD
          Dixon! It's your lucky day! That's
          right. I want to give you some
          stock and you don't have to put up
          a penny...

                              INTERCUT:

     EXT. CABIN - ASPEN COLORADO - DAY

     A small cabin in the mountains.

     INT. CABIN - ASPEN COLORADO - DAY

     Whole earth furnishings. DIXON, a long-haired ski bum
     dropout listens skeptically.

                    DIXON
          Sure, and I'm never gonna die
          either, is this one of your chain
          letter schemes or do I gotta buy a
          door to door cosmetic franchise in
          Northern Arkansas?

     EXT. PHONE BOOTH - SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - TWILIGHT

                    BUD
          No, no Dixon, my client wants to
          buy a large, large block of stock
          and needs to spread it around. I'll
          park some money in your account and
          if it hits, you get a big cut. I'm
          telling you, this is the easiest
          money you ever made...

     INT. ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - DAY

     Roger listens on the phone.

                    BUD
               (off)
          ...and you don't have to put up a
          dime, Roger.

                    ROGER
               (tentatively)
          All right, Bud... let's do it.

     A look on his face. As if he knows he's making a fatal mistake.

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

                    BUD
               (on the phone)
          ...it's easy Jack! On settlement
          day, you endorse a check to Blue
          Horseshoe Trading Company. Then I
          send you your cut.

     Marv waves across the glass partition and knocks. But Bud
     waves him off, closing the blinds.

                    BUD (CONT'D)
          ...that's the bottom line. And
          nobody gets hurt.

     Marv now walks it, exasperated.

                    MARV
          ...things are so bad, even the
          liars are complaining. And you're
          making money. So what gives? What's
          the bottom line?

     As he tries to peak at Bud's quotron screen, but Bud flicks
     it off, pissed.

                    BUD
          Hey, I'm tired of playing nurse to
          you all the time, alright. Do your
          own home work!

     Marvin abruptly walks out, "asshole!". Bud books the order
     for Morning Star Corp -- MSC -- 50,000 June options.

     INT. AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - LATER THAT DAY

     The COMPANY FLOOR MANAGER gets Bud's order, hands a ticket
     to a RUNNER who dashes off across the exchange floor, and
     over to a TRADER who starts to execute the order.

     CLOSE on the broad tape. As Bud's large buy order flickers
     across it -- MSC -- 50,000 June options.

     INT. AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE - S.E.C. OPTIONS WATCH OFFICE -
     DAY

     A CLERK sits before a computer routinely tracking all of the
     exchange floor trading. He runs a check on a transaction.

     Computer Screen -- The same numbers and letters are seen
     that just flickered across the broad tape... Bud's buy.

     The clerk swivels his chair to a second computer and punches
     up data. A MAN appears behind him, leaning over his
     shoulder, and wears an ID BADGE. The clerk vacates his seat
     to the man with the badge, who now takes over.

     INT. BUD'S CONDO - NIGHT

     Bud is in silk boxers on the phone, number crunching on the
     computer, foot pounding to a music beat on the stereo, while
     his telex spews out overnight currency data.

     Darien in the background lies in bed in panties reading Vogue.

                    BUD
               (into the phone)
          Buy me 20 June Euro Dollar CDs.
          Twenty March gold and sell 10
          September Deutsch marks. That's
          right...

     He hangs up, back to the computer a growing look of
     excitement and revelation in his eyes.

     On the computer screen we see a break up Of Bluestar
     Airlines -- its assets and liabilities.

     Bud hits the command key, printing it out. He's exuberant.

                    BUD
          Bud, I hate to tell you this but
          you're a genius!
               (to Darien)
          Darien...lightning has struck! The
          lightbulb has been invented.
          Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are
          watching...

                    DARIEN
               (grumpy)
          ...are you going to trade all night
          again? You got to go to work in a
          couple of hours.

                    BUD
          You think I'm gonna broker the rest
          of my life... I'm going to be a
          giant, Darien, an entrepreneur in
          the Italian 15th century sense of
          the word -- a mover, shaker.

     Bud dances over to the bed turning the stereo down on his way.

                    BUD
          I love you, baby. Did I tell you
          that sometime in the last 24 hours?

                    DARIEN
          Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the
          sixty hour work week? You're
          turning into a yuppie Frankenstein,
          you love money so much.

     Bud grabs a bottle of Ferrier off the night table and drinks.

                    BUD
          Sure, why not, money's the sex of
          the 80's. I never had it like you
          when I was growing up, baby, it
          wasn't the upper east side.

                    DARIEN
          You're so naive Bud, you don't even
          know. Your dad took care of you. I
          might've been rich when I was a
          kid...but my father lost all his
          money...in the seventies, in the
          stock market, at the track. He was
          a lousy gambler...

                    BUD
               (teasing)
          ...that changes all my plans, I
          thought you were loaded...

                    DARIEN
               (laughs woefully)
          So did I, till I hit 19 and found I
          had all the royal habits and no
          throne. Mom got by but I had to go
          to work just like you.
          Only the skills I had were shopping
          and making friends. So...that's why
          I do what I do, what makes you
          tick, Buddy?

                    BUD
          Fear. The fear of being poor I
          guess, just like you, Darien... But
          that's all gonna change sweetheart.
          I'm catching the express...
               (making love to her)
          ... and you're going along for the
          ride.

     INT. GEKKO'S PRIVATE PLANE (GULFSTREAM - 4) - DAY

     A salon interior. Gekko on a couch reading, with eyeglasses,
     a stack of financial reports. Alex is on the phone, Susan,
     and others accompanying the caravan on a business trip. Bud
     is excited.

                    BUD
          ...Bluestar's an unpolished gem,
          Gordon, right out of the garbage. A
          half assed management being
          decimated by a price war they can't
          win. But the gates at LaGuardia
          alone can bail us out, it's worth
          25 bucks a share if it's worth a
          dime! They're ripe to fall.

     Gekko, the poker player, hasn't seen enough cards.

                    GEKKO
          Mixed emotions, Buddy: like Larry
          Wildman going off a cliff in my new
          Maserati. Men as smart as myself
          have got their asses handed to them
          on a sling with the airlines, fuel
          could go up, unions are killers...

                    BUD
          Yeah aren't you forgetting
          something Gordon: rule one, capital
          reserves. This company has $75
          million cash in an overfunded
          pension. That buys us a lot of
          credibility...
               (Gordon looks up, interested)
          ...and the beauty is you already
          own close to two percent of this
          sucker...

                    ALEX
               (interrupting, on the phone)
          Gordon, the insurance people are
          balking on the logging trucks...

                    GEKKO
          Tell those spineless toads we'll
          self-insure if they don't write
          it... You fire 33 vice presidents
          and nothing changes...
               (back to Bud)
          You eating twinkies today, Bud, or
          are you schtupping some stewardess...

                    BUD
               (deadly serious)
          Gordon what I want--and I never
          asked you for anything--is to be
          your co-pilot on this. I want to
          take this airline, turn it around,
          and make it work. It's gonna make
          us a fortune!

                    GEKKO
               (to Susan)
          I'm talking to a stockbroker who
          wants to run an airline. It's gonna
          take me two years and 2000
          headaches to turn Teldar Paper
          around, what do I need this dink
          airline for? I'm up to my ass in
          more nuts than a fruitcake.

                    BUD
          Gordon, I worked at Bluestar, I
          know my way around, I have friends
          there...inside.

                    GEKKO
               (getting the drift)
          What does that mean?

                    BUD
               (playing out his ace)
          The three unions. It's 43% of
          Bluestar's operating budget, the
          hourly cost of a flight crew is
          $850 an hour, that's the real
          hidden value G.G., if you can
          negotiate that out, get a crew down
          to $350-400 an hour a run, this
          airline is gonna be the hottest
          thing since Texas Air...

                    GEKKO
          What makes you think you can?

                    BUD
          I can talk to these people Gordon,
          they trust me...and my father can
          be a big help in getting cuts.

                    GEKKO
               (pause)
          Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on
          the box. I want him to look at it.
          And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick,
          Jensen...
               (smiles wickedly,
               back to Bud)
          So sport, the falcon has heard the
          falconer...tell me more...

     INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Bud, in high gear, all smiles, expensive Armani suit, opens
     the door. His father stands before him, looking like a man
     on his way to the dentist.

                    BUD
          Dad, well come on in. Everybody's
          here. We couldn't start the show
          without you.

     Wide-eyed, Carl follows Bud through the foyer, taking in the
     furnishings, paintings, antiques.

                    CARL
               (under his breath)
          Well I'll be a lousy Republican.

                    DARIEN
               (overhears him)
          I decorate for Democrats too, lots
          of them.
               (she extends her hand
               and gives him a warm smile)
          I'm Darien Taylor.

                    CARL
               (sardonically)
          I know. You're one of the art works
          that go with the apartment.
               (softens a little)
          Pretty creative. Doesn't look
          anything like the place my son
          bought a few months age.

                    DARIEN
          Listen, I hope you'll come here
          often, and under less formal
          circumstances.

     Halfway won over Carl enters the living room where Darien
     has set up a table with miniature gourmet pizza, etc. The
     atmosphere is strained, the camps separated. Gekko stands by
     the bar, conferring with his lawyer, Harold Salt. Darien
     walks over to the couch with drinks for the Ixtax Union
     Reps: DUNCAN WILMORE, ALPA Leader, a rugged silver-haired
     uniformed pilot; TONI CARPENTER, AFA Rep, hard looking,
     40ish flight attendant.

                    BUD
          Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore,
          pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter,
          flight attendants...

                    CARL
          I met them before you were born.

     They exchange nods.

                    BUD
          And I'd like to introduce you to Mr.
          Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.

                    GEKKO
          A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.

     Carl stares at Gekko, sizing him up.

                    GEKKO
          I'd be proud to have a son like Bud.
          He's got a great future ahead of him.

     Carl looks to his fellow union representatives, then to Gekko.

                    CARL
               (gesturing at Salt)
          I thought this was an informal
          meeting. What's he doing here?

                    GEKKO
               (dismissing him)
          Harold, you don't mind strolling
          around the block a couple hundred
          times, do you?

                    HAROLD
               (looks at his watch)
          Of course...

     Salt gathers his jacket to leave, as Gekko and Carl eye one
     another, tentatively.

                    DARIEN
          ...please help yourselves to some
          food...

                              CUT TO:

     The food is half consumed. Gekko addresses the union leaders.

                    GEKKO
          Look, I have no illusions about
          winning a popularity contest with
          any of you. I was roasted the other
          night, and a friend of mine asked--
          why are we honoring this man--have
          we run out of human beings?

     His joke breaks the ice; they laugh, except for Carl.

                    GEKKO (CONT'D)
          It's not always the most popular
          guy who gets the job done. You got
          losses of 20 to 30 million dollars,
          dividends cut to zero, you're
          getting squeezed to death by the
          majors. Present management may not
          be the worst scum of the earth, but
          they're the ones who've put you on
          a kamikaze course, and pretty soon
          everybody's going to be scrambling
          for the parachutes. Only there
          aren't enough to go around.
          Management has them. You don't. If
          they throw Bluestar into Chapter
          11--which I think they will--then
          they can use bankruptcy laws to
          break your unions and your
          contracts and throw you guys off
          the property.

     We hear a loud crunching sound as Bud's father bites into a
     roll, glaring at Gekko.

                    WILMORE
               (pilot)
          With all due respect, Mr. Gekko,
          what's to prevent you from doing
          the same thing?

                    GEKKO
          Cause I have a way around all this,
          a way we can all make money and
          make this airline profitable again.
          What do you say we cut to the chase.
          I'm asking for a modest twenty
          percent across-the-board wage cut.

     Carl drops his fork on the plate. Gekko goes on.

                    GEKKO
          And seven more hours a month.

     Toni Carpenter and Duncan Wilmore exchange questionable looks.

                    CARPENTER
          What kind of time frame are we
          talking about here?

                    GEKKO
          Give me a year. If we're still
          losing money, the reductions stand.
          If however, we move into the black,
          I return part of the givebacks,
          salaries go back to present levels,
          and...
               (a beat)
          we institute an employee profit
          sharing program with stock. You'll
          own part of the airline.

     Carpenter and Wilmore react with surprise, it's obvious they
     weren't expecting the profit sharing part. Bud smiles at
     Darien and looks to his father, who examines a sushi roll
     before putting it back.

                    WILMORE
          Are you prepared to put that in
          writing?

                    GEKKO
          I'll have a letter of agreement
          drawn up within two days.

                    CARPENTER
          What's your marketing strategy? How
          do you plan to return us to
          profitability?

                    GEKKO
          Why don't I give Bud an opportunity
          to answer that.

     Darien and Carl turn to Bud, who puts down his wine glass.
      
               BUD
          Thank you Mr. Gekko. First of all I
          want you to know my door will
          always be open to you cause I know
          from my Dad it's you guys that keep
          Bluestar flying. One -- Modernize.
          Our computer software is weak, we
          update it, we squeeze every dollar
          out of each seat and mile flown.
          You don't sell a seat to a guy for
          $89 when he's willing to pay $389.
          Effective inventory management
          through computerization will
          increase our load factor by 5 to
          20%, that translates to
          approximately 50 to 200 million
          dollars in revenues; the point is,
          we can beat the majors at a price
          war. Two -- Advertising -- more,
          more, and aggressive, attack the
          majors. Three -- expand our hubs to
          Atlanta, North Carolina and Dallas,
          reorganize all our feeder schedules,
          think Big -- guys, we're going
          after the majors!

     The men are visibly shaken by Bud's determination.

                    GEKKO
               (looking for reactions)
          Cards are on the table. What do you
          think?

                    WILMORE
               (restrained, hopeful)
          If you mean what you say, I think
          we're in the ball park. I'll take
          it to my people.

                    CARPENTER
               (approvingly)
          You've sketched some broad strokes.
          I'd like to see the fine print. But
          so far so good.

     Gekko looks to Carl Fox who, putting down knife and fork,
     breaks his silence.

                    CARL
          I guess if a man lives long enough,
          he gets to see everything. And I
          mean everything. What else do you
          have in your bag of tricks, Mr. Gekko?

     Bud tenses, looking at his father. Gekko ignores the
     innuendo and replies softly.

                    GEKKO
          Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving
          much more. If you have any
          suggestions I'll be glad to listen.

                    CARL
          There came into Egypt a Pharoah who
          did not know.

                    GEKKO
               (smiling)
          I beg your pardon. Is that a proverb?

                    CARL
               (smiling)
          No, it's a prophecy. The rich have
          been doing it to the poor since the
          beginning of time. The only
          difference between the Pyramids and
          the Empire State Building is that
          the Egyptians didn't have unions.
               (looking at Wilmore
               and Carpenter)
          I know what this guy is about--
          greed--he's in and out for the buck
          and he don't take prisoners. He
          don't give a damn about Northstar
          or us ...

                    BUD
          Now, wait a minute, Dad...

                    GEKKO
               (shrugs, keeping his composure)
          Sure. What's worth doing is worth
          doing for money. It's a bad bargain
          where nobody gains. And if this
          deal goes through, we all gain.

     Carl throws down his napkin, rises from the chair, looks at
     the others.

                    CARL
               (looks at Bud)
          'Course my son did work three
          summers as a baggage handler and
          freight loader. With those
          qualifications, why should I doubt
          his ability to run an airline?

     There is frozen silence at the table.

                    GEKKO
          Fine, if you don't want us, stay
          with the scum in present
          management--dedicated to running
          you and Bluestar into the ground.

                    CARL
          ...that "scum" built this company
          up from one plane in thirty years,
          they made something out of nothing,
          and if that's a scum I'll take one
          over a rat any day...

     Carl turns and leaves. Bud glances at Gekko, reading his
     piercing look. He hurries after his father.

     INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Bud catches up to Carl, waiting for the elevator, hammering
     him.

                    BUD
               (seething)
          Congratulations. You did a great
          job of embarrassing me in there--
          not to mention yourself! Save the
          "workers of the world unite" speech
          for next time Dad, I heard it too
          much growing up. You're gonna get
          axed Dad, no two ways about it, you
          and the whole airline are going
          down the tubes, you hear me, just
          like Braniff, you don't have a
          chance in hell, and if it isn't
          Gekko it's gonna be some other killer.

     INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

     Carl steps into the elevator, Bud follows.

                    CARL
          He's got your prick in his back
          pocket, son, and you're standing
          naked in the display window of
          Macy's. He's using you. Only you're
          too blind to see it.

                    BUD
          No, what I see is a jealous old
          machinist who can't stand that his
          son's become more successful than
          himself.

                    CARL
          What you see, son, is a man who
          never measured success by the size
          of a man's wallet.

                    BUD
          That's because you never had the
          guts to go out into the world and
          stake your claim.

                    CARL
               (lamentably)
          Boy, if that's what you think, I
          must've really screwed up my job as
          a father.

     INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

     Bud and Carl exit the elevator and head across the luxury
     lobby.

                    CARL (CONT'D)
          ...as far as being axed, I'm still
          here and as long as I am, I have a
          responsibility not just to me but
          to the union members I represent...

                    BUD
               (pleading now)
          Your responsibility, Dad, is to
          present the facts, not your
          opinions, to the men... you're
          gonna destroy their lives, Dad!
          Don't do it to 'em. Give it a
          chance. Let the membership decide
          for themselves, Dad. Please.

                    CARL
          I'll be damned that when my men
          come to me tomorrow morning,
          wanting to know what's going on,
          I'm going to lie to them!

                    BUD
          Your men! All my life "your men"
          have been able to count on you? Why
          is it that you've never been there
          for me?

     They head through the doors, out onto the street.

     EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

     Bud following Carl.

                    BUD
          And what if you're wrong? What if
          one day, the sun didn't rise in the
          East and birds didn't fly South in
          winter and for once in your life
          your compass was off? Huh?

     He grabs Carl by the arm, stopping him.

                    BUD (CONT'D)
          Would you be willing to wreck your
          men's future? My future? Please...
          Dad. Think. Be practical, for a
          change. I'm asking you, I'm fucking
          begging you...

     Bud lets go of Carl's arm. Carl looks at his son, seeing the
     desperation. Sadness and confusion take hold of him.

                    CARL
          I don't sleep with no whore and I
          don't wake up with no whore. That's
          how I live with myself, Buddy. I
          don't know how you do.
               (a beat)
          I hope I'm wrong, I'll let them
          decide for themselves, that much I
          promise you.

     He walks away. Bud watches him go, knows he has won.

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bud, increasingly frazzled and determined, dark circles
     under his eyes paces with the phone...

                    JANET
               (his secretary)
          Mr. Dixon Brandt on 3...

                    BUD
               (wearily switching over)
          What's up Dixon?
               (stopping, focusing)
          Calm down! What are you talking about?

                              INTERCUT TO:

     INT. DIXON'S CABIN - ASPEN COLORADO - DAY

     Dixon, the rich man's son and ski bum, is yelling on the
     other end of the line.

                    DIXON
          ...this guy who said he was from
          the Security Exchange Commission,
          whatever the hell that is, calls
          and wants to ask me about that
          stock I bought...

                    BUD
               (nervous)
          What'd you tell him?

                    DIXON
          I told him I was in the bathroom
          and I'd call him right back. What
          the hell was I supposed to say
          Buddy, you got me into...

                    BUD
          Look Dixon, calm down! It's not
          illegal to buy stock or to be right.
          And it's not all that unusual to be
          spot checked on a big buy. Tell him
          you did your homework and you
          thought the stock was a sound
          investment.

                    DIXON
          What if he asks where I got the money?

                    BUD
          Tell 'em your father gave it to you.

                    DIXON
          What if they call him?

                    BUD
          They won't. That's not their
          jurisdiction.

                    DIXON
          You sure?

                    BUD
          Yes! Read the Constitution, it's
          all in there. And remember--you
          don't know anything, nothing.

                    DIXON
          I don't know anything!

                    BUD
          Good. Then call him back. And call
          me back. Don't worry.

     He hangs up, a worried expression, Marv entering to break
     his concentration.

                    MARV
          Hey you hear the news. I just got a
          job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat
          'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.

                    BUD
               (icy)
          Didn't I tell you to knock before
          you came in here?

                    MARV
          Hey the door was open.

                    BUD
          Then get out and close it behind you.

                    MARV
               (pause)
          You know what you need, buddy
          buddy--an optorectomy. That's when
          they cut the nerve that runs from
          your brain to your rectum--to
          change that shitty attitude of yours.

                    BUD
          Get the hell out!

     Marv slams the door on his way...

     EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DOWNTOWN NEW YORK - DAY

     Long shot of the towering stone structure. A tall angular
     figure crosses through the glass doors with a bulky folder
     under his arm...

     INT. LOBBY - DAY

     The man flashes his ID to a SECURITY GUARD who buzzes him
     through the gate... He walks towards us and we see he is the
     familiar tall, baby-faced INVESTIGATOR from the S.E.C.
     Options Watch Office... he gets in an elevator.

     INT. S.E.C. INVESTIGATION OFFICES - DAY

     He walks into the office of a CHIEF INVESTIGATOR. A balding
     sharp-featured man in a drab suit with bags of hard work
     under his eyes looks up as the young investigator places the
     large file in front of him.

     INT. ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - DAY

     Bud enters, preoccupied. Barnes is nervous.

                    BUD
          So what's the problem?

                    ROGER
               (whispers)
          ...got a strange call from the SEC.
          They asked to see my records...
          Bud, this is a heavy...

                    BUD
               (shrugs)
          ....Relax Roget
               (French pronunciation)
          You're 82M in the account numbers
          and I'm the Invisible Man...
          they're always looking for red
          flags, Gekko's always getting
          checked by them, they never come up
          with anything... we're invulnerable
          on this...

                    ROGER
          Alright... I just wanna slow down
          Bud... no more calls for awhile, no
          lunches... we suspend our business,
          alright...

                    BUD
          Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's
          cool.

     A young lawyer pops his head in the room.

                    LAWYER
          Rog, come on, bring the cost report.
          They started.
               (exits)


                    ROGER
               (standing, to Bud)
          Gekko asked us into the Bluestar
          deal. We're reviewing the
          timetables, wanna come?

                    BUD
               (surprised)
          He never told me...

                    ROGER
          You're just the President of the
          company, what do you know? ... Come
          on.

     As they walk out.

     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     Smoky, coffee cups and food. THREE LAWYERS, TWO INVESTMENT
     BANKERS, THREE COMMERCIAL BANKERS, sleeves rolled up, ties
     askew. A blackboard with Bluestar's assets diagrammed. A
     combat mood in the room. Bud walking in, feels vaguely
     worried, something is not quite right.

                    ROGER
          You guys know the new chief of
          Bluestar... Bud Fox.

     They nod vaguely respectful but Bud's obviously a figure
     head to them, takes a seat off to the side. The bull-like
     INVESTMENT BANKER, Vietnam vet, in shirt and suspenders, is
     on the attack against the stuffier Commercial Bankers.

                    INVESTMENT BANKER
          Look guys, what's the problem,
          let's for the kill...Gekko's got
          12% and climbing plus the unions
          are in his pocket for now,
          everybody on the street knows the
          stock's in play
               (overlapping voice:
               up 2 1/4 since the open)
          by next week the street's gonna own
          Bluestar and management won't be
          able to do anything but poison
          their own pill. Why are you guys
          dicking around? Is the bank
          financing in place or are we gonna
          have more and more meetings? Our
          firm's gonna guarantee 25% of the
          total debt structure in long-term
          junk bonds, now you guys either
          sign this piece of paper right now
          or we're gonna pull and head for
          another bank for the 75...

                    COMMERCIAL BANKER
               (older man, appeasing)
          ...look, we have 30 banks ready to
          participate in a 4 year revolving
          credit line but we have to have
          your assurance to pay back most of
          the loan in the first 6 months, and
          the only way...

                    INVESTMENT BANKER
               (intermittently interrupting)
          ... 30 banks, isn't that
          wonderful...you got it, no problem.

                    COMMERCIAL BANKER
               (insistent)
          ...and the only way we can see this
          happening is liquidating the
          hangars and the planes. Can you
          people guarantee that?

     Bud freezes where he sits...it all comes crashing down in a
     milli-second on that word "liquidate" -- shock now spreading
     on Bud's face...

                    INVESTMENT BANKER
          Guaranteed! No sweat...we already
          got the Bleezburg brothers lined up
          to build condos where the hangars
          are, we can lay off the planes with
          Mexicana, who are dumb enough to
          buy 'em and Texas Air is drooling
          at my kneecaps to get the slots and
          the routes. What's the problem?
          it's done..

                    ROGER
               (passing a paper to
               the commercial banker)
          This is the pricetag on the 737s,
          the gates, the hangars, the routes,
          we got it all nailed right down to
          the typewriters...

     Bud sits there numbly, a sickening feeling taking hold of
     him as the camera and music track and trap him tighter and
     tighter. The lawyers' voices distorting in the background.

                    INVESTMENT BANKER
          ...'course the beauty of it is the
          overfunded pension fund. Gekko gets
          the 75 million in there. Fifty
          million buys him the minimum
          annuities for 6,000 employees and
          he walks away with the rest. All
          in, he'll net 60 to 70 million. Not
          bad for a month's work.
               (to Bud)
          Your man did his homework, Fox,
          you're gonna have the shortest
          executive career since the Pope who
          got poisoned...now he'll really
          start believing he's "Gekko the
          Great."

     INT. RECEPTION AREA - GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bud walks intently past the receptionist and down the long
     white marble hall.

     INT. NATALIE'S DESK - DAY

     Natalie is on the phone. Bud marches past her desk.

                    NATALIE
          Yes, he wants to change that
          appointment to...
               (cupping the receiver)
          Bud--you can't go in there. He's in
          a meeting!

     He ignores her and throws open Gekko's door.

     INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

     Gekko is talking with the LAWYERS and BANKERS from the
     Bluestar deal, as Bud barges in.

                    GEKKO
               (looks up)
          I didn't know we had a meeting
          schedule for this morning.

                    BUD
          I'm sorry, this can't wait.

     Gekko stares at him with piercing eyes.

                    GEKKO
          Will you gentlemen excuse us for a
          few minutes?

     The lawyers and bankers get up and discreetly leave the room.
     Gekko waits for them to go, turns back to Bud.

                    GEKKO
          What the hell do you want?

                    BUD
          I found out about the garage sale
          down at Bluestar. Why?

     Gekko is taken by surprise.

                    GEKKO
          Last night I read Rudy the story of
          Winnie the Pooh and the Honey pot.
          Know what happened: he stuck his
          nose in that honey pot once too
          often and got stung.

                    BUD
          Maybe you ought to read him
          Pinocchio. You told me you were
          going to turn Bluestar around. Not
          upside down. You used me.

                    GEKKO
          You're walking around blind without
          a cane, sport. A fool and his money
          are lucky to get together in the
          first place.

                    BUD
          Why do you need to wreck this company?

                    GEKKO
          Because it's wreckable. I took
          another look and I changed my mind.

                    BUD
          If these people lose their jobs,
          nowhere to go. My father worked at
          Bluestar for twenty-four years. I
          gave 'em my word.

                    GEKKO
               (hard)
          It's all about bucks, kid, the rest
          is conversation...
               (loosening)
          Bud, you're still going to be
          president. And when the time comes,
          you'll parachute out a rich man.
          With the money you're going to
          make, your father won't have to
          work another day in his life.

                    BUD
          Tell me, Gordon--when does it all
          end? How many yachts can you
          waterski behind? How much is enough?

                    GEKKO
          Buddy, it's not a question of
          enough. It's a zero sum game, sport.
          Somebody wins and somebody loses.
          Money itself isn't lost or made,
          it's simply transferred from one
          perception to another. Like magic.
          That painting cost $60,000 10 years
          ago. I could sell it today for
          $600,000. The illusion has become
          real. And the more real it becomes,
          the more desperately they want it.
          Capitalism at its finest.

                    BUD
               (again)
          How much is enough Gordon?

                    GEKKO
          The richest one percent of this
          country owns half the country's
          wealth: 5 trillion dollars. One
          third of that comes from hard work,
          two thirds of it comes from
          inheritance, interest on interest
          accumulation to widows and idiot
          sons and what I do -- stock and
          real estate speculation. It's
          bullshit. Ninety percent of the
          American people have little or no
          net worth. I create nothing; I own.
          We make the rules, Buddy, the news,
          war, peace, famine, upheaval; the
          cost of a paper clip.
               (picking one up)
          We pull the rabbit out of the hat
          while everybody else sits around
          their whole life wondering how we
          did it...
               (crosses to Bud)
          ...you're not naive enough to think
          we're living in a democracy are
          you, Buddy? It's the free market.
          You're one of us now...take
          advantage of it. You got the killer
          instinct, kid, stick with me. I got
          things to teach you...

                    BUD
          Obviously...

     As he puts his arm around Bud, leading him to the door.

                    GEKKO
          Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna
          discuss this with you at the right
          time. Look, why don't you calm down
          and come to the apartment for
          dinner tonight. Bring Darien...

                    BUD
               (at the door,
               confused, drained)
          ...I can't make it tonight.

                    GEKKO
          Are you with me Buddy?

     At the door, a look of unmistakable power...and danger.

                    GEKKO
          I want you with me.
               (waits)


                    BUD
          I'm with you Gordon...

     He walks out the door, the misery he is in washing his brow.

                    GEKKO
               (to Natalie)
          ...be another minute, Natalie.

     As he crosses back to the coffee table and punches up a
     phone number.

                    GEKKO
          This is Gordon Gekko. Now...
               (a beat, with
               controlled rage)
          I want zip-locked mouths on
          Bluestar, or I'm gonna personally
          come down there and rip out your
          fucking throats!

     EXT. GEKKO OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

     Bud walks out, heading up the street, absent amid the
     scurrying mid-day hordes tearing up the street for the loot
     inside.

     EXT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

     Darien approaches, carrying groceries, enters the building.

     INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

     Bud is slumped on the couch, a spent bottle of tequila in
     front of him. Outside the twilight is quickening into night,
     shadows, scurrying across the unlit room.... for the first
     time we see him sucking on a cigarette.

     Darien opens the door and freezes, surveying the living room.
     A broken vase on the carpet, a curtain ripped off a window,
     a painting upended, a chair overturned, selected but not
     frenzied damage...

                    DARIEN
          Bud?...What's going on?

     She puts down the grocery bags, frightened.

                    BUD
          I've been played like a grand-
          piano--by the master, Gekko the
          Great...and today was the big crash.
          Liquidation sale. He's gonna carve
          Bluestar into little pieces and
          sell it all off...

     Darien registering this, is picking up pieces of the broken
     vase.

                    DARIEN
          I'm sorry. I was afraid something
          like this could happen.

                    BUD
          Talk about being bent over the sink
          of life and being dry humped. I
          handed it to him on a silver
          platter. I told my father and those
          people...

                    DARIEN
          Buddy, it's not your fault, and
          it's not your decision.

                    BUD
               (evenly)
          I'm not gonna let it happen Darien.

     She stops, lights a cigarette, growing concern.

                    DARIEN
          Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you.
          You've worked hard to get where you
          are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar
          someone else will; and who's to say
          they won't do the same thing.

                    BUD
          At least I wouldn't be pulling the
          trigger.

     She sighs...comes over, tries to shake some sense into him!

                    DARIEN
          Are you mad! Why are you doing this!
          We're so close, the town is going
          to be ours. Don't throw away your
          future Bud!

                    BUD
          I can stay with the brokerage firm.
          And you're doing fine. We can
          survive without Gordon Gekko.

                    DARIEN
               (pointed)
          I'm not looking to just survive.
          I've been doing that all my life.

                    BUD
               (getting the drift)
          What the hell's that supposed to mean?

     Darien moves out from his approximate circle, wrestling with
     what she wants to say...until she turns and says it.

                    DARIEN
          That if you make an enemy of Gordon
          Gekko, I won't be there to stand by
          you.

     Bud is stunned...and hurt.

                    BUD
          You really mean that?
               (lashing out)
          What'd he promise you? To take you
          public? I guess without Gordon's
          money and seal of approval, I'm not
          such a hot investment anymore.
          You're just the best money can buy,
          Darien...

                    DARIEN
          You're not exactly pure Bud, you
          went after Gekko with the same
          vengeance you went after me. Look
          in the mirror before...

                    BUD
               (glaring at her)
          I'm looking...and I sure don't like
          what I see.

     She collects her things and walks to the door.

                    DARIEN
          Fair enough...but it's not that
          simple, Bud. When I was down and
          had nothing, it was Gordon who
          helped me. He got me all my
          clients -- you among them...
               (snaps her fingers)
          and he can take it away like that.
               (a beat)
          You may find out one day -- that
          when you've had money and lost it,
          it's worse than never having had it
          at all.

     Bud steps across to her in a rage.

                    BUD
          That's bullshit! Step out that
          door, I'm changing the locks.

     She opens the door saddened.

                    DARIEN
          You may not believe this Bud but I
          really do care for you. I think we
          could've made a good team...but
          that's how it goes...

                    BUD
          Get the hell out!

     She does. Bud stares at the closed door, mute, numb, totally
     devastated.... the loss is not just Darien, it is total...
     He looks at his face in the reflection of a wall mirror...

     INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - DAY

     Waiting for the elevator. Darien also looks at herself a
     beat in the hall mirror. She's crying. Then she steels
     herself and enters the elevator.

     INT. BUD'S CONDO - DAY

     The same realtor, SYLVIe DRIMMER, who sold him the place, is
     back. The phone is ringing, unanswered...

                    SYLVIE
          ...well, the market's dead, hon,
          even the rich are bitching,
          nothing's moving except termites
          and cockroaches, and with my
          commission being what it is...

                    BUD
               (cutting her off)
          Save the rap, just sell it -- fast!

     He's in his socks, unshaven, smoking, he looks like he's
     been on a bender for the weekend. The phone stops ringing.
     He turns and walks into the bedroom, slamming the door
     behind him.

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bud walks in, a different, more serious look in his eye,
     purposeful. Past CAROLYN and JANET at the outer desk. They
     stop what they're doing and look up at him surprised.

                    CAROLYN
          Bud! Where you been the last two days?

                    BUD
               (ignoring the tone in
               her voice)
          ...Janet get my father on the phone
          and the two other union reps,
          urgent...

     He notices her face, something's wrong.

                    JANET
          Your mom just called, Mr. Fox. Your
          father... he...

                    BUD
               (sensing it)
          What! What happened?!

                    CAROLYN
          He had a heart attack, hon, but
          he's okay, he's at the hospital...

                    BUD
               (runs out)
          Oh Christ!
      
INT. BUD'S BMW - DAY

     Bud weaving fast through traffic.

     INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

     Bud races past the nurses' desks and down the hallway.

     EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     Bud's MOTHER is outside with Dominick Amato and another
     neighbor just visiting, bringing candies.

                    BUD
               (lighting a cigarette)
          Mom! How is he?

                    MOM
               (shaken)
          ...he was complaining about chest
          pains at work. Next thing I know he
          collapsed... Oh Buddy, talk to him,
          he's so stubborn.

                    AMATO
               (to Bud)
          ...don't worry, he's got another 20
          years in him. He's a tough ol' nut,
          your Dad...

     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     The blinds are drawn. His Dad lies there, tubes down his
     nose, hooked up to an IV unit and monitors. Bud comes over.
     Carl, glassy-eyed, significantly frailer, nods to him. It's
     obvious that more damage was done than Bud expected. Mom
     comes into the room with him, stands there.

                    BUD
          Hiya Dad...
               (sits, smiles)
          What was it? Mom talked too much or
          was it her spaghetti? I mean
          pasta...
               (Mom bringing a
               handkerchief to her eyes)
          I told you never to lift a 747 by
          yourself...

     Carl, smiles weakly, on pain killers. Bud pulls out a
     cigarette. He fumbles with it before putting it away, trying
     to keep a gruff tone between them.

                    BUD
          ...you even got me smoking
          now...second one Dad, you're
          pushing your luck, I guess you know
          that...I guess you gotta pull
          through this one Dad...for mom, for
          me...I guess I never told you
          but...I love you Dad, I love you
          more than I ever.
               (begins to weep)
          ...I didn't mean those things I
          said to you...you're a hero all the
          way Dad, you're a rock...the best.

     The words seem to come flowing out of Bud as Carl's eyes
     fill with tears.

                    BUD
          ...and you were right about Gekko.
          He's one son of a bitch...through
          and through.

     Carl stares at him, beginning to understand.

                    BUD (CONT'D)
          He's gonna break up Bluestar.

     Carl reacts violently in his eyes but Bud soothes him...in
     dead earnest, trying to be deliberate and clear in his meaning.

                    BUD (CONT'D)
          ...but I gotta plan Dad, it can
          work, I can save the airline, I
          know you got no reason to believe
          me but I want you to trust me...I
          need to talk to the unions...Can I
          speak for you?

     Carl's eyes.

                    BUD (CONT'D)
          Your words, not mine...

                    CARL
               (weakly)
          You speak for me, son.

     INT. AUCTION ROOM - DAY

     Gekko and Darien are seated together in the back row. Darien
     looks serious and distracted in spite of all the excitement
     going on around her. It is the big spring Impressionist sale
     and all the major players, or their representatives are here.
     Gekko is bidding.

                    GEKKO
          Look over there sunshine. I'm up
          against Richard Feigen.

     He is on a roll, electric. As the price mounts and surpasses
     the two million dollar mark, Gekko rises and walks down the
     side aisle to the front, never taking his eyes away from the
     auctioneer. He stands agressively, arms akimbo, in a nose to
     nose confrontation.

                    AUCTIONEER
          Once, twice, three times. Sold to
          Mr. Gordon Gekko.

     EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF AUCTION HOUSE - DAY

     They walk the sunny streets, a jubilant Gekko, savoring his
     triumph, grabs Darien's arm.

                    GEKKO
          What do you say we go get a suite
          at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne?
          Celebrate, just like the old times
          Sunshine.

                    DARIEN
               (indignantly)
          Those days are over, Gordon. They
          were over a long time ago.

                    GEKKO
               (condescendingly but
               paying little
               attention to the rebuff)
          Can't blame me for trying. You look
          as beautiful as that painting I
          just bought.

     He pats her on the back in a preprietary fashion.

                    GEKKO (CONT'D)
               (mockingly)
          So what's the problem Sunshine? You
          look like Black Thursday. Bad case
          of puppy love?

                    DARIEN
               (indignant)
          It's not puppy love, Gordon.
          Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.

                    GEKKO
               (off handed)
          Sorry to hear that. I thought the
          kid had staying power.

                    DARIEN
          It's over you, Gordon.

                    GEKKO
               (cooly)
          You told him about us?

                    DARIEN
          No, are you crazy? And I don't want
          him ever to know. Do you
          understand?...

     She moves closed and takes Gordon's hand.

                    DARIEN (CONT'D)
          I want to ask you a big favor,
          Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.

                    GEKKO
               (stroking her face)
          Now tell me, why would I want to do
          that?

                    DARIEN
          Because I don't want to see him hurt.

                    GEKKO
          Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had
          a little talk. We came to an
          understanding.
               (takes her hand paternally)
          I want you to go back to him.
          Soothe him. Help keep his head
          straight. Okay?

                    DARIEN
          I can't...and I won't.

                    GEKKO
          Come on, we both like Buddy. But
          this bleeding heart puppy love act
          is over the top... It doesn't fit.

                    DARIEN
          Maybe it does. Don't patronize me
          Gordon.

                    GEKKO
          You and I are the same, Darien.
          We're smart enough not to buy into
          the oldest myth running: love... A
          fiction created by people who got
          nothing to keep them from jumping
          out of windows.

                    DARIEN
          You're really twisted, Gordon.
          You're incapable of giving to
          anybody because deep down inside
          you there's a poverty that every
          last dollar in the world won't fill.

                    GEKKO
          Ooh ooh, tough talk from a scared
          little girl all wrapped in a pretty
          grown-up package. Does this mean
          you're ready to cut the umbilical
          cord and step out into the world on
          your own? Because, Darien, if
          you're through with me, you're
          through with everything I'm a part of.

     Darien's eyes cloud over...the look of a scared child being
     banished by her father. Then...

                    DARIEN
          I know...but maybe, just maybe
          Gordon, I'm good enough so I don't
          need you anymore.

     She walks away.

     INT. MCGREGOR'S BAR - QUEENS - DAY

     Bud is seated at a corner table with the BLUESTAR UNION
     REPS: Duncan Wilmore, ALPA LEADER and Toni Carpenter, AFA
     rep; also jointed by machinists, Dominick Amato and Charley
     Dent, sitting in for his father's union.

                    BUD
          ...the stock's at 19 1/4 and it's
          going up. Gekko figures by breaking
          up Bluestar, it's worth at least
          $30 a share. That means he'll buy
          up to 23 or 24 and still think he's
          making money.

                    WILMORE
          How do you know that the stock is
          going to go up?

                    BUD
               (pointedly)
          You really don't want to know any
          more than that, Mr. Wilmore. Let's
          just say I have some friends.

                    WILMORE
               (getting his drift)
          Okay. What happens then?

                    BUD
          When the stock hits 23, you guys go
          to Gekko and lower the boom. Once
          he learns he has no union
          concession, he's going to head for
          the hills. He'll sell everything
          he's got.

                    CARPENTER
          Yeah. But who's going to buy then
          and what's to prevent another shark
          from coming along and devouring us?

     INT. WILDMAN BUILDING - FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY

     Bud, Duncan Wilmore, Toni Carpenter, Dominick and Charley,
     an unlikely looking group in the plushness of the apartment
     lobby.

                    BUD
          We have an appointment to see Mr.
          Wildman.

     INT. WILDMAN APARTMENT - DAY

     Lofty windows overlooking the Park, an impeccably-decorated
     apartment with coffee and rolls laid out, a young AIDE
     quietly moving around. Bud and the others are on sofas
     around the imposing figure of Wildman in a chair across.

                    BUD
          Sir Lawrence, what would you say to
          owning Bluestar Airlines with union
          concessions--at $18 a share...and
          in the process hanging Gordon Gekko
          out in the wind to twist.... ?

     Sir Lawrence leans back in his chair, equably...

                    WILDMAN
          I might be very interested, but why?
          Why you mate -- how'd you get mixed
          up with Gekko? He doesn't know the
          difference between raiding and
          insider trading. I do. The SEC does.
          I hope you do...

                    BUD
          Let's just say Mr. Gekko and I have
          a conflict of interest. I want to
          see this airline work...
               (pointing to the
               documents in front of Wildman)
          ...the figures here show it can.

                    WILDMAN
               (to the others)
          ... and you're prepared to take
          these large salary cuts.

                    WILMORE
          ...we are. But we want a contract
          agreement -- iron-clad -- that if
          you buy it, you can't break it up.

                    WILDMAN
               (hands behind his head)
          I'm still listening...

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bud hurries in, past Marv on the phone with an irate customer.

                    MARV
          Well, if that's how you feel--the
          hell with you too. And strong
          letter to follow.

     He slams the phone down.

                    BUD
          You don't have to agree with me,
          Marv; but I think I've been a bit
          of a schmuck lately.
               (beat, waits)


                    MARV
               (off the cuff)
          I agree. Go thou and sin no more.

                    BUD
          I want to make it up to you.
          Bluestar, put all your clients in it.

                    MARV
               (animated, grabs the phone)
          Thanks, buddy, buddy, I'm back.
          Say, Buddy, those optorectomies do
          work wonders.

     Bud intersecting Lou Mannheim smoking a cigarette and having
     a hard time walking.

                    BUD
          Bluestar, Mr. Mannheim. Put all
          your clients in it.

     Davls looks gravely at Bud.

                    MANNHEIM
          I don't know where you get your
          information, son, but I don't like
          it. The only reason I'm gonna do it
          is...I need the money, that's the
          problem with money--it makes you do
          things you don't want to do.

     Bud hears him, walks on...

                    MARV
               (into phone)
          Miss Bloom, Marvin. You got cancer
          in your portfolio, but I got the
          cure...Bluestar Airlines...

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bud on the phone, checking his quotron.

                    BUD
          Listen I need a favor and it's a
          quick scalp for you. Two hundred
          thousand at 19 1/2; can you
          position it in one of your equity
          funds?

                    JANET
               (voicebox)
          ...call waiting on 7.

                    BUD
          Hold on...
               (switches over, hushed)
          ...listen "blue horseshoe loves
          Bluestar Airlines"...

     Immediately goes back to the other line.

     INT. THE WALL STREET JOURNAL OFFICES - DAY

     The REPORTER, who Bud anonymously called on the earlier
     Anacott Steel buy, hangs up. He rises from his desk and
     crosses the busy news floor, over to his EDITOR.

                    WSJ REPORTER
          Bluestar's in play.

     INT. NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

     A RUNNER dashes up to the BLUESTAR AIRLINES post, where a
     heated crowd is gathered, amidst heavy trading. He elbows
     his way over to a TRADER, handing him the ticket. The TRADER
     holds up the buy order, screaming, making frantic hand
     signals, in search of a seller. Faces in the crowd look up
     at the broad tape.

     CAMERA TILTS TO:

     BLUESTAR (BST), the stock quote flashing across the BROAD
     TAPE--upticking to 20 1/4.

     INT. BROKERAGE OFFICE - DAY

     Marv, on the phone pitching, eyes glued to the office TAPE--
     as BST jumps to 21 1/4.

                    MARV
          I love it...I do love it so!

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     The quotron now climbs to 22 1/8!

                    BUD
               (into phone)
          Yeah. I see it at 22 1/8 and I
          don't know what to make of it.

     INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

     He paces on the other end of the phone, real anger showing;
     now Alex and Susan seen in b.g.

                    GEKKO
          The word's out. Your union buddies
          are talking. Get me in at a 45
          degree angle and I mean all the way
          in! Slash and burn, buy everything
          you can get up to 22. Then call me.
          When I get the sonofabitch who
          leaked this I'm gonna kill him! I'm
          gonna tear his eyeballs out, I'm
          gonna suck his skull!!

     As he glances at his quotron the stock ticks up another 1/8th.

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     All the BROKERS have jumped into the action, avidly watching
     Bluestar's stock climb on the BROAD TAPE. Bud sweeps into
     the room and looks up at the board as the stock hits 22 7/8.

                    MARV
          The stock's going to Pluto!

                    BUD
          Start unloading.

                    MARV
          Sell?

                    BUD
          Now! Tell everyone to dump!

     Marv nods, and rushes away. Bud crosses past Mannheim's office.

                    BUD
          Get out of Bluestar!

     In background Marv is spreading the word, brokers frantically
     grabbing phones, calling clients to sell.

     INT. GEKKO'S OFFICE - DAY

     Gekko looks up from his quotron and shouts to his troops on
     the phones.

                    GEKKO
          Who the hell's out there? What are
          the arbs saying? It's gotta be a
          big hitter.

                    ALEX
          They don't know what's going on!

                    SUSAN
          Everybody and his mother is buying!

     Natalie enters the room, flustered.

                    NATALIE
          Mr. Gekko, there's a whole bach of
          people from Bluestar Airlines
          outside demanding to see you.

                    GEKKO
          What the hell do they want?

                    WILMORE (O.S.)
          I'd be happy to tell you.

     As Duncan, Toni Carpenter, Dominick Amato, Charley Dent and
     SEVERAL other assorted UNION MEMBERS march into the room.
     Gekko is taken by surprise, but stays calm.

                    WILMORE
          We know what you're up to, Gekko,
          and let me tell you this from here,
               (hits his heart)
          you suck eggs, mister, over my dead
          body you ain't gonna break up
          Bluestar.

                    GEKKO
          You guys must know something nobody
          else knows. If those are my plans,
          it's the first I've heard of it.

                    CARPENTER
          Would you care to put that in writing?

                    GEKKO
          I'd like to remind you we already
          have an agreement, which I expect
          you to honor.

                    WILMORE
          Well in that case, I hope you have
          your pilot's license.

                    AMATO
          Don't worry, Gekko, we wouldn't let
          the engines fall out of the plane.

                    CARPENTER
               (regretfully)
          But the reservations systems can
          get awfully screwed up, if we're
          not paying attention.
      
               CHARLEY DENT
          And a lot of baggage headed to St.
          Petersburg could easily find its
          way to Pittsburgh.

                    GEKKO
          Listen, you clowns, there's
          somebody else out there trying to
          buy your airline, if you want to be
          Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla
          the Hun be my guest!

                    WILMORE
          We'll take our chances.
               (tips his hat)
          Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.

     They file out of the room. The phone lines have lit up like
     a Christmas tree. Alex answers a call.

                    ALEX
               (to Gekko)
          Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What
          do you want him to do?

                    GEKKO
               (fractional pause, mad)
          Sell it all.
               (then, evenly)
          What the hell, so I'll only make
          ten million.

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     Bud switches lines from Gekko to Larry Wildman.

          Gekko's on the ropes--he's trying
          to sell, but there's not many
          takers, the stock's plummeting.

     EXT. WILDMAN'S YACHT - DAY

     Wildman is off the Long Island Sound waters in his boat
     lighting a cigar. Two beautiful women and an aide are with him.

                    WILDMAN
          Well then... guess I'll have to
          carry him a few rounds before he
          drops.

     Switches lines, checking his quotron...

                    WILDMAN
          Bluestar. Don't make a big deal.
          Buy it lightly on the way down.
               (emphatically)
          When it hits 18--buy it all.

     INT. NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE FLOOR - DAY

     Wildman's broker takes the order with a curt "got it" and
     dashes out of the cubicle over to the Bluestar post where a
     chaotic crowd is gathered, traders frantically screaming to
     sell Bluestar shares. He looks at the Big Board--sees an XTR
     drop to 17. When he raises his hand to buy, he is mobbed.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

          We're being devoured, Gordon.

     Harold Salt, walking on egg shells, looks to Gekko, who sits
     with the phone receiver crooked to his neck.

                    HAROLD
          There's got to be a way out of
          this, Gordon.

                    GEKKO

          Yeah, Harold, why don't you dial
          911.

          Look, you got me into this airline,
          and you damn well better get me out.

          don't. The bid is 17 and going down.
          As your broker, I advise you to
          take it.

     Bud moves the phone away from his ear, at Gekko's cursing,
     and signs the ticket.

                    BUD
               (urgent)
          Gordon, it's two minutes to close.

     INT. GEKKO'S DEN - NEW YORK APARTMENT - TWILIGHT

     The 35" television is on to:

                    NEWSCASTER
          The big Wall Street story tonight
          is the  roller coaster ride of
          Bluestar Airlines. Fueled by
          takeover rumors, the stock soared
          to an all-time high of 24 1/8. Then
          when contradictory rumors later
          surfaced that the takeover was
          unfounded, buyers went running for
          cover, and the stock plummeted on
          gigantic volume to as low as 16 1/2
          before closing at 17.

     Camera discovers Gekko sitting, grimly watching the report.
     Rudy seen riding his toy car in background.

                    NEWSCASTER
          ...but then tonight, amidst all the
          scuttlebutt, another rumble shook
               (a beat)
          According to many sources, raider
          Sir Lawrence Wildman has stepped in
          and bought a substantial block of
          Bluestar and is going to announce a
          deal tomorrow at 18 that includes
          the support of the unions.

     Camera now tracks in close on Gekko as he absorbs the
     unexpected blow. O.S. Rudy yelling and squealing. Gekko
     leans back, putting the pieces together, his eyes narrowing
     into burning slits. He smashes the glass cocktail table with
     a massive paperweight as Kate hears it, shocked.

     EXT. WALL STREET - MORNING

     People rushing to work. Bud crosses the street, his face
     buried in The Financial Times. Insert: "SIR LAWRENCE WILDMAN
     MOUNTS BLUESTAR BUY WITH UNION SUPPORT".

     Satisfied, Bud folds the paper and heads into his office
     building.

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     He walks past Carolyn the receptionist who is strangely mute...

                    BUD
          Smile, Carolyn, there's justice in
          the world...

     INT. MAIN OFFICE - DAY

     He passes the CHINESE STOCKLADY. She sees him and manages to
     look away. Marvin exchanges a look with him but can't bring
     himself to talk. Bud wonders...the whole office seems
     silent, the other BROKERS stealing glances.

     ...as he passes Lou Mannheim with Charlie Cushing, who
     ignores Bud...

                    BUD
          How's it going Mr. Mannheim? Got
          out of Bluestar in time I hope?

     Mannheim stops, winds up. Bud impatient but polite.

                    MANNHEIM
               (with gruff affection)
          Bud I like you, just remember
          something. Man looks in the abyss,
          there's nothing staring back at him.
          At that time a man finds his
          character--and that is what keeps
          him out of the abyss...
               (a beat, looks deeply)


                    BUD
          I think I understand what you mean
          Mr. Mannheim.

     But not really. As, on this increasingly strange morning, he
     moves on past Janet who wants to tell his something but he
     cuts her off.

                    BUD
          Get my father will you Janet?

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     As Bud walks in, the camera glides to reveal the young SEC
     INVESTIGATOR, who has been tracking Buddy, going through his
     files. A SECOND MAN, PATTERSON, is standing behind the desk
     using the phone as a bored-looking 3RD MAN and POLICEMAN
     stand off to the side with Hieronymus Lynch, who gives Bud a
     withering glance.

                    PATTERSON
               (into phone)
          He just came in. I'll talk to you
          later.

     On Bud--a struck-dumb look passing to resignation, as if for
     a long time now, he has been expecting this.

                    BUD
          I guess you're not here to open an
          IRA.

                    PATTERSON
          Mr Fox, I'm Henry Patterson from
          the Postal Inspection Service...
          this is Evan Morrissey with The
          Securities and Exchange
          Investigation Office.
               (presents his ID and
               indicates MAN 3)
          ... Mr. Ebanhopper from the US
          Attorney's Office.

                    MORRISSEY
          Mr. Fox, you're under arrest for
          conspiracy to commit securities
          fraud and for violating the Insider
          Trader's Sanction Act.

     The handcuffs come out.

     EXT. SHEEPSMEADOW - CENTRAL PARK - TWILIGHT

     Long shot. Activity is winding down, a few sunbathers
     collecting their blankets. A solitary figure stands on a
     hill silhouetted by the sunset. A second figure appears on a
     footpath and starts climbing the hill towards the other man.

     Gekko waits, expressionless... Bud approaches him. They
     stand facing each other.

                    GEKKO
          Hello Bud.

                    BUD
          Gordon.

                    GEKKO
          You sandbagged me on Bluestar.
               (smiles)
          I guess you think you taught the
          teacher a lesson, that you can make
          the tail wag the dog, huh?

     Bud looks away. Gekko's smile fades.

                    GEKKO (CONT'D)
          Well let me cue you in: the ice is
          melting under your feet sport...

     Without warning, he grabs Buddy roughly by the lapels and
     lets out his inner rage with a series of smacks and slaps
     across his face.

                    GEKKO (CONT'D)
          You think you could've gotten this
          far this fast with anybody else?
          You think you could be out there
          dicking somebody like Darien? No,
          you'd be cold calling dentists and
          widows to buy twenty shares of some
          dog stock! I took you in! A nobody!
          I opened doors for you!...I showed
          you how the system works!...

     Gekko slapping him harder and harder, Buddy staggering with
     the blows, saying nothing, not defending himself.

                    GEKKO (CONT'D)
          ...the value of information! How
          you get it! Anacott Steel, Brant
          Resources, Transuniversal, Fulham
          Oil. And this is how you pay back,
          you cockroach! I gave you Darien, I
          gave you your manhood. I gave you
          everything.

     He backhands Bud across the face. Bud lies on the ground,
     spent, as is Gordon breathing hard. Bud gets to his knees,
     blood streaming from his nose, his suit muddied. Passersby
     look on, wondering.

     Gekko seems to relent, the rage going into hurt, remorse. He
     hands Bud a handkerchief. Bud staunches the flow of blood
     from his nose.

                    GEKKO (CONT'D)
               (softly, innocently)
          You could've been one of the great
          ones Bud...I look at you and see
          myself...Why?

     Bud looks at Gordon, torn by mixed emotions: the bonds they
     share and the betrayal wrought.

                    BUD
               (shakes his head, thoughtfully)
          I don't know. My Dad once told me,
          "money is something you need in
          case you don't die tomortow." I
          guess I realized I'm just Bud Fox.
          And as much as I wanted to be
          Gordon Gekko--I'll always be Bud Fox.

     He looks at Gordon, as if wanting to say more, but doesn't.

     In long shot, Gordon stands alone as Bud walks away.

     EXT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN RESTAURANT - EVENING

     The DOORMAN looks askance. Bud, mud-splattered suit and
     bloody nose, walks straight past him thru the door.

     INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     Several well-heeled DINERS look up from their haute cuisine,
     at the sight of Bud making his way toward the men's room.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Tight on Bud, staring at his reflection in the mirror, as he
     unbuttons his shirt, revealing adhesive tape swathed across
     his chest. Camera paces back as he winces when...

     MORRISSEY and AGOSTINI, the two investigators, rip the tape
     off his chest, retrieving a small tape recorder. Morrissey
     of the S.E.C. rewinds the cassette. We hear Gekko's voice
     being played back on the tape, the mention of their deals.

                    MORRISSEY
          You did the right thing, Bud.

     Bud looks searchingly in the mirror. Faint CLICKING NOISE
     comes up over the shot.

     INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY

     CLICKING of the Broad Tape grows LOUDER. Shots of Lou
     Mannheim, Lynch, Marv; silently looking up at the green
     fluorescent print-out.

     THE TAPE--THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TODAY ANNOUNCED
     CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST CORPORATE RAIDER GORDON GEKKO AND
     STOCK BROKER BUD FOX, FOR CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT SECURITIES
     FRAUD, TAX EVASION, VIOLATIONS OF SECURITY ACTS, AND MAIL
     FRAUD...

                              DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. CARL FOX'S HOUSE - QUEENS - DAY

     Carl, dressed in a suit and tie, sits at the dining table,
     finished breakfast plates in front of him, refilling his
     coffee cup. Mom clearing off the table, anxious...

     As Bud walks in, wearing a suit and tie. He looks tired,
     beaten, the eyes lifeless, in a dark mood.

                    MOM
               (disapproving)
          ...don't wear that tie Buddy, it...

     She cuts off on Bud's look.

                    CARL
          Another cup of coffee?

                    BUD
          No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.

                    CARL
               (checks his watch)
          I guess it's time to hit the road.

                    BUD
          Yeah, don't want to be late for my
          own funeral.

     INT. CARL FOX'S SEDAN - LOWER MANHATTAN - DAY

     Driving towards the Federal Courtrooms in Lower Manhattan.
     Busy traffic all around.

                    CARL
               (supportively)
          ...you told the truth, you gave the
          money back. All things considered--
          in this cockamamie world--you're
          shooting par...

                    MOM
          ...you helped save the airline and
          the people at the airline are gonna
          remember you for it.

                    CARL
          ...if I was you, I'd think about
          that Bluestar job Wildman's offered
          you...

                    BUD
          Dad, I'm going to jail and you know
          it.

                    CARL
               (shaking his head, sober)
          Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe
          so. It's gonna be rough on you but
          maybe in some screwed up way,
          that's the best thing that can
          happen to you...stop trading for
          the quick buck and go produce
          something with your life, create,
          don't live off the buying and
          selling of others...

                    MOM
          ...you can do it, Bud, once you set
          your mind to something, I believe
          you can do anything in the world...

     Bud stares ahead, registering it.

                    CARL
               (nods, then)
          ...got any friends gonna be there?

     As he pulls the car into the curb. The Federal Building, in
     approaching POV, looms large before them.

                    BUD
               (looks around, ironic)
          Like who? Who really wants to know
          a convicted felon...I don't even
          like myself.

     Carl knows something Bud doesn't...

     Darien is standing there waiting as they approach the main
     entrance... Bud seeing her, suddenly stunned. His POV--
     easing along the curb.

                    CARL
          So, why don't you get out here and
          go in with your friend, I'll park
          the car. Try to be cool, okay?

     A last look with his father.

     EXT. CURBSIDE - FEDERAL BUILDING - LOWER MANHATTAN - DAY

     Bud getting out...crossing to Darien. A pause.

                    DARIEN
               (nervous)
          Hi.

                    BUD
          Why?

                    DARIEN
          I figure a guy who's made some
          mistakes should be able to
          understand a girl who's made some
          of her own...

     Bud looking at her, moves closer, longing and hope and
     happiness have returned to his dull eyes... and forgiveness,
     the greatest of all.

     They embrace. Bud will never know about her past, nor need
     he. The camera leaving them on a slanting, circular crane,
     lifting past the Federal Building to a panorama of Wall
     Street in all its icy magisterial splendor...and thus ends
     our tale.

                      THE END
