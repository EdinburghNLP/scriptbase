Abrupt medium close-up of Alvy Singer doing a comedy monologue.  He
wearing a crumbled sports jacket and tieless shirt; the background is stark.

                    ALVY         
          There's an old joke.  Uh, two elderly 
          women are at a Catskills mountain 
          resort, and one of 'em says: "Boy, the 
          food at this place is really terrible." 
          The other one says, "Yeah, I know, and 
          such ... small portions." Well, that's 
          essentially how I feel about life.  Full 
          of loneliness and misery and suffering 
          and unhappiness, and it's all over much 
          too quickly.  The-the other important 
          joke for me is one that's, uh, usually 
          attributed to Groucho Marx, but I think 
          it appears originally in Freud's wit and 
          its relation to the unconscious.  And it 
          goes like this-I'm paraphrasing: Uh ... 
          "I would never wanna belong to any club 
          that would have someone like me for a 
          member." That's the key joke of my adult 
          life in terms of my relationships with 
          women.  Tsch, you know, lately the 
          strangest things have been going 
          through my mind, 'cause I turned forty, 
          tsch, and I guess I'm going through a 
          life crisis or something, I don't know. 
          I, uh ... and I'm not worried about aging.  
          I'm not one o' those characters, you know. 
          Although I'm balding slightly on top, that's 
          about the worst you can say about me.  I, 
          uh, I think I'm gonna get better as I get 
          older, you know?  I think I'm gonna be the-
          the balding virile type, you know, as 
          opposed to say the, uh, distinguished 
          gray, for instance, you know?  'Less I'm 
          neither o' those two. Unless I'm one o' 
          those guys with saliva dribbling out of 
          his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria 
          with a shopping bag screaming about 
          socialism. 
               (Sighing) 
          Annie and I broke up and I-I still can't 
          get my mind around that.  You know, I-I 
          keep sifting the pieces of the relationship 
          through my mind and-and examining my life 
          and tryin' to figure out where did the 
          screw-up come, you know, and a year ago we 
          were... tsch, in love.  You know, and-and-and 
          ... And it's funny, I'm not-I'm not a 
          morose type.  I'm not a depressive character.  
          I-I-I, uh, 
               (Laughing) 
          you know, I was a reasonably happy kid, 
          I guess.  I was brought up in Brooklyn 
          during World War II.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE-DAY

Alvy as young boy sits on a sofa with his  mother in an old-fashioned, 
cluttered doctor's office.  The doctor stands near the sofa, holding a 
cigarette and listening.

                    MOTHER 
               (To the doctor) 
          He's been depressed.  All off a sudden, 
          he can't do anything.

                    DOCTOR 
               (Nodding) 
          Why are you depressed, Alvy?
 
                    MOTHER 
               (Nudging Alvy) 
          Tell Dr. Flicker. 
               (Young Alvy sits, his head down.  His 
               mother answers for him) 
          It's something he read.

                    DOCTOR 
               (Puffing on his cigarette and 
               nodding) 
          Something he read, huh?  

                    ALVY 
               (His head still down) 
          The universe is expanding.

                    DOCTOR 
          The universe is expanding?

                    ALVY 
               (Looking up at the doctor) 
          Well, the universe is everything, and if 
          it's expanding, someday it will break apart 
          and that would be the end of everything!

Disgusted, his mother looks at him.

                    MOTHER 
               (shouting) 
          What is that your business? 
               (she turns back to the doctor) 
          He stopped doing his homework.

                    ALVY 
          What's the point?

                    MOTHER 
               (Excited, gesturing with her hands) 
          What has the universe got to do with it?  
          You're here in Brooklyn!  Brooklyn is not 
          expanding!

                    DOCTOR 
               (Heartily, looking down at Alvy) 
          It won't be expanding for billions of years 
          yet, Alvy.  And we've gotta try to enjoy 
          ourselves while we're here.  Uh?

He laughs.

Fall shot of house with an amusement-park roller-coaster ride built over it. 
A line of cars move up and then slides with great speed while out the window 
of the house a band shakes a dust mop.

          memories, but I swear I was brought up

INT. HOUSE

Alvy as a child sits at the table eating soup and reading a comic book while 
his father sits on the sofa reading the paper.  The house shakes with every 
move of the roller coaster.

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
          -coaster in the Coney Island section of 
          Brooklyn.  Maybe that accounts for my 
          personality, which is a little nervous, I 
          think.

CUT TO:

Young Alvy at the food-stand concession watching three military men 
representing the Army, the Navy and the Marines arm in arm with a blond woman 
in a skirted bathing suit.  They all turn and run toward the foreground.  The 
girl stops before the camera to lean over and throw a kiss.  The sign over the 
concession reads "Steve's Famous Clam Bar.  Ice Cold Beer, "and the roller 
coaster is moving in full gear in the background.

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
          You know, I have a hyperactive imagination.  
          My mind tends to jump around a little, and 
          have some trouble between fantasy and reality.

                                        CUT TO:

Full shot of people in bumper cars thoroughly enjoying bumping into each other 
as Alvy father stands in the center of the track directing traffic.

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
          My father ran the bumper-car concession. 
               (Alvy as a child moves into the frame 
               driving a bumper car.  He stops as other 
               cars bombard him.  His father continues 
               to direct the traffic) 
          There-there he is and there I am.  But I-I-I-I 
          used to get my aggression out through those 
          cars all the time.

Alvy backs up his car off screen.

INT. SCHOOLROOM - DAY

The camera pans over three austere-looking teachers standing in front of the 
blackboard.  The chalk writing on the board changes as each teacher lectures. 
While Alvy speaks, one of the male teachers puts an equation on the blackboard.
- "2 X 10 = 20 " and other arithmetic formulas.

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
          I remember the staff at our public 
          school.  You know, we had a saying, uh, 
          that "Those who can't do, teach, and 
          those who can't teach, teach gym." And 
          ...uh, h'h, of course, those who couldn't 
          do anything, I think, were assigned to 
          our school.  I must say-

                                        CUT TO:

A female teacher standing in front of an old-fashioned schoolroom.  The 
blackboard behind her reads "Transportation Administration. The camera pans 
her point of view: a group of young students sitting behind their desks.  Alvy 
as a child sits in a center desk wile all around him there is student activity;
there is note-passing, ruler-tapping, nose-picking, gumchewing.

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
          I always felt my schoolmates were idiots.  
          Melvyn Greenglass, you know, fat little 
          face, and Henrietta Farrell, just Miss 
          Perfect all the time.  And-and Ivan 
          Ackerman, always the wrong answer.  Always. 

Ivan stands up behind his desk.

                    IVAN 
          Seven and three is nine.

Alvy hits his forehead with his hand.  Another student glances over at him, 
reacting.

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
          Even then I knew they were just jerks. 
               (The camera moves back to the teacher, 
               who is glaring out at her students) 
          In nineteen forty-two I had already dis-

As Alvy talks, the camera shows him move from his seat and kiss a young girl.  
She jumps from her seat in disgust, rubbing her cheek, as Alvy moves back to 
his seat.

                    1ST GIRL 
               (Making noises) 
          Ugh, he kissed me, he kissed me.

                    TEACHER 
               (Off screen) 
          That's the second time this month!  Step 
          up here!

As the teacher, really glaring now, speaks, Alvy rises from his seat and moves 
over to her.  Angry, she points with her band while the students turn their 
heads to watch what will happen next.

                    ALVY 
          What'd I do?

                    TEACHER 
          Step up here!

                    ALVY 
          What'd I do?

                    TEACHER 
          You should be ashamed of yourself.

The students, their heads still turned, look back at Alvy, now an adult, 
sitting in the last seat of the second row.

                    ALVY (AS ADULT) 
               (First off screen, then onscreen as 
               camera moves over to the back of the 
               classroom) 
          Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual 
          curiosity.

                    TEACHER 
               (The younger, Alvy standing next to her) 
          Six-year-old boys don't have girls on 
          their minds.

                    ALVY (AS ADULT) 
               (Still sitting in the back of 
               the classroom) 
          I did. 

The girl the young Alvy kissed turns to the older Alvy, she gestures and 
speaks.

                    1ST GIRL 
          For God's sakes, Alvy, even Freud speaks 
          of a latency period.

                    ALVY (AS ADULT) 
               (Gesturing) 
          Well, I never had a latency period.  I 
          can't help it.

                    TEACHER
               (With young, Alvy still at her side) 
          Why couldn't you have been more like Donald? 
               (The camera pans over to Donald, 
               sitting up tall in his seat, then 
               back to the teacher) 
          Now, there was a model boy!

                    ALVY (AS CHILD) 
               (Still standing next to the teacher) 
          Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.

                    DONALD 
          I run a profitable dress company.

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
          Right.  Sometimes I wonder where my 
          classmates are today.

The camera shows the full classroom, the students sitting behind their desks, 
the teacher standing in the front of the room.  One at a time, the young 
students rise u from their desks and speak.

                    1ST BOY 
          I'm president of the Pinkus Plumbing Company.

                    2ND BOY 
          I sell tallises.

                    3RD BOY 
          I used to be a heroin addict.  Now I'm a 
          methadone addict. 

                    2ND GIRL 
               I'm into leather.

INT. ROOM

Close-up of a TV screen showing Alvy as an adult on a talk show.  He sits next 
to the show, host, Dick Cavett, a Navy man sits on his right.  Static is heard 
throughout the dialogue.

                    ALVY 
          I lost track of most of my old schoolmates, 
          but I wound up a comedian.  They did not take 
          me in the Army.  I was, uh ... Interestingly 
          enough, I was-I was four-P.

Sounds of TV audience laughter and applause are heard.

                    DICK CAVETT 
          Four-P?

                    ALVY 
          Yes.  In-in-in-in the event of war, I'm a 
          hostage.

More audience laughter joined by Dick Cavett and the naval officer.

INT. THE HOUSE WHERE ALVY GREW UP

Alvy's  mother sits at the old-fashioned dining-room table peeling carrots and 
talking as she looks off screen.

                    MOTHER 
          You always only saw the worst in people.  
          You never could get along with anyone at 
          school.  You were always outta step with the 
          world.  Even when you got famous, you still 
          distrusted the world.'

EXT. MANHATTAN STREET-DAY

A pretty Manhattan street with sidewalk trees, brownstones, a school; people 
mill about, some strolling and carrying bundles, others buried.  The screen 
shows the whole length of the sidewalk, a street, and part of the sidewalk 
beyond.  As the following scene ensues, two pedestrians, indistinguishable in 
the distance, come closer and closer toward the camera, recognizable, finally, 
as Alvy and his best friend, Rob, deep in conversation.  They eventually move 
past the camera and off screen.  Traffic noise is heard in the background.

                    ALVY 
          I distinctly heard it.  He muttered under 
          his breath, "Jew." 

                    ROB 
          You're crazy!

                    ALVY 
          No, I'm not.  We were walking off the 
          tennis court, and you know, he was there 
          and me and his wife, and he looked at her 
          and then they both looked at me, and under 
          his breath he said, "Jew."

                    ROB 
          Alvy, you're a total paranoid.

                    ALVY 
          Wh- How am I a paran-?  Well, I pick up on 
          those kind o' things.  You know, I was 
          having lunch with some guys from NBC, so 
          I said ... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" 
          and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" 
          Not, did you, didchoo eat?  Jew?  No, not 
          did you eat, but Jew eat?  Jew.  You get it?  
          Jew eat?

                    ROB 
          Ah, Max, you, uh ...

                    ALVY 
          Stop calling me Max.

                    ROB 
          Why, Max?  It's a good name for you.  Max, 
          you see conspiracies in everything.

                    ALVY 
          No, I don't!  You know, I was in a record 
          store.  Listen to this -so I know there's 
          this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and 
          he's lookin' at me in a funny way and 
          smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a 
          sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, 
          Wagner-so I know what he's really tryin' 
          to tell me very significantly Wagner. 

                    ROB 
          Right, Max.  California, Max.

                    ALVY 
          Ah.

                    ROB 
          Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.

                    ALVY 
          Forget it, Max.

                    ROB 
          -we move to sunny L.A. All of show business 
          is out there, Max.

                    ALVY
          No, I cannot.  You keep bringing it up, but 
          I don't wanna live in a city where the only 
          cultural advantage is that you can make a 
          right turn on a red light.

                    ROB
               (Checking his watch) 
          Right, Max, forget it.  Aren't you gonna be 
          late for meeting Annie?

                    ALVY 
          I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman.  
          I think I have a few minutes left.  Right?

EXT. BEEKMAN THEATER-DAY

Alvy stands in front of glass doors of theater, the ticket taker behind him 
just inside the glass doors.  The sounds of city traffic, car horns honking, 
can be heard while he looks around waiting for, Annie. A man in a black leather
jacket, walking past the theater, stops in front of, Alvy.  He looks at him, 
then moves away.  He stops a few steps farther and turns around to look at Alvy
again.  Alvy looks away, then back at the man.  The man continues to stare. 
Alvy scratches his head, looking for Annie and trying not to notice the man. 
The man, still staring, walks back to Alvy.

                    1ST MAN 
          Hey, you on television?

                    ALVY 
               (Nodding his head) 
          No. Yeah, once in a while.  You know, 
          like occasionally.

                    1ST MAN 
          What's your name?

                    ALVY 
               (Clearing his throat) 
          You wouldn't know it.  It doesn't matter.  
          What's the difference?

                    1ST MAN 
          You were on ... uh, the ... uh, the Johnny 
          Carson, right?  

                    ALVY 
          Once in a while, you know.  I mean, you 
          know, every now-

                    1ST MAN 
          What's your name?

Alvy  is getting more and more uneasy as the man talks; more and more people 
move through the doors of the theater.

                    ALVY 
               (Nervously) 
          I'm ... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford. 

                    1ST MAN 
               (Laughing) 
          Come on.

                    ALVY
          Alvy Singer. It was nice nice ... Thanks 
          very much ... for everything.

They shake hands and Alvy pats the man's arm.  The man in turn looks over his 
shoulder and motions to another man. All excited now, he points to Alvy and 
calls out. Alvy looks impatient.

                    1ST MAN 
          Hey!

                    2ND MAN 
               (Off screen) 
          What?

                    1ST MAN 
          This is Alvy Singer!

                    ALVY 
          Fellas ... you know-Jesus!  Come on!

                    1ST MAN 
               (Overlapping, ignoring Alvy) 
          This guy's on television!  Alvy
          Singer, right?  Am I right?

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping 1st man) 
          Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break.
          Jesus Christ!

                    1ST MAN 
               (Still ignoring Alvy's protestations) 
          This guy's on television.

                    ALVY 
          I need a large polo mallet!

                    2ND MAN 
               (Moving into the screen) 
          Who's on television?

                    1ST MAN
          This guy, on the Johnny Carson show.

                    ALVY 
               (Annoyed) 
          Fellas, what is this-a meeting o' the 
          teamsters?  You know.. .

                    2ND MAN 
               (Also ignoring Alvy) 
          What program?

                    1ST MAN 
               (Holding out a matchbook) 
          Can I have your autograph?

                    ALVY 
          You don't want my autograph.

                    1ST MAN 
               (Overlapping, Alvy's  speech) 
          Yeah, I do.  It's for my girl friend.  
          Make it out to Ralph.

                    ALVY 
               (Taking the matchbook and pen and 
               writing) 
          Your girl friend's name is Ralph?

                    1ST MAN 
          It's for my brudder. 
               (To passersby) 
          Alvy Singer!  Hey!  This is Alvy-

                    2ND MAN 
               (To Alvy, overlapping 1st man's speech) 
          You really Alvy Singer, the ... the 
          TV star?

Nodding his head yes, Alvy shoves 2nd man aside and moves to the curb of the 
sidewalk.  The two men follow, still talking over the traffic noise.

                    1ST MAN 
          -Singer!

                    2ND MAN 
          Alvy Singer over here!

A cab moves into the frame and stops by the curb.  Alvy moves over to it about 
to get in.

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping the two men and 
               stuttering) 
          I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas. 
               (As Alvy opens the cab door, the 
               two men still behind him, Annie 
               gets out) 
          Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of 
          the Panama Canal?

                    ANNIE 
               (Overlapping Alvy) 
          Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?  

Annie closes the cab door and she and Alvy move over to the ticket booth of 
the theater as they continue to talk.

                    ALVY 
          Bad mood?  I'm standing with the cast of 
          "The Godfather."

                    ANNIE 
          You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.

                    ALVY 
          Deal!  I'm dealing with two guys named 
          Cheech!

                    ANNIE 
          Okay. 
               (They move into the ticket line, 
               still talking.  A billboard next to 
               them reads "INGMAR BERGMAN'S 'FACE 
               TO FACE ,'LIV ULLMANN") 
          Please, I have a headache, all right?

                    ALVY 
          Hey, you are in a bad mood.  You-you-
          you must be getting your period.

                    ANNIE 
          I'm not getting my period.  Jesus, every 
          time anything out of the ordinary happens, 
          you think that I'm getting my period!

They move over to the ticket counter, people in front of them buying tickets 
and walking off screen.

                    ALVY 
               (Gesturing) 
          A li-little louder.  I think one of them 
          may have missed it! 
               (To the ticket clerk) 
          H'm, has the picture started yet?

                    TICKET CLERK 
          It started two minutes ago.

                    ALVY 
               (Hitting his hand on the counter) 
          That's it!  Forget it!  I-I can't go in.

                    ANNIE 
          Two minutes, Alvy.

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping Annie)
          No, I'm sorry, I can't do it.  We-we've 
          blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I 
          can't go in in the middle.

                    ANNIE 
          In the middle? 
               (Alvy nods his head yes and let's
               out an exasperated sigh) 
          We'll only miss the titles.  They're in 
          Swedish.

                    ALVY 
          You wanna get coffee for two hours or 
          something?  We'll go next-

                    ANNIE 
          Two hours?  No, u-uh, I'm going in.  
          I'm going in. 

She moves past the ticket clerk.

                    ALVY 
               (Waving to Annie) 
          Go ahead.  Good-bye. 

Annie moves back to Alvy and takes his arm.

                    ANNIE 
          Look, while we're talking we could be 
          inside, you know that?

                    ALVY 
               (Watching people with tickets move 
               past them) 
          Hey, can we not stand here and argue in 
          front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.

                    ANNIE 
          Alright.  All right, all right, so whatta 
          you wanna do?

                    ALVY 
          I don't know now.  You-you wanna go to 
          another movie? 
               (Annie nods her head and shrugs 
               her shoulders disgustedly as Alvy, 
               gesturing with his band, looks at 
               her) 
          So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, come on, we've seen it.  I'm not in 
          the mood to see a four-hour documentary 
          on Nazis.

                    ALVY 
          Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't ... I-I-I've 
          gotta see a picture exactly from the start 
          to the finish, 'cause-'cause I'm anal.

                    ANNIE
               (Laughing now) 
          H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.

INT. THEATER LOBBY.

A lined-up crowd of ticket holders waiting to get into the theater, Alvy and 
Annie among them.  A bum of indistinct chatter can be heard through the ensuing
scene.

                    MAN IN LINE 
               (Loudly to his companion right 
               behind Alvy and Annie) 
          We saw the Fellini film last Tuesday.  
          It is not one of his best.  It lacks a 
          cohesive structure.  You know, you get 
          the feeling that he's not absolutely sure 
          what it is he wants to say.  'Course, I've 
          always felt he was essentially a-a technical 
          film maker.  Granted, La Strada was a great 
          film.  Great in its use of negative energy 
          more than anything else.  But that simple 
          cohesive core ... 

Alvy, reacting to the man's loud monologue, starts to get annoyed, while Annie 
begins to read her newspaper.

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping the man's speech) 
          I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.

                    ANNIE 
               (Reading) 
          Well, stop listening to him.

                    MAN IN LINE 
               (Overlapping Alvy and Annie) 
          You know, it must need to have had its 
          leading from one thought to another.  
          You know what I'm talking about?

                    ALVY 
               (Sighing) 
          He's screaming his opinions in my ear.

                    MAN IN LINE 
          Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or 
          Satyricon, I found it incredibly ... 
          indulgent.  You know, he really is.  He's 
          one of the most indulgent film makers.  He 
          really is-

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping) 
          Key word here is "indulgent."

                    MAN IN LINE 
               (Overlapping) 
          -without getting ... well, let's put it 
          this way ...

                    ALVY 
               (To Annie, who is still reading, 
               overlapping the man in line who is 
               still talking) 
          What are you depressed about?

                    ANNIE 
          I missed my therapy.  I overslept.

                    ALVY  
          How can you possibly oversleep?

                    ANNIE 
          The alarm clock.

                    ALVY 
               (Gasping) 
          You know what a hostile gesture that is 
          to me?

                    ANNIE 
          I know-because of our sexual problem, 
          right?

                    ALVY 
          Hey, you ... everybody in line at the 
          New Yorker has to know our rate of 
          intercourse?

                    MAN IN LINE
          - It's like Samuel Beckett, you know-
          I admire the technique but he doesn't ... 
          he doesn't hit me on a gut level.

                    ALVY 
               (To Annie) 
          I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.

The man in line continues his speech all the while Alvy and Annie talk.

                    ANNIE 
          Stop it, Alvy!

                    ALVY 
               (Wringing his hands) 
          Well, he's spitting on my neck!  You know, 
          he's spitting on my neck when he talks.

                    MAN IN LINE 
          And then, the most important thing of all 
          is a comedian's vision.

                    ANNIE 
          And you know something else?  You know, 
          you're so egocentric that if I miss my 
          therapy you can think of it in terms of 
          how it affects you!

                    MAN IN LINE 
               (Lighting a cigarette while he talks) 
          Gal gun-shy is what it is.

                    ALVY
               (Reacting again to the man in line) 
          Probably on their first date, right?

                    MAN IN LINE 
               (Still going on) 
          It's a narrow view.

                    ALVY
          Probably met by answering an ad in the 
          New York Review of Books.  "Thirtyish 
          academic wishes to meet woman who's 
          interested in Mozart, James Joyce and 
          sodomy." 
               (He sighs; then to Annie) 
          Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?

                    ANNIE 
          Oh!

                    ALVY  
          I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal 
          for a guy raised in Brooklyn.

                    ANNIE 
          Okay, I'm very sorry.  My sexual problem!  
          Okay, my sexual problem!  Huh?

The man in front of them turns to look at them, then looks away.

                    ALVY 
          I never read that.  That was-that was 
          Henry James, right?  Novel, uh, the 
          sequel to Turn of the Screw?  My Sexual ...

                    MAN IN LINE 
               (Even louder now) 
          It's the influence of television.  Yeah, 
          now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms 
          of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, 
          you understand?  A hot medium ... as opposed 
          to a ...

                    ALVY 
               (More and more aggravated) 
          What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' 
          horse manure.

                    MAN IN LINE     
          ... as opposed to a print ...

Alvy steps forward, waving his hands in frustration, and stands facing the 
camera.

                    ALVY 
               (Sighing and addressing the audience) 
          What do you do when you get stuck in a movie 
          line with a guy like this behind you?  I mean, 
          it's just maddening!

The man in line moves toward Alvy.  Both address the audience now.

                    MAN IN LINE 
          Wait a minute, why can't I give my opinion?  
          It's a free country!

                    ALVY 
          I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta 
          give it so loud?  I mean, aren't you ashamed 
          to pontificate like that?  And-and the funny 
          part of it is, M-Marshall McLuhan, you don't
          know anything about Marshall McLuhan's...work!

                    MAN IN LINE 
               (Overlapping) 
          Wait a minute!  Really?  Really?  I happen to 
          teach a class at Columbia called "TV Media 
          and Culture"!  So I think that my insights 
          into Mr. McLuhan-well, have a great deal of 
          validity.

                    ALVY 
          Oh, do yuh?

                    MAN IN LINE 
          Yes.

                    ALVY 
          Well, that's funny, because I happen to 
          have Mr. McLuhan right here.  So ... so, 
          here, just let me-I mean, all right.  Come 
          over here ... a second.

Alvy gestures to the camera which follows him and the man in line to the back 
of the crowded lobby.  He moves over to a large stand-up movie poster and 
pulls Marshall McLuban from behind the poster.

                    MAN IN LINE 
          Oh.

                    ALVY 
               (To McLuban) 
          Tell him.

                    MCLUHAN 
               (To the man in line) 
          I hear-I heard what you were saying.  
          You-you know nothing of my work.  You 
          mean my whole fallacy is wrong.  How you 
          ever got to teach a course in anything is 
          totally amazing.

                    ALVY 
               (To the camera) 
          Boy, if life were only like this!

          June fourteenth, nineteen forty, the 
          German army occupies Paris.  All over 
          the country, people are desperate for 
          every available scrap of news.

INT. BEDROOM-NIGHT 

Annie is sitting up in bed reading.

                    ALVY 
               (Off screen) 
          Boy, those guys in the French Resistance 
          were really brave, you know?  Got to listen 
          to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.

                    ANNIE 
          M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself 
          how I'd stand up under torture.

                    ALVY 
               (Off screen) 
          You?  You kiddin'? 
               (He moves into the frame, lying across 
               the bed to touch, Annie, who makes a 
               face) 
          If the Gestapo would take away your 
          Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em 
          everything.

                    ANNIE 
          That movie makes me feel guilty.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.

He starts kissing Annie's arm.  She gets annoyed and continues to read.

                    ANNIE 
          Alvy, I ...

                    ALVY 
          What-what-what-what's the matter?

                    ANNIE 
          I-you know, I don't wanna.

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping Annie, reacting) 
          What-what-I don't ... It's not natural!  
          We're sleeping in a bed together.  You 
          know, it's been a long time.

                    ANNIE 
          I know, well, it's just that-you know, I 
          mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, 
          so I have to rest my voice.

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping Annie again) 
          It's always some kind of an excuse.  It's- 
          You know, you used to think that I was 
          very sexy.  What ... When we first started 
          going out, we had sex constantly ... We're-
          we're probably listed in the Guinness Book 
          of World Records.

                    ANNIE 
               (Patting Alvy's band solicitously) 
          I know.  Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll 
          pass, it's just that I'm going through a 
          phase, that's all.

                    ALVY 
          M'm.

                    ANNIE 
          I mean, you've been married before, you 
          know how things can get.  You were very 
          hot for Allison at first.

                                        CUT TO:


INT. BACK STAGE OF AUDITORIUM - NIGHT.

Allison, clipboard in band, walks about the wings, stopping to talk to various 
people.  Musicians, performers and technicians mill about, busy with activity. 
Allison wears a large "ADLAI" button, as do the people around her.  The sounds 
of a comedian on the stage of the auditorium can be heard, occasionally, 
interrupted by chatter and applause from the off screen audience.  Allison 
stops to talk to two women; they, too, wear "ADLAI" buttons.

                    ALLISON 
               (Looking down at the clipboard) 
          Ma'am, you're on right after this man ... 
          about twenty minutes, something like that.

                    WOMAN 
          Oh, thank you.

Alvy moves into the frame behind Allison.  He taps her on the shoulder; she 
turns to face him.

                    ALVY 
               (Coughing) 
          Excuse ... excuse me, when do I go on?

                    ALLISON 
               (Looking down at the clipboard) 
          Who are you?

                    ALVY
          Alvy ... Alvy Singer.  I'm a comedian.

                    ALLISON 
          Oh, comedian.  Yes.  Oh, uh ... you're 
          on next.

                    ALVY 
               (Rubbing his hands together 
               nervously) 
          What do you mean, next?

                    ALLISON 
               (Laughing) 
          Uh ... I mean you're on right after 
          this act.

                    ALVY 
               (Gesturing) 
          No, it can't be, because he's a comic.

                    ALLISON 
          Yes.

                    ALVY 
          So what are you telling me, you're 
          putting on two comics in a row?

                    ALLISON 
          Why not?

                    ALVY  
          No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't 
          ... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.

                    ALLISON 
          It's okay.

                    ALVY 
          No, because they're-they're laughing, so 
               (He starts laughing nervously) 
          I-I-I'd rather not.  If you don't mind, 
          I prefer-

                    ALLISON 
               (Overlapping) 
          Will you relax, please?  They're gonna 
          love you, I know.

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping) 
          I prefer not to, because ... look, 
          they're laughing at him.  See, so what 
          are yuh telling me-

They move closer to the stage, looking out from the wings.

                    ALLISON 
               (Overlapping) 
          Yes.

                    ALVY 
(Overlapping) 
          -that I've got to ... ah ... ah ... 
          They're gonna laugh at him for a couple 
          minutes, then I gotta go out there, I 
          gotta ... get laughs, too.  How much can 
          they laugh? 
               (Off screen) 
          They-they they're laughed out.

                    ALLISON 
               (Off screen) 
          Do you feel all right?

As Allison and Alvy look out at the stage, the camera cuts to their point of 
view: a comedian standing at a podium in front of huge waving pictures of Adlai
Stevenson.  The audience, laughing and clapping, sits at round tables in 
clusters around the room.

The camera moves back to Allison and Alvy watching the stage.  Alvy is swinging
his hands nervously.

                    COMEDIAN 
               (Off screen, onstage) 
          You know ...

Alvy starts looking Allison up and down; people in the background mill about.

                    ALVY 
               (Above the chatter around him) 
          Look, what's your-what's your name?

                    COMEDIAN 
               (Off screen)  
          ... General Eisenhower is not ...

                    ALLISON 
               (Looking out at the stage) 
          Allison.

                    ALVY   
          Yeah?  Allison what?

                    ALLISON 
               (Still looking off screen) 
          Portchnik.

                    COMEDIAN     
          ... a group from the ...

                    ALVY
               (Coughing) 
          Thank you. I-I don't know why they would 
          have me at this kind of rally 'cause ... 
               (He clears his throat) 
          Excuse me, I'm not essentially a political 
          comedian at all.

The audience starts to laugh.

                    ALVY 
          I ... interestingly had, uh, dated ... 
          a woman in the Eisenhower Administration 
          ... briefly ... and, uh, it was ironic to 
          me 'cause, uh . . . tsch . . . 'cause I 
          was trying to, u-u-uh, do to her what 
          Eisenhower has been doing to the country 
          for the last eight years. 

The audience is with him, laughing, as Allison continues to watch offstage.

INT. APARTMENT BEDROOM.

Allison and, Alvy are on the bed, kissing.  There are books all over the room; 
a fireplace, unlit, along one of the walls. Alvy suddenly breaks away and sits 
on the edge of the bed. Allison looks at him.

                    ALVY  
          H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with 
          this, because it-I can't get it off my 
          mind, Allison ... it's obsessing me!

                    ALLISON 
          Well, I'm getting tired of it.  I need 
          your attention.

Alvy gets up from the bed and starts walking restlessly around the room, 
gesturing with his hands.

                    ALVY 
          It-but it-it ... doesn't make any sense.  
          He drove past the book depository and the 
          police said conclusively that it was an 
          exit wound.  So-how is it possible for 
          Oswald to have fired from two angles at 
          once?  It doesn't make sense.

                    ALLISON 
          Alvy.

Alvy, stopping for a moment at the fireplace mantel, sighs.  He then snaps his 
fingers and starts walking again.

                    ALVY 
          I'll tell you this!  He was not marksman 
          enough to hit a moving target at that 
          range.  But ... 
               (Clears his throat) 
          if there was a second assassin ... it- 
          That's it!

Alvy stops at the music stand with open sheet music on it as Allison gets up 
from the bed and retrieves a pack of cigarettes from a bookshelf.

                    ALLISON 
          We've been through this.

                    ALVY 
          If they-they recovered the shells from 
          that rifle.

                    ALLISON 
               (Moving back to the bed and 
               lighting a cigarette) 
          Okay.  All right, so whatta yuh saying, 
          now?  That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren 
          Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?

                    ALVY 
          Well, why not?

                    ALLISON 
          Yeah, Earl Warren?

                    ALVY 
               (Moving toward the bed) 
          Hey ... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.

                    ALLISON 
          Lyndon Johnson?

                    ALVY 
               (Propping one knee on the bed 
               and gesturing) 
          L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a 
          politician.  You know the ethics those 
          guys have?  It's like-uh, a notch 
          underneath child molester.

                    ALLISON 
          Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?

                    ALVY 
               (Nodding his head) 
          Tsch.

                    ALLISON 
          The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar 
          Hoover and oil companies and the 
          Pentagon and the men's-room attendant 
          at the White House?

Alvy touches Allison's shoulder, then gets up from the bed and starts walking 
again.

                    ALVY 
          I-I-I-I would leave out the men's-room 
          attendant.

                    ALLISON 
          You're using this conspiracy theory as 
          an excuse to avoid sex with me.

                    ALVY 
          Oh, my God! 
               (Then, to the camera) 
          She's right!  Why did I turn off Allison 
          Portchnik?  She was-she was beautiful.  She 
          was willing.  She was real ... intelligent. 
               (Sighing) 
          Is it the old Groucho Marx joke?  That-that 
          I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that 
          would have someone like me for a member?

EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY

Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard over the wind-browned exterior of a beach 
house in the Hamptons. As they continue to talk, the camera moves inside the 
house. Alvy is picking up chairs, trying to get at the group of lobsters 
crawling on the floor.  Dishes are stacked up in a drying rack, and bags of 
groceries sit on the counter.  There's a table and chairs near the refrigerator. 

                    ANNIE 
          Alvy, now don't panic.  Please.

                    ALVY 
          Look, I told you it was a ... mistake 
          to ever bring a live thing in the house.

                    ANNIE
          Stop it!  Don't ... don't do that!  There.
 
The lobsters continue to crawl on the floor.  Annie, bolding out a wooden 
paddle, tries to shove them onto it.

                    ALVY 
          Well, maybe we should just call the police.  
          Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.

                    ANNIE 
          Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for 
          God's sake. 

                    ALVY 
          If they're only babies, then you pick 
          'em up.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, all right.  All right!  It's all 
          right.  Here.

She drops the paddle and picks up one of the lobsters by the tail.  Laughing, 
she shoves it at Alvy who jerks backward, squeamishly.

                    ALVY 
          Don't give it to me.  Don't!

                    ANNIE 
               (Hysterically) 
          Oooh!  Here!  Here!

                    ALVY 
               (Pointing) 
          Look!  Look, one crawled behind the 
          refrigerator.  It'll turn up in our bed 
          at night. 
               (They move over to the refrigerator; 
               Alvy moves as close to the wall as 
               possible as Annie, covering her mouth 
               and laughing hysterically, teasingly 
               dangles a lobster in front of him) 
          Will you get outta here with that thing?  
          Jesus!

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing, to the lobster) 
          Get him!

                    ALVY 
               (Laughing) 
          Talk to him.  You speak shellfish! 
               (He moves over to the stove and 
               takes the lid of a large steamer 
               filled with boiling water) 
          Hey, look ... put it in the pot.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          I can't!  I can't put him in the pot.  I 
          can't put a live thing in hot water.

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping) 
          Gimme!  Gimme!  Let me do it!  What-what's 
          he think we're gonna do, take him to the 
          movies?

Annie hands the lobster to Alvy as he takes it very carefully and drops it 
gingerly into the pot and puts the cover back on.

                    ANNIE 
               (Overlapping Alvy and making sounds) 
          Oh, God!  Here yuh go!  Oh, good, now 
          he'll think- 
               (She screams) 
          Aaaah!  Okay.

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping Annie) 
          Okay, it's in.  It's definitely in the pot!

                    ANNIE 
          All right.  All right.  All right.

She moves hurriedly across the kitchen and picks up another lobster.  Smiling, 
she places it on the counter as Alvy stands beside the refrigerator trying to 
push it from the wall.

                    ALVY 
          Annie, there's a big lobster behind 
          the refrigerator.  I can't get it out.  
          This thing's heavy.  Maybe if I put a 
          little dish of butter sauce here with a 
          nutcracker, it will run out the other 
          side, you know what I mean?

                    ANNIE 
               (Overlapping) 
          Yeah.  I'm gonna get my ... I'm gonna 
          get my camera.

                    ALVY 
          You know, I-I think ... if I could pry 
          this door off ... We shoulda gotten steaks 
          'cause they don't have legs.  They don't 
          run around.

Annie rushes out of the room to get her camera as Alvy picks up the paddle. 
Trying to get at the lobsters, he ends up knocking over dishes and hitting the 
chandelier.  Holding the paddle, he finally leans back against the sink.  
Annie, standing in the doorway, starts taking pictures of him.

                    ANNIE 
          Great!  Great! 
               (Screaming) 
          Goddammit! 
               (Screaming) 
          Ooooh!  These are ... p-p-p-pick this 
          lobster up.  Hold it, please!

                    ALVY 
          All right!  All right!  All right!  All 
          right!  Whatta yuh mean?  Are yuh gonna 
          take pictures now?

                    ANNIE 
          It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll 
          be wonderful ... Ooooh, lovely!

                    ALVY 
               (Picking up the lobster Annie 
               placed on the counter earlier) 
          All right, here!  Oh, God, it's disgusting!

Alvy drops the lobster back down on the counter, sticking out his tongue and 
making a face.

                    ANNIE 
          Don't be a jerk.  One more, Alvy, please, 
          one more picture. 
               (Reluctantly Alvy picks up the 
               lobster again as Annie takes 
               another picture) 
          Oh, oh, good, good!

EXT. OCEAN FRONT-DUSK.

The camera pans Annie and Alvy as they walk along the shore.

                    ALVY 
          So, so-well, here's what I wanna know.  
          W-what ... 
               (He clears his throat) 
          Am I your first big romance?

                    ANNIE 
          Oh ... no, no, no, no, uh, uh.  No.

                    ALVY 
          Well, then, w-who was?

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, 
          from Chippewa Falls High School. 

CUT TO:

FLASHBACK OF DENNIS LEANING AGAINST A CAR - NIGHT

Behind him is a movie theater with "MARILYN MONROE, 'MISFITS' " on the marquee.
He looks at his watch as the younger Annie, in a beehive hairdo, moves into the
frame.  They kiss quickly and look at each other, smiling.

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
               (Off screen) 
          Dennis-right, uh, uh ... local kid 
          probably, would meetcha in front of the 
          movie house on Saturday night.

                    ANNIE'S VOICE 
          Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked 
          like then.

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
               (Off screen, laughing) 
          Oh, I can imagine.  P-p-probably the 
          wife of an astronaut.

                    ANNIE'S VOICE 
          Then there was Jerry, the actor.

FLASHBACK OF BRICK-WALLED APARTMENT - NIGHT

The younger, Annie and Jerry lean against the wall. Jerry is running his band 
down Annie's bare arm. Annie and Alvy walk into the room, observing the younger
Annie, in jeans and T-shirt, with Jerry.

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
               (Laughing) 
          Look at you, you-you,-re such a clown.

                    ANNIE'S VOICE 
          I look pretty.

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
          Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but 
          that guy with you ...

                    JERRY 
          Acting is like an exploration of the soul. 
          I-it's very religious.  Uh, like, uh, a 
          kind of liberating consciousness.  It's 
          like a visual poem.

                    ALVY 
               (Laughing) 
          Is he kidding with that crap?

                    YOUNGER ANNIE
               (Laughing) 
          Oh, right.  Right, yeah, I think I 
          know exactly what you mean, when you 
          say "religious."

                    ALVY 
               (Incredulous, to Annie) 
          You do?

                    ANNIE 
               (Still watching) 
          Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.

                    ALVY 
          Hey, that was last year.

                    JERRY 
          It's like when I think of dying.  You 
          know how I would like to die?

                    YOUNGER ANNIE 
          No, how?

                    JERRY 
          I'd like to get torn apart by wild animals.

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
          Heavy!  Eaten by some squirrels.

                    ANNIE'S VOICE 
          Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, 
          and look at him, he's neat-looking and he 
          was emotional ... Y-hey, I don't think you 
          like emotion too much.

Jerry stops rubbing the younger Annie's arm and slides down to the floor as 
she raises her foot toward his chest.

                    JERRY 
          Touch my heart ... with your foot. 

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
          I-I may throw up!

EXTERIOR.  BEACH-DUSK

It's now sunset, the water reflecting the last light.  The camera moves over 
the scene.  The off screen voices of Alvy and Annie are heard as they walk, the
camera always one step ahead of them.

                    ANNIE 
          He was creepy.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I 
          came along. 

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Oh, really?  Well, la-de-da!

                    ALVY 
          La-de-da.  If I-if anyone had ever told 
          me that I would be taking out a girl who 
          used expressions like "la-de-da" . . .

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, that's right.  That you really like 
          those New York girls. 

                    ALVY 
          Well, no ... not just, not only.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, I'd say so.  You married-

INT. NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT-NIGHT

A cocktail party is in progress, the rooms crowded with guests as Alvy and 
Robin make their way through the people.  A waiter, carrying a tray, walks 
past them.  Alvy reaches out to pick up a glass; Robin reaches over and picks 
it of the tray first.  There is much low-key chatter in the background.

                    ANNIE 
               (Off screen) 
          -two of them.

                    ROBIN 
          There's Henry Drucker.  He has a chair 
          in history at Princeton.  Oh, the short 
          man is Hershel Kaminsky.  He has a chair 
          in philosophy at Cornell.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, two more chairs and they got a 
          dining-room set.

                    ROBIN 
          Why are you so hostile?

                    ALVY 
               (Sighing) 
          'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on 
          television.

                    ROBIN 
               (Squinting) 
          Is that Paul Goodman?  No. And be nice 
          to the host because he's publishing my 
          book.  Hi, Doug!  Douglas Wyatt.  
          "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of-the-Heart."

They move through the rooms, Robin holding a drink in one hand, her arm draped 
in Alvy's; the crowd mills around them.

                    ALVY 
               (Taking Robin's hand) 
          I'm so tired of spending evenings making 
          fake insights with people who work for 
          Dysentery.

                    ROBIN 
          Commentary.

                    ALVY 
          Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and 
          Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.

                    ROBIN 
          No jokes-these are friends, okay?

INT. BEDROOM

Alvy sits on the foot of the bed watching the Knicks game on television.

                    TV ANNOUNCER 
               (Off screen) 
          Cleveland Cavaliers losing to the New 
          York Knicks.

Robin enters the room, slamming the door.

                    ROBIN 
          Here you are.  There's people out there.

                    ALVY 
          Hey, you wouldn't believe this.  Two 
          minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen 
          points, and now ... 
               (Clears his throat) 
          they're ahead two points.

                    ROBIN 
          Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group 
          of pituitary cases trying to stuff the 
          ball through a hoop?

                    ALVY 
               (Looking at Robin) 
          What's fascinating is that it's physical.  
          You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, 
          they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant 
          and have no idea what's going on.  But on the 
          other hand ... 
               (Clears his throat) 
          the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.

Alvy reaches over, pulls Robin down onto the bed.  He kisses her and moves 
farther up on the bed.

                    ROBIN 
          Stop acting out.

She sits on the edge of the bed, looking down at the sprawled-out Alvy.

                    ALVY 
          No, it'll be great!  It'll be great, 
          be-because all those Ph.D.'s are in 
          there, you know, like ... discussing 
          models of alienation and we'll be in 
          here quietly humping.

He pulls Robin toward him, caressing her as she pulls herself away.

                    ROBIN 
          Alvy, don't!  You're using sex to 
          express hostility.

                    ALVY 
          "'Why-why do you always r-reduce my 
          animal urges to psychoanalytic categories?' 
               (Clears his throat) 
          he said as he removed her brassiere..."

                    ROBIN 
               (Pulling away again) 
          There are people out there from The New 
          Yorker magazine.  My God!  What would they 
          think?

She gets up and fixes the zipper on her dress.  She turns and moves toward the 
door.

INT. APARTMENT-NIGHT

Robin and Alvy are in bed.  The room is in darkness.  Outside, a siren starts 
blaring.

                    ROBIN 
          Oh, I'm sorry!

                    ALVY 
          Don't get upset!

                    ROBIN 
          Dammit!  I was so close.

She flips on the overhead lamp and turns on her side.  Alvy turns to her.

                    ALVY 
               (Gesturing) 
          Jesus, last night it was some guy honking 
          his car horn.  I mean, the city can't 
          close down.  You know, what-whatta yuh 
          gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the 
          airport, too?  No more flights so we can 
          have sex?

                    ROBIN 
               (Reaching over for her eyeglasses 
               on the night table) 
          I'm too tense.  I need a Valium.  My 
          analyst says I should live in the country 
          and not in New York.

                    ALVY 
          Well, I can't li- We can't have this 
          discussion all the time.  The country 
          makes me nervous.  There's ... You got 
          crickets and it-it's quiet ... there's 
          no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, 
          there's the screens with the dead moths 
          behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the 
          Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and 
          Terry-

                    ROBIN 
               (Interrupting) 
          Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm 
          too tense.  Where's the goddamn Valium?

She fumbles about the floor for the Valium, then back on the bed.

                    ALVY 
          Hey, come on, it's quiet now.  We can-we 
          can start again.

                    ROBIN 
          I can't.

                    ALVY
          What-

                    ROBIN
          My head is throbbing.

                    ALVY
          Oh, you got a headache!

                    ROBIN
          I have a headache.

                    ALVY
          Bad?

                    ROBIN
          Oswald and ghosts.

                    ALVY
          Jesus!

He begins to get out of bed.

                    ROBIN 
          Where are you going?

                    ALVY 
          Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a 
          series of cold showers.

EXT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM OF THE TENNIS CLUB.

Rob and Alvy, carrying tennis rackets, come through the door of the locker 
room to the lobby.  They are dressed in tennis whites.  They walk toward the 
indoor court.

                    ROB
                Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to 
          the showers-

                    ALVY
          Right, right, so g-get back to what we 
          were discussing, the failure of the 
          country to get behind New York City is-is 
          anti-Semitism.

                    ROB 
          Max, the city is terribly worried.

                    ALVY 
          But the- I'm not discussing politics or 
          economics.  This is foreskin.

                    ROB 
          No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient 
          out.  Every time some group disagrees with 
          you it's because of anti-Semitism.

                    ALVY 
          Don't you see?  The rest of the country looks 
          upon New York like we're-we're left-wing 
          Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers.  
          I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I 
          live here.

                    ROB 
          Max, if we lived in California, we could 
          play outdoors every day, in the sun.

                    ALVY 
          Sun is bad for yuh.  Everything our parents 
          said was good is bad.  Sun, milk, red meat, 
          college ...

INT. TENNIS COURT

Annie and Janet, in tennis whites, stand on the court holding tennis rackets 
and balls.  They are chattering and giggling.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          I know, but ooh- here he comes.  Okay. 

Rob and Alvy enter the court and walk over to the two women.  Rob kisses Janet 
and makes introduction.

                    ROB 
          You know Alvy?

                    JANET 
          Oh, hi, Alvy.

                    ANNIE 
               (To Rob) 
          How are yuh?

                    ROB 
               (To Alvy) 
          You know Annie?

                    JANET 
          I'm sorry.  This is Annie Hall.

                    ALVY 
          Hi.

                    ANNIE 
          Hi.

Annie and Alvy shake hands.

                    JANET 
               (Laughing) 
          Alvy.

                    ROB 
               (Eager to begin) 
          Who's playing who here?  Alvy Well, uh ... 
          you and me against them?

                    ANNIE 
               (Overlapping Alvy) 
          Well ... so ... I can't play too good, 
          you know.

                    JANET 
               (Laughing) 
          I've had four lessons!

The group, laughing and chatting, divide up-Rob and Annie moving to the other 
side of the net, Alvy and Janet standing where they are.  They start to play 
mixed doubles, each taking turns and playing well. At one point in the game, 
Annie starts to talk to Rob, then turns and sees a ball heading toward her.

                    ALVY  
               (Hitting the halt back) 
          Holy gods!

INT. LOBBY

Alvy, dressed, puts things into a gym bag.  One knee is on the bench and his 
back is turned from the entrance. Annie walks toward the entrance door dressed 
in street clothes and carrying her tennis bag over her shoulder.  Seeing Alvy,
she stops and turns.

                    ANNIE 
          Hi.  Hi, hi.

                    ALVY 
               (Looking over his shoulder) 
          Hi.  Oh, hi.  Hi.

                    ANNIE 
               (Hands clasped in front of her, 
               smiling) 
          Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly 
          toward the door.

                    ALVY 
               (Clearing his throat) 
          You-you play ... very well.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, yeah?  So do you.  Oh, God, whatta-
               (Making sounds and laughing) 
          whatta dumb thing to say, right?  I mean, 
          you say it, "You play well," and right 
          away ... I have to say well.  Oh, oh ... 
          God, Annie. 
               (She gestures with her hand) 
          Well ... oh, well ... la-de-da, la-de-da, 
          la-la.

She turns around and moves toward the door.

                    ALVY 
               (Still looking over his shoulder) 
          Uh ... you-you wanna lift?

                    ANNIE 
               (Turning and aiming her thumb over 
               her shoulder) 
          Oh, why-uh ... y-y-you gotta car?

                    ALVY 
          No, um ... I was gonna take a cab.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Oh, no, I have a car.

                    ALVY 
          You have a car? 
               (Annie smiles, hands folded in 
               front of her) 
          So ... 
               (Clears his throat) 
          I don't understand why ... if you have a 
          car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do 
          you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?

                    ANNIE 
          I don't ... 
               (Laughing) 
          I don't ... Geez, I don't know, I've ... 
          I wa- This ... yeah, I got this VW out 
          there ... 
               (Laughing and gesturing toward 
               the door) 
          What a jerk, yeah.  Would you like a lift?

                    ALVY 
               (Zipping up his bag) 
          Sure.  W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?

                    ANNIE 
          Me?  Oh, downtown!

                    ALVY 
          Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.

                    ALVY 
          Uh, well, you just said you were going 
          downtown.

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah, well, I'm, but I ...

Alvy picks up his bag and moves toward the door. As he turns his bag around, 
the handle of the tennis racket bits Annie between the legs.

                    ALVY 
               (Laughing) 
          So sorry.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          I mean, I can go uptown, too.  I live 
          uptown, but ... uh, what the hell, I mean, 
          it'd be nice having company, you know 
          I mean, I hate driving alone.

                    ALVY 
               (Making sounds) 
          Yeah.

They walk out the door.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET- DAY

Alvy and Annie in the VW as Annie speeds down a city street near the East River.

                    ALVY 
          So, how long do you know Janet?  Where 
          do you know her from?

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Oh, I'm in her acting class.

                    ALVY 
          Oh - you're an actress.

                    ANNIE 
          Well, I do commercials, sort of ...

She zooms down the wrong lane, cars swerving out of her way.  A horn blows.

                    ALVY 
          I, uh ... well, you're not from New 
          York, right?

                    ANNIE 
          No, Chippewa Falls.

                    ALVY 
          Right! 
               (A pause) 
          Where?

                    ANNIE 
          Wisconsin.

                    ALVY 
               (Finally reacting) 
          Uh, you're driving a-

                    ANNIE 
          Uh, don't worry, I'm a very- 
               (A car moves closer to the VW, 
               almost on top of it in the wrong 
               direction.  Annie swerves away at 
               the very last minute)
          -a very good driver. 
               (Alvy rubs his head nervously, 
               staring out the window as Annie 
               speeds along) 
          So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?

Annie looks down beside her, searching for the gum.

                    ALVY
          No, no thanks.  Hey, don't-

                    ANNIE
          Well, where is it?  I-

                    ALVY 
          No, no, no, no, you just ... just watch 
          the road.  I'll get it-

                    ANNIE 
          Okay.

They both fumble around in her pocketbook.  Alvy looks up to see the entire 
front of a truck in Annie's windshield.  She swerves just in time.

                    ALVY 
          -for yuh.

                    ANNIE 
          Okay, that's good.

Alvy continues to look for the gum while Annie zooms down the city streets.

                    ANNIE 
          All right.

                    ALVY 
          I'll getcha a piece.

                    ANNIE     
          Yeah ... so, listen-you drive?

                    ALVY
          Do I drive?  Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta 
          problem with driving.

                    ANNIE     
          Oh, you do?

                    ALVY     
          Yeah.  I got, uh, I got a license but I 
          have too much hostility.

                    ANNIE     
          Oh, right.

                    ALVY     
          Nice car.

                    ANNIE 
               (A bit rapidly)   
          Huh?

                    ALVY 
          You keep it nice. 
               (He pulls a half-eaten sandwich 
               out of her bag) 
          Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?

                    ANNIE 
          Huh?  Oh, yeah.

EXT. STREET-DAY

Cars are parked on both sides of the street as the VW rounds the corner.

                    ANNIE 
          I live over here.  Oh, my God!  Look!  
          There's a parking space!  

With brakes squealing, Annie turns the VW sharply into the parking spot.  
Annie and Alvy get out, Alvy looking over his shoulder as he leaves the car.

                    ALVY   
          That's okay, you ... we-we can walk to 
          the curb from here.

                    ANNIE 
          Don't be funny.

                    ALVY   
          You want your tennis stuff?

                    ANNIE 
          Huh?  Oh ... yeah.

                    ALVY   
          You want your gear?  Here you go.

Alvy reaches into the back of the car and takes out tennis equipment.  He 
hands her her things.  People pass by on the street.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Yeah, thanks.  Thanks a lot.  Well...

                    ALVY 
               (Sighing) 
          Well, thanks, thank you.  You-you're 
          a wonderful tennis player.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Oh.

Alvy shakes hands with Annie.

                    ALVY 
          You're the worst driver I've ever seen 
          in my life . . . that's including any place 
          ... the worst ... Europe, United ... any 
          place ... Asia.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Yeah.

                    ALVY 
          And I love what you're wearin'.

Alvy touches the tie Annie is wearing around her neck.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, you do?  Yeah?  Oh, well, it's uh 
          ... this is, uh ... this tie is a present, 
          from Grammy Hall.

Annie flips the bottom of the tie.

                    ALVY  
          Who?  Grammy?  Grammy Hall?

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing and nodding her head) 
          Yeah, my grammy.

                    ALVY 
          You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you 
          do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Yeah, I know.

                    ALVY 
          Your grammy!

                    ANNIE 
          I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?

                    ALVY 
          Jesus, my-my grammy ... n-never gave 
          gifts, you know.  She-she was     too busy 
          getting raped by Cossacks.

                    ANNIE
               (Laughing) 
          Well ...

                    ALVY     
          Well ... thank you again.

                    ANNIE     
          Oh, yeah, yeah.

                    ALVY     
          I'll see yuh.

                    ANNIE     
               (Overlapping, gesturing) 
          Hey, well, listen ... hey, you wanna
          come upstairs and, uh ... and have a 
          glass of wine and something?  Aw, no, 
          I mean ... I mean, you don't have to, 
          you're probably late and everything else ...

                    ALVY 
          No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure. 

                    ANNIE 
          You sure?

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping) 
          No, I got time. 

                    ANNIE 
          Okay.

                    ALVY 
          Sure, I got ... I got nothing, uh, 
          nothing till my analyst's appointment.

They move toward Annie's apartment building.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, you see an analyst?

                    ALVY 
          Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years. 

                    ANNIE 
          Fifteen years?

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more 
          year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.

                    ANNIE 
          Fifteen-aw, come on, you're . . . yeah, 
          really?

INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT

Alvy, standing, looks around the apartment.  There are lots of books, framed 
photographs on the white wall.  A terrace can be seen from the window.  He 
picks up a copy of Ariet, by Sylvia Platb, as Annie comes out of the kitchen 
carrying two glasses.  She hands them to Alvy.

                    ALVY 
          Sylvia Plath.

                    ANNIE 
          M'hm...

                    ALVY
          Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide 
          was misinterpreted as romantic, by the 
          college-girl mentality.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, yeah.

                    ALVY 
          Oh, sorry.

                    ANNIE 
          Right.  Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, 
          some of her poems seem - neat, you know.

                    ALVY
          Neat?

                    ANNIE 
          Neat, yeah.

                    ALVY 
          Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen 
          seventy-five, you know that "neat" went 
          out, I would say, at the turn of the 
          century. 
               (Annie laughs) 
          Who-who are-who are those photos on 
          the wall?

                    ANNIE 
               (Moving over to the photographs) 
          Oh ... oh, well, you see now now, uh, 
          that's my dad, that's Father-and that's 
          my ... brother, Duane.

                    ALVY 
          Duane?

                    ANNIE
               (Pointing) 
          Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is 
          Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.

                    ALVY   
          Well, who's Sadie?

                    ANNIE  
          Sadie?  Oh, well, Sadie... 
               (Laughing) 
          Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through 
          Grammy's brother George.  Uh, George was 
          real sweet, you know, he had that thing.  
          What is that thing where you, uh, where 
          you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a 
          sentence, you know-what is it?  Uh ...

                    ALVY 
          Uh, narcolepsy.

                    ANNIE
          Narcolepsy, right, right.  Right.  So, 
          anyway, so ... 
               (Laughing) 
          George, uh, went to the union, see, to 
          get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the 
          union always gave George this big turkey 
          at Christmas time because he was ... 
               (Annie points her fingers to each 
               side of her head, indicating George 
               was a little crazy) 
          shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the 
          First World War. 
               (Laughing hysterically, she opens 
               a cabinet door and takes out a 
               bottle of wine) 
          Anyway, so, so ... 
               (Laughing through the speech) 
          George is standing in line, oh, just a sec 
          ...uh, getting his free turkey, but the 
          thing is, he falls asleep and he never 
          wakes up. So, so...
               (Laughing) 
          so, he's dead ... 
               (Laughing) 
          he's dead.  Yeah.  Oh, dear.  Well, 
          terrible, huh, wouldn't you say?  I 
          mean, that's pretty unfortunate.

Annie unscrews the bottle of wine, silent now after her speech.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, it's a great story, though, I 
          mean, I... I ... it really made my day.  
          Hey, I think I should get outta here, 
          you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, 
          you know ...

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Oh, really?  Oh, well ... uh, uh, maybe, 
          uh, maybe, we, uh ...

                    ALVY 
          ... and ... uh, yeah, uh ... uh, you 
          know, I-I-I... 

They move outside to the terrace, Alvy still holding the glasses, Annie the 
wine.  They stand in front of the railing, Annie pouring the wine into the 
held-out glasses.

                    ANNIE 
          Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.

                    ALVY
          No, I know, but ... but, you know, I'm 
          all perspired and everything.

                    ANNIE 
          Well, didn't you take, uh ... uh, a 
          shower at the club?

                    ALVY
          Me?  No, no, no, 'cause I never shower 
          in a public place.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Why not?

                    ALVY 
          'Cause I don't like to get naked in front 
          of another man, you know-it's, uh ...

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Oh, I see, I see.

                    ALVY 
          You know, I don't like to show my body 
          to a man of my gender-

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I see.  I guess-

                    ALVY     
          -'cause, uh, you never know what's 
          gonna happen.

                    ANNIE     
               (Sipping her wine and laughing) 
          Fifteen years, huh?

                    ALVY
          Fifteen years, yeah.

                    ANNIE     
          Yeah.  Oh, God bless!

They     put their glasses together in a toast.

                    ALVY
          God bless.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Well, uh ... 
               (Pausing) 
          You're what Grammy Hall would call a 
          real Jew.

                    ALVY  
               (Clearing his throat) 
          Oh, thank you.

                    ANNIE
               (Smiling) 
          Yeah, well ... you-She hates Jews.  She 
          thinks that they just make money, but let 
          me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, 
          is she ever.  I'm tellin' yuh.

                    ALVY 
               (pointing toward the apartment 
               after a short pause) 
          So, did you do shoot the photographs 
          in there or what?

                    ANNIE
               (Nodding, her hand on her hip) 
          Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.

Annie's thoughts pop on the screen as she talks: I dabble?  Listen to me-what 
a jerk!

                    ALVY 
          They're ... they're... they're wonderful, 
          you know.  They have ... they have, uh 
          ... a ... a quality.
     
As do Alvy's: You are a great-looking girl

                    ANNIE
          Well, I-I-I would-I would like to take 
          a serious photography course soon.

Again, Annie's thoughts pop on: He probably thinks I'm a yo-yo

                    ALVY 
          Photography's interesting, 'cause, you 
          know, it's-it's a new art form, and a, 
          uh, a set of aesthetic criteria have 
          not emerged yet.

And Alvy's: I wonder what she looks like naked?

                    ANNIE 
          Aesthetic criteria?  You mean, whether 
          it's, uh, good photo or not?

I'm not smart enough for him.  Hang in there

                    ALVY 
          The-the medium enters in as a condition 
          of the art form itself.  That's-

I don't know what I'm saying-she senses I'm shallow

                    ANNIE 
          Well, well, I ... to me-I ... I mean, 
          it's-it's-it's all instinctive, you 
          know.  I mean, I just try to uh, feel 
          it, you know?  I try to get a sense of 
          it and not think about it so much.

God, I hope he doesn't turn out to be a shmuck like the others

                    ALVY 
          Still, still we- You need a set of 
          aesthetic guide lines to put it in 
          social perspective, I think.

Christ, I sound like FM radio.  Relax

They're quiet for a moment, holding wine glasses and sipping.  The sounds of 
distant traffic from the street can be heard on the terrace.  Annie, laughing, 
speaks first.

                    ANNIE 
          Well, I don't know.  I mean, I guess-I 
          guess you must be sorta late, huh?

                    ALVY 
          You know, I gotta get there and begin 
          whining soon ... otherwise I- Hey ... 
          well, are you busy Friday night?

                    ANNIE 
          Me?  Oh, uh.         
               (Laughing) 
          No.

                    ALVY 
               (Putting his band on his forehead) 
          Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have 
          something.  Well, what about Saturday 
          night?

                    ANNIE 
               (Nodding) 
          Oh ... nothing.  Not-no, no!

                    ALVY 
          Oh, you ... you're very popular, I can see.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          I know.

                    ALVY 
          Gee, boy, what do you have?  You have 
          plague?

                    ANNIE     
          Well, I mean, I meet a lot of ... jerks, 
          you know-

                    ALVY
          Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.

                    ANNIE     
               (Overlapping) 
          -what I mean?

                    ALVY     
          I think that's, uh-

                    ANNIE
               (Interrupting) 
          But I'm thinking about getting some 
          cats, you know, and then they ... Oh, 
          wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean 
               (Laughing) 
          oh, shoot!  No, Saturday night I'm 
          gonna-
               (Laughing) 
          gonna sing.  Yeah.

                    ALVY
          You're gonna sing?  Do you sing?  Well, 
          no, it isn't
               (Overlapping) 
          No kidding? 
               (Overlapping) 
          -this is my first time.  Oh, really?  Where?  
          I'd like to come. 
               (Laughing) 
          Oh, no, no, no, no, no!  No, I'm interested!

                    ANNIE
               (Laughing) 
          Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning 
          sort of at club.  I don't-

                    ALVY
               (Overlapping) 
          No, so help me.

                    ANNIE
               (Overlapping) 
          -it's my first time.

                    ALVY
          That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what 
          that's like.  Listen-

                    ANNIE
               (Interrupting) 
          Yeah.

                    ALVY
               (Overlapping) 
          -you're gonna like night clubs, they're 
          really a lotta fun.

INT. NIGHT CLUB-NIGHT

Annie stands on center stage with a microphone, a pianist behind her.  A 
Bright light is focused on her; the rest of the club is in darkness.  There 
are the typical sounds and movements of a nightclub audience: low conversation,
curling smoke, breaking glass, microphone bum, moving chairs, waiters 
clattering trays, a ringing phone as Annie sings "It Had to Be You.

EXT. CITY STREET-NIGHT.

Alvy and Annie walk quickly down the sidewalk. 

                    ANNIE 
          I was awful.  I'm so ashamed!  I can't 
          sing. 

                    ALVY 
          Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad 
          restless.

                    ANNIE 
          Whatta you mean, a tad restless?  Oh, 
          my God, I mean, they hated me.

                    ALVY 
          No, they didn't.  You have a wonderful 
          voice.

                    ANNIE 
          No, I'm gonna quit!

                    ALVY
          No, I'm not gonna letcha.  You have a 
          great voice.

                    ANNIE
          Really, do you think so, really?

                    ALVY
          Yeah!

                    ANNIE
          Yeah?

                    ALVY
          It's terrific.

                    ANNIE
               (Overlapping) 
          Yeah, you know something?  I never even 
          took a lesson, either.

They stop in the middle of the sidewalk.  Alvy turns Annie around to face him.

                    ALVY 
          Hey, listen, listen.

                    ANNIE
                What?

                    ALVY
          Gimme a kiss.

                    ANNIE
                Really?

                    ALVY
          Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna 
          go home later, right?

                    ANNIE
          Yeah.

                    ALVY
          And-and uh, there's gonna be all that 
          tension.  You know, we never kissed before 
          and I'll never know when to make the right 
          move or anything.  So we'll kiss now we'll 
          get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?  

                    ANNIE
                 Oh, all right.

                    ALVY 
          And we'll digest our food better.

                    ANNIE
                Okay.

                    ALVY 
          Okay?

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah.

They kiss.

                    ALVY 
          So now we can digest our food.  

They turn and start walking again.  

                    ANNIE 
          We can digest our-

                    ALVY 
          Okay. Yeah.

INT. DELI-NIGHT

Annie and Alvy sit down in a booth.  The deli is fairly well lit and crowded. 
Conversation, plates clattering, can be heard over the dialogue.  The waiter 
comes over to them to take their order.

                    ALVY 
               (To the waiter) 
          I'm gonna have a corned beef.

                    ANNIE 
               (To the waiter) 
          Yeah ... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a 
          pastrami on white bread with, uh, 
          mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce. 
               (Alvy involuntarily makes a face 
               as the waiter leaves) 
          Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you 
          and, uh, were you depressed about that?

                    ALVY 
          Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't 
          cure.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh.  And your first wife was Allison?

                    ALVY 
          My first... Yes, she was nice, but you 
          know, uh, it was my fault.  I was just... 
          I was too crazy.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh.

INT. DARKENED BEDROOM-NIGHT

Alvy and Annie in bed together.

                    ANNIE
          M'm, that was so nice.  That was nice.

                    ALVY
          As Balzac said ...

                    ANNIE
                H'm?

                    ALVY
                 "There goes another novel." 
               (They laugh) 
          Jesus, you were great.

                    ANNIE
                Oh, yeah?

                    ALVY
                Yeah.

                    ANNIE
                Yeah?

                    ALVY
                Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.

                    ANNIE
          No. 
               (She turns and looks at Alvy, 
               then laughs) 
          You're a wreck.

                    ALVY
                Really.  I mean it.  I-I'll never play 
          the piano again.

                    ANNIE
                     (Lighting a joint and laughing) 
          You're really nuts.  I don't know, you 
          really thought it was good?  Tell me.

                    ALVY
          Good?  I was-

                    ANNIE
               (Overlapping) 
          No.

                    ALVY
          No, that was the most fun I've ever 
          had without laughing.

                    ANNIE
               (Laughing) 
          Here, you want some?

                    ALVY
          No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any 
          major hallucinogenics because I took 
          a puff like five years ago at a party and

                    ANNIE
                Yeah?

                    ALVY
                -tried to take my pants off over my 
          head ... 
               (Annie laughs)
          ...  my ear.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, I don't know, I don't really.  I 
          don't do it very often, you know, just 
          sort of, er ... relaxes me at first.

                    ALVY 
          M'hm. 
               (He pushes himself up from the 
               bed and looks down at Annie)
          You're not gonna believe this, but-

                    ANNIE
                What?  What?

                                        CUT TO:


INT. BOOKSTORE-DAY

Annie and Alvy browsing in crowded bookstore.  Alvy, carrying two books, 
"Death and Western Thought" and "The Denial of Death", moves over to where 
Annie is looking.

                    ALVY
          Hey?

                    ANNIE
                H'm?

                    ALVY
                I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I 
          think, because I-I think you should 
          read them.  You know, instead of that 
          cat book.

                    ANNIE
                     (Looking at the books Alvy 
               is bolding) 
          That's, uh ... 
               (Laughing) 
          that's pretty serious stuff there.

                    ALVY
                Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, 
          I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, 
          I think.  Big-

                    ANNIE
                     (Overlapping) 
          Yeah?

                    ALVY
                -big subject with me, yeah.

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah?

They move over to the cashier line.

                    ALVY
               (Gesturing) 
          I've a very pessimistic view of life.  
          You should know this about me if we're 
          gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that 
          life is-is divided up into the horrible 
          and the miserable.

                    ANNIE
                M'hm.

                    ALVY
          Those are the two categories ...

                    ANNIE 
          M'hm.

                    ALVY    
          ... you know, they're- The-the horrible 
          would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal 
          cases, you know?

                    ANNIE
                M'hm.

                    ALVY    
          And blind people, crippled ...

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah.

                    ALVY
                   I don't-don't know how they get through 
          life.  It's amazing to me.

                    ANNIE
                M'hm.

                    ALVY
                You know, and the miserable is everyone 
          else.  That's-that's all.  So-so when 
          you go through life you should be thankful 
          that you're miserable, because that's- 
          You're very lucky ... to be ... 
               (Overlapping Annie's laughter) 
          ... to be miserable.

                    ANNIE
                U-huh.

EXT. PARK-DAY

It's a beautiful sunny day in Central Park.  People are sitting on benches, 
others strolling, some walking dogs.  One woman stands feeding cooing pigeons.
Alvy's and Annie's voices are heard off screen as they observe the scene before
them.  An older man and woman walk into view.

                    ALVY
          Look, look at that guy.

                    ANNIE
                M'hm.

                    ALVY
          There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. 
          When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, 
          you know? 
               (Over Annie's laughter) 
          He's the latest! just came back from 
          the gin-rummy farm last night. He 
          placed third.

                    ANNIE
                     (Laughing) 
          M'hm.  Yeah.  Yeah.

The camera shows them sitting side by side relaxed on a bench.

                    ALVY 
               (Watching two men approach, one 
               lighting a cigar) 
          Look at these guys.

                    ANNIE
                Yeah.

                    ALVY   
          Oh, that's hilarious.  They're back 
          from Fire Island.  They're ... they're 
          sort of giving it a chance-you know what 
          I mean?

                    ANNIE
                  Oh! Italian, right?

                    ALVY 
                 Yeah, he's the Mafia.  Linen Supply Business 
          or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?

                    ANNIE
                     (Laughing) 
          Oh, yeah.

                    ALVY 
          No, I'm serious. 
               (Over Annie's laughter) 
          I just got my mustache wet.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, yeah?

                    ALVY 
               (As another man walks by) 
          And there's the winner of the Truman 
          Capote look-alike contest.

EXT. STREET-NIGHT

Alvy and Annie walk almost in silhouette along the dock, the New York City 
skyline in the background.  Alvy has his arm around Annie and they walk slowly.
No one else is around.

                    ANNIE     
          You see, like you and I ...

                    ALVY     
          You are extremely sexy.

                    ANNIE     
          No, I'm not.

                    ALVY     
          Unbelievably sexy.  Yes, you are.  
          Because ... you know what you are?  
          You're-you're polymorphously perverse.

                    ANNIE     
          Well, what does-what does that mean?  
          I don't know what that is.

                    ALVY 
          Uh ... uh, you're-you're exceptional 
          in bed because you got -you get pleasure 
          in every part of your body when I touch you.

                    ANNIE 
          Ooooh!

They stop walking.  Holding Annie's arms, Alvy turns her to face him.  The 
South Street Bridge, lit up for the night, is in the background.

                    ALVY 
          You know what I mean?  Like the tip 
          o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth 
          or your kneecaps ... you get excited.

                    ANNIE 
          Come on. 
               (Laughing) 
          Yeah.  You know what?  You know, I 
          like you, I really mean it.  I really do 
          like you.

                    ALVY
          You- Do you love me?

                    ANNIE
          Do I love you?

                    ALVY
          That's the key question.

                    ANNIE
          Yeah.

                    ALVY
          I know you've only known me a short 
          while.

                    ANNIE 
          Well, I certainly ... I think that's 
          very- Yeah, yeah ... 
               (Laughing) 
          yeah.  Do you love me?

                    ALVY
                I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word 
          for what...

                    ANNIE
                Yeah.

                    ALVY
          - I ... I love you. 
               (Over Annie's laughter) 
          You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you. 
               (Over Annie's laughter) 
          I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.

                    ANNIE
                Yeah.

                    ALVY 
               (Putting his arms around her neck) 
          Don't you think I do?

                    ANNIE
                I dunno.

They kiss as a foghorn sounds in the distance.

INT. ALVY'S APARTMENT

Alvy, somewhat distraught, is following Annie around his apartment, which is 
filled with boxes and suitcases, clothes and framed pictures.  They both carry 
cartons.

                    ALVY
                Whatta you mean?  You're not gonna give 
          up your own apartment, are you?

                    ANNIE
               (Putting down the carton) 
          Of course.

                    ALVY
          Yeah, bu-bu-but why?

                    ANNIE
          Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, 
          that's why.

                    ALVY
          Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.

                    ANNIE
          I have a tiny apartment.

                    ALVY
                    Yeah, I know it's small.

                    ANNIE 
               (Picking up the suitcases and 
               walking into the bedroom) 
          That's right, and it's got bad plumbing 
          and bugs.

                    ALVY
               (Picking up some pictures and 
               following Annie into the bedroom) 
          All right, granted, it has bad plumbing 
          and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a 
          negative thing.  You know, bugs are-are-uh, 
          entomology is a ... 
               (Annie, reacting, tosses the 
               suitcases and some loose clothing 
               onto the bed.  She sits down on the 
               edge, looking away. Alvy walks in, 
               pictures and carton in band, still 
               talking) 
          ... rapidly growing field.

                    ANNIE
          You don't want me to live with you?

                    ALVY 
          How- I don't want you to live with me?  
          How- Whose idea was it?

                    ANNIE 
          Mine.

                    ALVY 
          Ye-ah.  Was it ... It was yours actually, 
          but, uh, I approved it immediately.

                    ANNIE 
          I guess you think that I talked you into 
          something, huh?
               (putting pictures on the mantel) 
          
                    ALVY
          No-what, what ...? I ... we live together, 
          we sleep together, we eat together.  Jesus, 
          you don't want it to be like we're married, 
          do yuh?

He moves over to the carton of books on the window seat and reaches in.  He 
starts tossing books off screen.

                    ANNIE
               (Looking up at Alvy) 
          How is it any different?

                    ALVY  
               (Gesturing) 
          It's different 'cause you keep your own 
          apartment. 
               (Holding a book, he starts walking 
               around the room) 
          Because you know it's there, we don't 
          have to go to it, we don't have to deal 
          with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating 
          life raft ... that we know that we're not 
          married.

He tosses the book on the bed and walks back to the window seat.

                    ANNIE  
               (Still sitting on the bed) 
          That little apartment is four hundred 
          dollars a month, Alvy.

                    ALVY   
               (Looking at Annie) 
          That place is four hundred dollars a month?

                    ANNIE  
          Yes, it is.  

                    ALVY 
               (Whistling) 
          It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs.  Jesus, 
          I'll-My accountant will write it off as a 
          tax deduction, I'll pay for it.

                    ANNIE 
               (Shaking her head) 
          You don't think I'm smart enough to be 
          serious about.

                    ALVY  
          Hey, don't be ridiculous.

Alvy moves over to the bed and sits down next to Annie.

                    ANNIE  
          Then why are you always pushing me to take 
          those college courses like I was dumb or 
          something?

                    ALVY  
               (Putting his hand to his forehead) 
          'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing.  
          You meet a lotta interesting professors.  
          You know, it's stimulating.

EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY

Annie and Alvy, in Annie's VW, driving to their summerhouse.  The camera moves 
with them as they pass a house with a lighted window, blooming foliage.  There 
is no dialogue, but it is a comfortable quiet.  Classical music plays in the 
background.

                                        CUT TO:

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT

Annie, sitting cross-legged on a wooden chest in the bedroom, is browsing 
through a school catalogue.  Alvy lies in bed reading.

                    ANNIE 
               (Reading) 
          Does this sound like a good course?  
          Uh, "Modern American Poetry"?  Uh, or, 
          uh-let's see now ... maybe I should, uh, 
          take "Introduction to the Novel."

                    ALVY 
          Just don't take any course where they 
          make you read Beowulf.

                    ANNIE 
          What? 
               (Laughing) 
          Hey, listen, what-what do you think?  Do 
          you think we should, uh, go to that-that 
          party in Southampton tonight? 

Alvy leans over and kisses her shoulder.

                    ALVY 
          No, don't be silly.  What-what do we need 
          other people for? 
               (He puts his arms around her neck, 
               kissing her, Annie making muffled 
               sounds) 
          You know, we should-we should just turn 
          out the lights, you know, and play hide 
          and seek or something.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Well, okay.  Well, listen, I'm gonna get 
          a cigarette, okay?

                    ALVY 
               (Yelling out to her as she leaves 
               the room) 
          Yeah, grass, right?  The illusion that 
          it will make a white woman more like 
          Billie Holiday.

                    ANNIE 
               (Off screen) 
          Well, have you ever made love high?

                    ALVY
          Me, no.  You ... I-I-you know, if I 
          have grass or alcohol or anything I 
          get unbearably wonderful.  I get too, 
          too wonderful for words.  You know, 
          I don't-I don't know why you have to, 
          uh, get high every time we make love.

                    ANNIE 
               (Moving back into the room and 
               lighting a joint) 
          It relaxes me.

                    ALVY 
          Oh, you-you have to be artificially 
          relaxed before we can go to bed?

                    ANNIE 
               (Closing the door) 
          Well, what's the difference, anyway?

                    ALVY 
          Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium 
          pentothal.  You can sleep through it.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, come on, look who's talking.  You've 
          been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. 
               (She gets into bed and takes a 
               puff of marijuana) 
          You should smoke some o' this.  You'd be 
          off the couch in no time.

                    ALVY 
          Oh, come, you don't need that.

Alvy, sitting down on the bed, moves over to Annie and takes the weed from her.

                    ANNIE 
          What are you doing?

                    ALVY 
               (Kissing her) 
          No, no, no, what ... You can once, you 
          can live without it once.  Come on.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.
               (Laughing and making sounds) 
          M'mrnm.

                    ALVY 
          M'm, wait, I got a great idea. 
               (He gets up and goes over to the 
               closet, taking out a light bulb.  
               He goes back to the bed and turns 
               out the lamp on the night table) 
          Hang in there for a second.  I got a 
          little-little artifact.  A little erotic 
          artifact, that-that I brought up from the 
          city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect. 
               (He turns the lamp back on, having 
               replaced the bulb with the red one 
               from the closet) 
          I just ... there ... There's a little Old 
          New Orleans ... essence.  Now-now we can go 
          about our business here and we can even 
          develop photographs if we want to.  There, 
          now there. 
               (He undresses and crawls into bed, 
               taking Annie in his arms) 
          M'mmm.  M'mmm.  Hey, is something wrong?  

                    ANNIE

          Uh-uh-why?

                    ALVY 
          I don't know.  You- It's like you're-
          you're removed.

                    ANNIE 
          No, I'm fine.

As Annie speaks, her inner self (ghostlike, moves up from the bed and) sits 
down on a chair, watching.

                    ALVY 
          Really?

                    ANNIE 
          U-huh.

                    ALVY 
          I don't know, but you seem sort of distant. 

                    ANNIE 
          Let's just do it, all right?

                    ALVY
               (Kissing and caressing Annie) 
          Is it my imagination or are you just 
          going through the motions?

                    ANNIE'S SPIRIT  
          Alvy, do you remember where I put my 
          drawing pad?  Because while you two are 
          doing that, I think I'm gonna do some 
          drawing.

                    ALVY 
               (Reacting) 
          You see, that's what I call removed.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, you have my body.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, but that's not-that's no good.  
          I want the whole thing. 

                    ANNIE 
               (Sighing) 
          Well, I need grass and so do you.

                    ALVY 
          Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass 
               (Clearing his throat)
           because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-

                    ANNIE 
               (Overlapping) 
          M'hm.

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping) 
          -so if I get a laugh from a person who's 
          high, it doesn't count.  You know-'cause 
          they're always laughin'.

                    ANNIE 
          Were you always funny?

                    ALVY 
          Hey, what is this-an interview?  We're 
          supposed to be making love.

                                        CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE.

A typical old-fashioned theatrical agency in a Broadway office building. 
Autographed 8 X 12 is plastered in the sloppy room.  The agent, chewing a 
cigar, sits behind his desk talking to one of his clients, a comedian, who 
stands with his hands in his pockets.  A young Alvy sits stiffly in a chair 
nearby watching.

                    AGENT 
          This guy is naturally funny.  I think 
          he can write for you.

                    COMIC 
               (Buttoning his jacket) 
          Yeah, yeah.  Hey, kid, he tells me you're 
          really good.  Well, lemme explain a little 
          bit o' how I work.  You know, you can tell 
          right off the bat that I don't look like 
          a funny guy when I come-you know, like some 
          o' the guys that come out.  You know, right 
          away 
               (Gesturing) 
          they're gonna tell yuh their stories, you're 
          gonna fall down, but I gotta be really 
          talented.  Material's gotta be sensational 
          for me 'cause I work, you know, with very, 
          very ... Come on, I'm kinda classy, you 
          know what I mean?  Uh ... uh ... lemme 
          explain.  For instance, I open with an 
          opening song.  A musical start like 
               (Ad-lib singing) 
          and I walk out 
               (Ad-lib singing)  
          "Place looks wonderful from here and 
          you folks look wonderful from here! 
               (Singing)
          "And seein' you there
          With a smile on your face
          Makes me shout
          This must be the place."
          Then I stop right in the middle and then 
          I open with some jokes.  Now, that's where 
          I need you, right there.  For instance, like 
          I say, "Hey, I just got back from Canada, 
          you know, they speak a lotta French up 
          there.  The only way to remember Jeanne 
          d'Arc means the light's out in the bathroom!" 
               (He laughs.  Seated Alvy looks 
               up smiling) 
          "Oh, I met a big lumberjack ..."

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
               (To himself) 
          Jesus, this guy's pathetic. 

                    COMIC 
               (Overlapping above speech) 
          ... big lumberjack ...

                    ALVY'S VOICE 
               (To himself while the comic 
               continues his routine) 
          Look at him mincing around, like he 
          thinks he's real cute.  You wanna throw 
          up.  If only I had the nerve to do my 
          own jokes.  I don't know how much longer 
          I can keep this smile frozen on my face.  
          I'm in the wrong business, I know it.

                    COMIC 
               (Overlapping above speech) 
          "'Cherie, come back.  I love you. 
               (Shaking his lips and mimicking) 
          But, uh, Cheri, what will I do with this, 
          uh?' He says, 'Aw, Marie, sometime you 
          make me so mad."' 
               (Laughing) 
          Oh, they scream at that.  Now, write me 
          somethin' like that, will yuh?  Kinda 
          French number, can yuh do it?  Huh, kid?

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

The darkened auditorium is filled with college students applauding and cheering,
excited, as Alvy stands on spotlighted stage holding the microphone.

                    ALVY 
               (Gesturing) 
          W-where am I? I-I keep ... I have to 
          reorient myself.  This is the University 
          of Wisconsin, right?  So I'm always ... 
          I'm tense and ... uh, when I'm playin' a 
          col- I've a very bad history with colleges.  
          You know, I went to New York University and, 
          uh, tsch, I was thrown out of NYU my freshman 
          year ... for cheating on my metaphysics final.  
          You know, I looked within the soul of the 
          boy sitting next to me- 
               (The audience laughs; they're with him)
           -and when I was thrown out, my mother, 
          who's an emotionally high-strung woman, 
          locked herself in the bathroom and took an 
          overdose of mah-jongg tiles. 
               (More applause and laughter) 
          And, uh, tsch, I was depressed.  I was ... 
          in analysis, I-I, uh, was suicidal; as a 
          matter of fact, uh, I would have killed 
          myself but I was in analysis with a strict 
          Freudian and if you kill yourself ... they 
          make you pay for the sessions you miss.

INT. BACKSTAGE OF THEATER.

Students mill around Alvy banding him pens and paper for autographs.
Annie is next to him, talking over the chattering fans.

                    ANNIE 
          Alvy, you were ... Alvy, you were just 
          great, I'm not kidding.  It was- You 
          were so neat.

                    ALVY 
          C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah.  Yeah.  And you know something?  
          I think that I'm starting to get more 
          of your references, too.

                    ALVY
          Are yuh?

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah.

                    ALVY 
          Well, the twelve o'clock show is 
          completely different than the nine.

                    YOUNG WOMAN 
               (Interrupting) 
          May I have your autograph?

                    ANNIE 
               (Over lapping above speech) 
          Oh.

                    ALVY 
               (To Annie, while autographing) 
          You're so sure about it.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to 
          tomorrow.  I mean, you know, I think that 
          it'll be really nice to meet Mother and 
          Father. 

They start moving toward the exit, a girl snapping a picture of Alvy with a 
flash camera as they walk through the crowd.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately. 
               (To one of his fans) 
          Thank you.

                    ANNIE 
          No, I don't think so.  No, I don't think 
          they're gonna hate you at all.  On the 
          contrary, I think-

                    ALVY 
          Yeah.

                    ANNIE 
          It's Easter.  You know, we'll have a nice 
          dinner, we'll sit down and eat.  I think 
          they're gonna really like you.

EXT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' HOME-DAY

The camera shows a neat two-story house surrounded by a well-manicured green 
lawn, then cuts to:

INT. DINING ROOM.

Alvy and the Halls are eating Easter dinner.  The sun is pouring through a big 
picture window, shining on a large, elegantly laid out table. Alvy sits, at one
end,- rubbing his nose and chewing, the Halls flanking him on either side: Mr.
and Mrs. Hall, Grammy, and Annie's brother, Duane.

                    MOM HALL 
               (Holding her wine glass) 
          It's a nice ham this year, Mom. 

Grammy Hall takes a sip of her wine and nods.

                    ANNIE 
               (Smiling at Duane) 
          Oh, yeah.  Grammy always does such 
          a good job.

                    DAD HALL 
               (Chewing) 
          A great sauce.

                    ALVY 
          It is. 
               (Smacking his lips) 
          It's dynamite ham.

Grammy Hall stares down the table at Alvy; a look of utter dislike. Alvy tries 
not to notice.

                    MOM HALL 
               (To Dad Hall, smoothing her hair) 
          We went over to the swap meet.  Annie, 
          Gram and I. Got some nice picture frames.

                    ANNIE 
          We really had a good time.

Grammy continues to stare at Alvy; he is now dressed in the long black coat and
hat of the Orthodox Jew, complete with mustache and heard.

                    MOM HALL 
               (Lighting a cigarette and turning 
               to Alvy) 
          Ann tells us that you've been seeing a 
          psychiatrist for fifteen years.

                    ALVY 
               (Setting down his glass and coughing) 
          Yes.  I'm making excellent progress.  
          Pretty soon when I lie down on his couch, 
          I won't have to wear the lobster bib.

Mom Hall reacts by sipping from her glass and frowning.  Grammy continues to 
stare.

                    DAD HALL 
          Duane and I went out to the boat basin.

                    DUANE 
          We were caulkin' holes all day.

                    DAD HALL 
          Yeah. 
               (Laughing) 
          Randolph Hunt was drunk, as usual.

                    MOM HALL 
          Oh, that Randolph Hunt.  You remember 
          Randy Hunt, Annie.  He was in the choir 
          with you.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, yes, yes.

Alvy, leaning his elbow on the table, looks out toward the camera.

                    ALVY 
               (To the audience) 
          I can't believe this family. 
               (Making chewing sounds) 
          Annie's mother.  She really's beautiful.  
          And they're talkin' swap meets and boat 
          basins, and the old lady at the end of 
          the table 
               (Pointing to Grammy) 
          is a classic Jew hater.  And, uh, they, 
          they realty look American, you know, 
          very healthy and ... like they never 
          get sick or anything.  Nothing like my 
          family.  You know, the two are like oil 
          and water.

The screen splits in half - on the right is Alvy's family - his mother, father,
aunt and uncle-busily eating at the crowded kitchen table.  They eat quickly 
and interrupt one another loudly.  On the left the Halls in their dining room. 
Both dialogues overlap, juxtaposed.

                    ALVY'S FATHER 
          Let 'im drop dead!  Who needs his 
          business?!

                    ALVY'S MOTHER 
          His wife has diabetes!

                    ALVY'S FATHER 
          Di-diabetes?  Is that any excuse?  
          Diabetes?

                    ALVY'S UNCLE 
          The man is fifty years old and doesn't 
          have a substantial job.

                    ALVY'S AUNT 
               (Putting more meat on her 
               husband's plate) 
          Is that a reason to steal from his father?

                    ALVY'S UNCLE 
          Whatta you talkin' about?  You don't 
          know what you're talking about.

                    ALVY'S AUNT 
          Yes, I know what I'm talking about.

                    ALVY'S MOTHER 
               (Interrupting) 
          George, defend him!

                    ALVY'S UNCLE 
               (Over Alvy's father's muttering) 
          No Moskowitz he had a coronary.

                    ALVY'S AUNT 
          You don't say.

                    ALVY'S MOTHER 
          We fast.

                    MOM HALL 
          Stupid Thelma Poindexter ... to the 
          Veterans Hospital.

                    DAD HALL 
          My God, he's the new president of the 
          El Regis.  Let me tell you, the man is 
          somethin' else.

                    MOM HALL 
          That's Jack's wife.  We used to make 
          that outta raisins.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, yes, that's right.  Did you see 
          the new play?

                    MOM HALL 
          Oh, you remember her, Annie.

                    ANNIE 
          Yes, I do.

The two families start talking back and forth to one another.  The screen is 
still split.

                    MOM HALL 
          How do you plan to spend the holidays, 
          Mrs. Singer?

                    DAD HALL 
          Fast?

                    ALVY'S FATHER 
          Yeah, no food.  You know, we have to 
          atone for our sins.

                    MOM HALL 
          What sins?  I don't understand.

                    ALVY'S FATHER 
          Tell you the truth, neither do we.

                                        CUT TO:

INT. DUANE'S BEDROOM-NIGHT

Duane, sitting on his bed, sees Alvy walking past the open door.

                    DUANE 
          Alvy.

                    ALVY 
               (Walking in) 
          Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?

                    DUANE 
          This is my room.

                    ALVY 
               (Looking around) 
          Oh, yeah? 
               (He clears his throat) 
          Terrific.

                    DUANE 
          Can I confess something?

Alvy sighs and sits down, leaning his arm on Duane's dresser.  Duane's face is 
big lighted by a single lamp.

                    DUANE 
          I tell you this because, as an artist, 
          I think you'll understand.  Sometimes 
          when I'm driving ... on the road at night
          ... I see two headlights coming toward me.  
          Fast.  I have this sudden impulse to turn 
          the wheel quickly, head-on into the 
          oncoming car.  I can anticipate the 
          explosion.  The sound of shattering glass.  
          The ... flames rising out of the flowing 
          gasoline.

                    ALVY 
               (Reacting and clearing his throat) 
          Right.  Tsch, well, I have to-I have 
          t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due 
          back on the planet earth. 

He slowly gets up and moves toward the door.

INT. THE HALLS' LIVING ROOM.

Mom and Dad Hall walk into the living room; Annie is with them.

                    MOM HALL
          Now, don't let it be so long, now.

                    ANNIE 
          No.

                    DAD HALL 
          And look up Uncle Bill, you promise. 

                    ANNIE 
          Okay.  Okay.

                    MOM HALL 
          Oh, he's adorable, Annie.

                    ANNIE 
          You think so?  Do you really?

                    MOM HALL 
          We're going to take them to the airport.
                    
                    DAD HALL 
          Oh, no-Duane can.  I haven't finished 
          my drink. 

                    ANNIE 
          Yes, Duane is.  I'll be right-

                    MOM HALL 
          M'mmm.

                    ANNIE 
          I just have time to get the, uh-

She walks out of the room as Mom and Dad Hall kiss.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Duane, behind the wheel, stares straight ahead.  It is raining very hard, the 
windshield wipers are moving quickly.  The headlights of another car brightens 
the interior of Duane's car as the camera shows first Duane, then Annie, then 
Alvy tensely staring straight ahead.

EXT. STREET- DAY

The camera bolds on a quiet New York City street; the buildings, brownstones. 
It's a warm day-people sit on front stoops, window boxes are planted. Annie 
walks into the frame first, then Alvy, who is walking to her right. They walk 
quickly, side by side, their voices heard before they move into the frame.

                    ANNIE 
               (Off screen) 
          You followed me.  I can't believe it!

                    ALVY 
               (Off screen) 
          I didn't follow you!

                    ANNIE  
          You followed me!

                    ALVY   
          Why?  'Cause I ... was walkin' along 
          a block behind you staring at you?  
          That's not following!

                    ANNIE 
          Well, what is your definition of 
          following?

                    ALVY 
               (Gasping) 
          Following is different.  I was spying.

                    ANNIE 
          Do you realize how paranoid you are?

                    ALVY 
          Paranoid?  I'm looking at you.  You 
          got your arms around another guy.

                    ANNIE 
          That is the worst kind of paranoia.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying.  
          I-I thought I'd surprise yuh.  Pick you 
          up after school.

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the 
          relationship flexible, remember?  
          It's your phrase.

                    ALVY 
          Oh, stop it.  But you were having an 
          affair with your college professor.  
          That jerk that teaches that incredible 
          crap course "Contemporary Crisis in 
          Western Man"!

                    ANNIE 
          "Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"!  
          You're really close.

                    ALVY 
          What's the difference?  It's all mental 
          masturbation.

                    ANNIE 
               (Stopping for a moment) 
          Oh, well, now we're finally getting to 
          a subject you know something about!

She walks away.

                    ALVY 
               (Catching up to her) 
          Hey, don't knock masturbation!  It's 
          sex with someone I love.

                    ANNIE 
               (Continuing to walk quickly) 
          We're not having an affair.  He's married.  
          He just happens to think I'm neat.

                    ALVY 
               (Still walking next to her) 
          "Neat"!  There's that- What are you-twelve 
          years old?  That's one o' your Chippewa 
          Falls expressions!  "He thinks I'm neat."

                    ANNIE 
          Who cares?  Who cares?

                    ALVY
          Next thing you know he'll find you keen
          and peachy, you know?  Next thing you 
          know he's got his hand on your ass!  

They both stop in the middle of the street.

                    ANNIE 
          You've always had hostility toward 
          David ever since I mentioned him!

                    ALVY 
          David?  You call your teacher David?

                    ANNIE 
          It's his name.

                    ALVY
                Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's 
          a biblical name.  Right?  W-What does 
          he call you?  Bathsheba?

He walks away.

                    ANNIE 
               (Calling after him) 
          Alvy!  Alvy!  You're the one who never 
          wanted to make a real commitment.  You 
          don't think I'm smart enough!  We had 
          that argument just last month, or don't 
          ou remember that day?

                                        CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN.

Alvy is at the sink washing dishes as the screen cuts to the scene of last 
month's argument.  Annie's voice is heard.

                    ANNIE 
               (Off screen) 
          I'm home!

                    ALVY 
               (Turning) 
          Oh, yeah?  How'd it go?

                    ANNIE 
               (Comes into the kitchen and puts 
               down a bag of groceries on the 
               kitchen table) 
          Oh, it was ... 
               (Laughing) 
          really weird.  But she's a very nice woman.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah?

                    ANNIE 
          And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, 
          Alvy, she had me sitting up.  So I told her 
          about-about the-the family and about my 
          feelings toward men and about my 
          relationship with my brother.

                    ALVY 
          M'm.

                    ANNIE 
          And then she mentioned penis envy ... 
          Did you know about that?

                    ALVY 
          Me?  I'm-I'm one of the few males who 
          suffers from that, so, so ... you know.

                    ANNIE 
          M'hm.

                    ALVY 
          G-go on, I'm interested.

                    ANNIE 
          Well, she said that I was very guilty 
          about my impulses toward marriage, 
          and-and children.

                    ALVY 
          M'hm.

                    ANNIE 
          And then I remembered when I was a kid 
          how I accidentally saw my parents making 
          love.

                    ALVY 
          Tsch.  Rea- All this happened in the 
          first hour?

                    ANNIE 
          M'hm.

                    ALVY 
          That's amazing. I-I-I ... I've been 
          goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, 
          I don't got ... nothing like that in-

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.

                    ALVY
          You cried?  I've never once cried.  
          Fantastic ...

                    ANNIE
               (Taking groceries from the bag) 
          Yeah.

                    ALVY
          I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.

                    ANNIE
          In-in ... Alvy, in my dream Frank 
          Sinatra is holding his pillow across 
          my face and I can't breathe.

                    ALVY 
          Sinatra?

                    ANNIE
          Yeah, and he's strangling me ...

                    ALVY
          Yeah?

                    ANNIE
          ... and I keep, you know, it's-

                    ALVY 
               (Taking a bottle of juice and 
               some celery from the bag) 
          Well, well, sure ... because he's a 
          singer and you're a singer, you know, 
          so it's perfect.  So you're trying to 
          suffocate yourself.  It-it makes perfect 
          sense.  Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic 
          ... kind of insight.

                    ANNIE 
               (Pointing her finger at Alvy) 
          She said, your name was Alvy Singer.

                    ALVY 
               (Turning to Annie) 
          Whatta you mean?  Me?

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah, yeah, yeah, you.  Because in the 
          dream ... I break Sinatra's glasses.

                    ALVY 
               (Putting his band to his mouth) 
          Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra 
          had glasses.  So whatta you saying that 
          I-I'm suffocating you?

                    ANNIE 
               (Turning, ajar in her hand) 
          Oh, and God, Alvy, I did ... this really 
          terrible thing to him.  Because then when 
          he sang it was in this real high-pitched 
          voice.

                    ALVY 
               (Thinking) 
          Tsch, what'd the doctor say?

                    ANNIE 
               (Putting away some groceries)
          Well, she said that I should probably 
          come five times a week.  And you know 
          something?  I don't think I mind analysis 
          at all.  The only question is, Will it 
          change my wife?

                    ALVY 
          Will it change your wife?

                    ANNIE 
          Will it change my life?

                    ALVY
          Yeah, but you said, "Will it change 
          my wife"!

                    ANNIE
          No, I didn't. 
               (Laughing) 
          I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.

                    ALVY
          You said, "Will it change. . ." Wife.  
          Will it change ...

                    ANNIE
               (Yelling out, angry) 
          Life.  I said, "life."

Alvy turns toward the camera.

                    ALVY 
               (To the audience) 
          She said, "Will it change my wife." You 
          heard that because you were there so I'm 
          not crazy.

                    ANNIE
                And, Alvy ... and then I told her about 
          how I didn't think you'd ever really take 
          me seriously, because you don't think that 
          I'm smart enough.

She walks out of the room.

                    ALVY
                     (To Annie's back, gesturing) 
          Why do you always bring that up?  Because 
          I encourage you to take adult-education 
          courses?  I think it's a wonderful thing.  
          You meet wonderful, interesting professors'.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. STREET

Annie stands at the open door of a cab, Alvy next to her gesturing as people 
and cars move by.

                    ALVY 
          Adult education is such junk!  The 
          professors are so phony.  How can you 
          do it?

                    ANNIE 
          A bit rapidly.  I don't care what you 
          say about David, he's a perfectly fine 
          teacher!

                    ALVY 
               (Interrupting) 
          David!  David!  I can't believe this! 
 
                    ANNIE 
          And what are you doing following me 
          around for, anyway?
  
                    ALVY 
          I'm following you and David, if you-

                    ANNIE  
               (Interrupting) 
          I just think we oughta call this 
          relationship quits! 

Annie gets into the cab; Alvy leans over and closes the door.

ALVY
                That's fine.  That's fine.  That's great! 
               (He turns toward the camera as the 
               cab drives away) 
          Well, I don't know what I did wrong. 
               (Gesturing) 
          I mean, I can't believe this.  Somewhere 
          she cooled off to me! 
               (He walks up to an older woman 
               walking down the street carrying 
               groceries) 
          Is it-is it something that I did?

WOMAN ON THE STREET 
          Never something you do.  That's how 
          people are. Love fades.

She moves on down the street.

ALVY
                     (Scratching his head) 
          Love fades.  God, that's a depressing
          thought. Have to ask you a question. 
               (He stops another passer-by,a man) 
          Don't go any further.  Now, with your 
          wife in bed, d-d-does she need some kind 
          o' artificial stimulation like-like marijuana?

                    MAN ON THE STREET 
          We use a large vibrating egg.

He walks on.

                    ALVY 
               (Continuing to walk) 
          Large vibrating egg.  Well, I ask a 
          psychopath, I get that kind of an answer.  
          Jesus, I-I, uh, here ... 
               (He moves up the sidewalk to 
               a young trendy-looking couple, 
               arms wrapped around each other) 
          You-you look like a really happy couple.  
          Uh, uh ... are you?

                    YOUNG WOMAN
                Yeah.

                    ALVY
                Yeah!  So ... so h-h-how do you account 
          for it?

                    YOUNG WOMAN 
          Uh, I'm very shallow and empty and I 
          have no ideas and nothing interesting 
          to say.

                    YOUNG MAN 
          And I'm exactly the same way.

                    ALVY 
          I see.  Well, that's very interesting.  
          So you've managed to work out something, huh?

                    YOUNG MAN 
          Right.

                    YOUNG WOMAN
                Yeah.

                    ALVY 
          Oh, well, thanks very much for talking 
          to me.

He continues to walk past some other passersby and moves into the street. A 
mounted policeman comes by and stops near him. Alvy looks at the horse, as if 
to speak.

                    ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
          You know, even as a kid I always went 
          for the wrong women.  I think that's my 
          problem.  When my mother took me to see 
          Snow White, everyone fell in love with 
          Snow White.  I immediately fell for the 
          Wicked Queen.

The scene dissolves into a sequence from the animated Snow White and the Seven 
Dwarfs.  The Wicked Queen, resembling Annie, sits in the palace before her 
mirror.  Alvy, as a cartoon figure, sits beside her, arms crossed in front of 
him.

                    WICKED QUEEN 
          We never have any fun anymore.

                    CARTOON FIGURE ALVY 
          How can you say that?

                    WICKED QUEEN 
          Why not?  You're always leaning on me
           to improve myself.

                    CARTOON FIGURE ALVY
                You're just upset.  You must be getting 
          your period.

                    WICKED QUEEN
                I don't get a period!  I'm a cartoon 
          character.  Can't I be upset once in 
          a while?

Rob, as a cartoon figure, enters and sits down on the other side of the Wicked 
Queen.

                    CARTOON FIGURE ROB   
          Max, will you forget about Annie?  I 
          know lots of women you can date.

                    CARTOON FIGURE ALVY
                I don't wanna go out with any other women.

                    CARTOON FIGURE ROB   
          Max, have I got a girl for you.  You are
          going to love her.  She's a reporter-

The cartoon figures of Alvy and Rob walk past the Wicked Queen; the screen 
dissolves into the interior of a concert ball.  Rob's voice carries over from 
the cartoon scene as the screen shows Alvy with the female reporter.  It's very
crowded, noisy; policeman and reporters are everywhere. Alvy stands with his 
hands in his pockets, watching the commotion.

                    CARTOON FIGURE ROB'S VOICE-OVER 
          -for Rolling Stone.

                    FEMALE REPORTER
                I think there are more people here to 
          see the Maharishi than there were to see 
          the Dylan concert.  I covered the Dylan 
          concert ... which gave me chills.  
          Especially when he sang "She takes just 
          like a woman And she makes love just 
          like a woman Yes, she does And she aches 
          just like a woman But she breaks just 
          like a little girl." 
               (They move toward the aisles as 
               a guard holds up his hands to stop 
               them) 
          Up to that I guess the most charismatic 
          event I covered was Mick's Birthday when 
                   the Stones played Madison Square Garden.

                    ALVY 
               (Laughing) 
          Man, that's great.  That's just great.

                    REPORTER 
          You catch Dylan?

                    ALVY 
               (Coughing) 
          Me?  No, no. I-I couldn't make it that 
          ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.

                    REPORTER 
          You have a raccoon?

                    ALVY 
               (Gesturing) 
          Tsch, a few.

                    REPORTER
                The only word for this is trans-plendid.  
          It's trans-plendid. 

                    ALVY 
          I can think of another word.

                    REPORTER
                He's God!  I mean, this man is God!  He's 
          got millions of followers who would crawl 
          all the way across the world just to touch 
          the hem of his garment.

                    ALVY 
          Really?  It must be a tremendous hem.

                    REPORTER 
          I'm a Rosicrucian myself.

                    ALVY 
          Are you?

                    REPORTER
                Yeah.

                    ALVY 
          I can't get with any religion that 
          advertises in Popular Mechanics.  Look- 
               (The Maharisbi, a small, chunky 
               man, walks out of the men's room, 
               huge bodyguards flanking him while 
               policemen bold back the crowds)
          there's God coming outta the men's room.

                    REPORTER
                It's unbelievably trans-plendid!  I was 
          at the Stones concert in Altamount when 
          they killed that guy, remember?

                    ALVY
                Yeah, were yuh?  I was-I was at an Alice 
          Cooper thing where six people were rushed 
          to the hospital with bad vibes.

INT. ALVY'S BEDROOM-NIGHT

The reporter is sitting up in bed, lighted cigarette in her hand.  Alvy, lying
next to her, rubs his eyes and puts on his eyeglasses.

                    REPORTER
                     (Looking down at him) 
          I hope you don't mind that I took so long 
          to finish.

                    ALVY
                     (Sighing) 
          Oh, no, no, don't be ... tsch ... don't 
          be silly.  You know, 
               (Yawning) 
          I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some 
          feeling back in my jaw now.

                    REPORTER
                Oh, sex with you is really a kafkaesque 
          experience.

                    ALVY 
          Oh, tsch, thank you.  H'm.

                    REPORTER
                I mean that as a compliment.

                    ALVY  
               (Making sounds) 
          I think-I think there's too much burden 
          placed on the orgasm, you know, to make 
          up for empty areas in life.

                    REPORTER
                Who said that?

                    ALVY 
               (Rubbing his chin and shoulder) 
          Uh, oh, I don't know.  It might have 
          been Leopold and Loeb. 
               (The telephone rings.  Alvy picks 
               it up, rising up slightly from the 
               bed, concerned, as he talks) 
          Hello.  Oh, hi ... Uh, no, what-what's 
          the matter?  What-what-what?  You sound 
          terrible ... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh
          -what kind of an emergency? ... No, well, 
          stay there.  Stay there, I'll come over 
          right now.  I'll come over right now.  Just 
          stay there, I'll come right over.

He hangs up.  The reporter sits in bed still, taking in the situation.

INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT HALLWAY

Annie, looking slightly distraught, goes to open the door to Alvy's knock.

                    ALVY 
          What's- It's me, open up.

                    ANNIE
                     (Opening the door) 
          Oh.

                    ALVY
                Are you okay?  What's the matter? 
               (They look at each other, Annie 
               sighing) 
          Are you all right?  What-

                    ANNIE
                There's a spider in the bathroom.

                    ALVY  
               (Reacting) 
          What?

                    ANNIE 
          There's a big black spider in the bathroom.

                    ALVY
                That's what you got me here for at three 
          o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a 
          spider in the bathroom?

                    ANNIE
                My God, I mean, you know how I am about 
          insects.
 
                    ALVY
                     (Interrupting, sighing) 
          Oooh.

                    ANNIE
          -I can't sleep with a live thing crawling 
          around in the bathroom.

                    ALVY
                Kill it!  For Go- What's wrong with you?  
          Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?

                    ANNIE
                     (Shaking her head) 
          No.

Alvy, disgusted, starts waving his hands and starts to move into the living 
room.

                    ALVY
                     (Sighing) 
          I told you a thousand times you should 
          always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray.  
          You never know who's gonna crawl over.

                    ANNIE 
               (Following him) 
          I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and 
          a fire extinguisher.

                    ALVY
          Jesus.  All right, gimme a magazine.  
          I- 'cause I'm a little tired. 
               (While Annie goes of to find 
               him a magazine, Alvy, still 
               talking, glances around the 
               apartment.  He notices a small 
               book on a cabinet and picks it up.) 
          You know, you, you joke with-about me, 
          you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for 
          anything.  An emergency, a tidal wave, 
          an earthquake.  Hey, what is this?  
          What?  Did you go to a rock concert?

                    ANNIE
                Yeah.

                    ALVY 
          Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd 
          you like it?  Was it-was it, I mean, 
          did it ... was it heavy?  Did it achieve 
          total heavy-ocity?  Or was it, uh...

                    ANNIE
                It was just great!

                    ALVY
                     (Thumbing through the book) 
          Oh, humdinger.  When- Well, I got a 
          wonderful idea.  Why don'tcha get the 
          guy who took you to the rock concert, 
          we'll call him and he can come over and 
          kill the spider.  You know, it's a-

He tosses the book down on the cabinet.

                    ANNIE 
                I called you; you wanna help me ... or 
          not?  H'h?  Here. 

She hands him a magazine.

                    ALVY
                     (Looking down at the magazine) 
          What is this?  What are you, since 
          when do you read the "National Review"?  
          What are you turning in to?

                    ANNIE
                     (Turning to a nearby chair for 
               some gum in her pocketbook) 
          Well, I like to try to get all points 
          of view.

                    ALVY 
          It's wonderful.  Then why don'tcha get 
          William F. Buckley to kill the spider?

                    ANNIE
                (Spinning around to face him) 
          Alvy, you're a little hostile, you 
          know that?  Not only that, you look 
          thin and tired.

She puts a piece of gum in her mouth.

                    ALVY
                 Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock 
          in the morning.  You, uh, you got me 
          outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't 
          get a taxi cab.  You said it was an 
          emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up 
          the stairs.  Hell - I was a lot more 
          attractive when the evening began.  
          Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you 
          going with a right-wing rock-and roll 
          star?  Is that possible?

                    ANNIE
                     (Sitting down on a chair arm 
               and looking up at Alvy) 
          Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?

                    ALVY
                Hey, what am I-your son?  Whatta you mean?
          I-I came over TV --_

                    ANNIE
                     (Touching his chest with her hand) 
          I got the good chocolate, Alvy.

                    ALVY
                Yeah, where is the spider?

                    ANNIE
                It really is lovely.  It's in the bathroom.

                    ALVY
                Is he in the bathroom?

                    ANNIE 
               (Rising from chair) 
          Hey, don't squish it, and after it's 
          dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? 
          And flush it a couple o' times.

                    ALVY
                     (Moving down the hallway to 
               the bathroom) 
          Darling, darling, I've been killing 
          spiders since I was thirty, okay?

                    ANNIE
                     (Upset, hands on her neck) 
          Oh.  What?

                    ALVY 
               (Coming back into the living room) 
          Very big spider.

                    ANNIE
                Yeah?

                    ALVY
                Two ... Yeah.  Lotta, lotta trouble. 
          There's two of 'em. 

Alvy starts walking down the ball again, Annie following.

                    ANNIE
                Two?

                    ALVY
                      (Opening a closet door) 
          Yep.  I didn't think it was that big, 
          but it's a major spider.  You got a 
          broom or something with a-

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, I-I left it at your house.

                    ALVY
                     (Overlapping) 
          -snow shovel or anything or something.

                    ANNIE
                     (Overlapping) 
          I think I left it there, I'm sorry.

Reaching up into the closet, Alvy takes out a covered tennis racquet.

                    ALVY
                     (Holding the racquet) 
          Okay, let me have this.

                    ANNIE
                Well, what are you doing ... what are 
          you doing with-

                    ALVY
                Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom 
          the size of a Buick.

He walks into the bathroom, Annie looking after him.

                    ANNIE
                Well, okay.  Oooh.

Alvy stands in the middle of the bathroom, tennis racquet in one band, rolled
magazine in the other.  He looks over at the shelf above the sink and picks up 
a small container.  He holds it out, shouting off screen to Annie.

                    ALVY 
          Hey, what is this?  You got black soap?
  
                    ANNIE
                     (Off screen) 
          It's for my complexion.

                    ALVY
                Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show?  
          Geez. 
               (Alvy turns and starts swapping 
               the racquet over the shelf, knocking 
               down articles and breaking glass) 
          Don't worry! 
               (He continues to swat the racquet 
               all over the bathroom.  He finally 
               moves out of the room, hands close 
               to his body.  He walks into the 
               other room, where Annie is sitting 
               in a corner of her bed leaning against 
               the wall) 
          I did it!  I killed them both.  What-what's 
          the matter?  Whatta you- 
               (Annie is sobbing, her band over 
               her face)
          -whatta you sad about?  You- What'd you 
          want me to do?  Capture 'em and rehabilitate 
          'em?

                    ANNIE
                     (Sobbing and taking Alvy's arm) 
          Oh, don't go, okay?  Please.
     
                    ALVY
                     (Sitting down next to her) 
          Whatta you mean, don't go?  Whatta-whatta
          -what's the matter?  Whatta you expecting
          -termites?  What's the matter?

                    ANNIE
                     (Sobbing) 
          Oh, uh, I don't know.  I miss you.  Tsch.

She beats her fist on the bed.  Reacting, Alvy puts his arm around her shoulder
and leans back against the wall.

                    ALVY
                Oh, Jesus, really?

                    ANNIE
                     (Leaning on his shoulder) 
          Oh, yeah.  Oh. 
               (They kiss) 
          Oh!  Alvy?

                    ALVY 
          What?

He touches her face gently as she wipes tears from her face.

                    ANNIE
                Was there somebody in your room when 
          I called you?

                    ALVY
                W-w-whatta you mean?

                    ANNIE
                I mean was there another- I thought I 
          heard a voice.

                    ALVY
          Oh, I had the radio on.

                    ANNIE
          Yeah?

                    ALVY
          I'm sorry.  I had the television set 
          ... I had the television-

                    ANNIE
          Yeah.

Alvy pulls her to him and they kiss again.

                                        CUT TO:

INT. ALVY'S BED

Alvy is lying in bed next to Annie, who is leaning on her elbow looking down 
at him.  He rubs her arms and she smiles.

                    ANNIE
                Alvy, let's never break up again.  I don't 
          wanna be apart.

                    ALVY 
          Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too 
          mature for something like that.

                    ANNIE
                Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?

                    ALVY
                It's all right for me, it's been terrific, 
          you know?  Better than either one of my 
          marriages.  See, 'cause. . . 'cause there's 
          just something different about you.  I 
          don't know what it is, but it's great.

                    ANNIE 
               (Snickering) 
          You know I think that if you let me, maybe 
          I could help you have more fun, you know?  
          I mean, I know it's hard and ... Yeah.

                    ALVY 
          I don't know.

                    ANNIE 
          Alvy, what about ... what if we go away 
          this weekend, and we could-

                    ALVY
                Tsch, why don't we get ... why don't 
          we get Rob, and the three of us'll 
          drive into Brooklyn, you know, and 
          we show you the old neighborhood.

                    ANNIE
                Okay, okay.  Okay.

                    ALVY
                That'd be fun for yuh.  Don't you think-

                    ANNIE
                Yeah.

Alvy raises up his head and they kiss.

EXT. HIGHWAY

Annie is behind the wheel in her VW, Rob is beside her, Alvy in the back seat
leaning forward so that his head is between them.  They're driving down the 
highway.

                    ANNIE
                -me, my God, it's a great day!

                    ALVY 
               (Interrupting) 
          Hey, can yuh watch the road?  Watch the --
 
                    ROB
                     (Overlapping) 
          Yeah, watch the road!

                    ALVY 
          You'll total the whole car.

                    ANNIE
                     (Laughing) 
          Hey, you know, I never even visited 
          Brooklyn before.

                    ROB
                I can't wait to see the old neighborhood.

                    ALVY
                Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.

                    ROB
                We can show her the schoolyard.

                    ALVY
                Right.  I was a great athlete.  Tell 
          her, Max, I was the best, I was all 
          schoolyard.

                    ROB 
          Yes, I remember. 
               (Annie laughs) 
          He was all schoolyard.  They threw him 
          a football once, he tried to dribble it.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK.

Alvy Annie and Rob move toward the roller coaster on the screen.  The area's 
deserted.  Sea gulls are heard.

                    ALVY 
          Oh, look, look, there's that ... that's
          -that's my old house.  That's where I 
          used to live.

                    ANNIE
                     (Laughing) 
          Holy cow!

                    ROB
                You're lucky, Max-where I used to live 
          is now a pornographic equipment store.

Annie laughs.

                    ALVY 
          I have some very good memories there.

                    ROB
                What kind of good memories, Max?  
          Your mother and father fighting all 
          the time.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, and always over the most 
          ridiculous things.

FLASHBACK - INT. ALVY'S HOUSE.

Alvy's father sits in his chair.  His mother is polishing a door while Alvy 
lies on the floor playing.  Annie, adult Alvy and Rob quietly walk into the 
scene to watch.

                    ALVY'S FATHER
          You fired the cleaning woman?

                    ALVY'S MOTHER
          She was stealing.

                    ALVY'S FATHER
          But she's colored.

                    ALVY'S MOTHER
                SO?

                    ALVY'S FATHER
          So the colored have enough trouble.

                    ALVY'S MOTHER
          She was going through my pocketbook!

                    ALVY'S FATHER
          They're persecuted enough!

                    ALVY'S MOTHER
          Who's persecuting?  She stole!

Alvy's father gets up and gets his hard hat.  He sits back down and starts 
polishing it.

                    ALVY'S FATHER
                All right-so we can afford it.

                    ALVY'S MOTHER
                How can we afford it?  On your pay?  
          What if she steals more?

                    ALVY'S FATHER
                She's a colored woman, from Harlem!  
          She has no money!  She's got a right 
          to steal from us!  After all, who is 
          she gonna steal from if not us?

                    ADULT ALVY
                     (Yelling into the scene) 
          You're both crazy!  

                    ROB
                They can't hear you, Max.

                    ALVY'S MOTHER
                Leo ... I married a fool!

                    ROB
               (Pointing) 
          Hey, Max!  Who's that?

As the three friends watch Alvy's old living room, the scene has suddenly 
shifted.  A huge crowd stands around the room, laughing, eating, chatting and 
vibrating with the turns of the roller-coaster ride.

                    ALVY
                It-it-it's the welcome-home party 
          in nineteen forty-five, for my cousin 
          Herbie.

                    ADULT ALVY
                     (Pointing) 
          Look, look, there's-there's that one 
          over there, that's Joey Nichols, he 
          was my- 
               (Young Alvy stands next to Joey 
               Nichols, who's sitting in one of 
               the easy chairs.  They smile at 
               each other; people and noise all 
               around)
          -father's friend.  He was always bothering 
          me when I was a kid.

                    JOEY
                Joey Nichols. 
               (Laughing) 
          See.  Nichols.  See, Nichols! 
               (Joey shows young Alvy his cuff 
               links and a tie pin, which are 
               made from nickels, as Alvy stands
               with hands on hips, unconcerned.  
               Joey then slaps his band to his 
               forehead and puts a nickel on 
               his forehead) 
          Yuh see, nickels!  You can always 
          remember my name, just think of Joey 
          Five Cents. 
               (Laughing) 
          That's me.  Joey Five Cents!

Joey grabs Alvy's cheeks and pinches them.

                    YOUNG ALVY
                     (Turning away) 
          What an asshole!

A group of women stands near a buffet table eating and listening to Alvy 
mother and her sister, Tessie, and a young girl, as the three friends watch.

                    ALVY'S MOTHER
                I was always the sister with good common 
          sense.  But Tessie was always the one 
          with personality.  When she was younger, 
          they all wanted to marry Tessie.

She touches Tessie's shoulder.  Tessie starts to laugh.

                    ADULT ALVY
                     (Pointing, to Rob) 
          Do you believe that, Max?  Tessie 
          Moskowitz had the personality.  She's 
          the life of the ghetto, no doubt.

                    ALVY'S MOTHER
                     (To the young girl) 
          She was once a great beauty.

Tessie nods her head "yes."

                    ROB 
          Tessie, they say you were the sister 
          with personality.

                    TESSIE
                     (Addressing the young girl) 
          I was a great beauty.

                    ROB
                Uh, how did this personality come about?

                    TESSIE
                     (Grabbing the young girl's cheek) 
          I was very charming.

                    ROB
                There were many men interested in you?

                    TESSIE
                     (To the young girl) 
          Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.

Tessie gyrates back and forth imitating a dancer while Annie and the adult 
Alvy lean on each other laughing.

                    ROB
                     (Laughing) 
          That's pretty hard to believe.

EXT. STREET.

Alvy and Annie walk contentedly down a street; Alvy's arm is draped around 
Annie.  People walk by them on the street as they move toward their apartment
building.

                    ANNIE
                Well, I had a really good day, you know 
          that?  It was just a real fine way to 
          spend my birthday.

                    ALVY 
          Ah?  Oh, well, your birthday's not till 
          tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah, but it's real close.

                    ALVY
                Yeah, but no presents till midnight.

                    ANNIE
                     (Laughing) 
          Oh, darn it.

INT. APARTMENT

Annie and Alvy sit on the sofa.  Annie's unwrapping a gift while Alvy watches.

                    ANNIE
                     (Making sounds) 
          This is-
               (Making sounds)
          Huh?

She pulls out flimsy black lingerie from the box.

                    ALVY
          Happy birthday.

                    ANNIE
          What is this? Is this a...Present?
               (Laughing)
          Are you kidding?

                    ALVY
                Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?

                    ANNIE 
          Uh, yeah, uh ... t-t-this is more like 
          a present for you, yeah, but it's-

                    ALVY 
          Try it ... it'll add years to our 
          sex life.

                    ANNIE
                     (Looking up at Alvy and laughing) 
          Uh huh.  Yeah.  Forget it. 

Alvy leans over and hands her another box as she puts down the lingerie.

                    ALVY 
          Here's a real present.

                    ANNIE
                     (Opening the gift) 
          What... huh?

                    ALVY  
          Check it out.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, yeah?  What is this, anyway?
               (continuing) 
          Let me see.  Okay, let's... oooh, God! 
               (She takes out a watch from the box) 
          Oh, you knew I wanted this ... 
               (Laughing) 
          God, it's terrific, God!

                    ALVY
                     (Making sounds) 
          Yeah, I know.  Just-just put on the 
          watch, and-and ... that thing, and 
          we'll just ...

                    ANNIE
                     (Laughing) 
          Oh!  My God! 
               (Making sounds)

Alvy kisses Annie.

INT. NIGHT CLUB.

Annie, spotlighted onstage, stands in front of the microphone, smiling.  She 
looks downward and sings "Seems Like Old Times.  " The audience applauds 
loudly as the music fades out.

                    ANNIE
                     (Laughing) 
          Thank you.

Alvy sits at the bar, clapping and staring at Annie as she walks over to him 
and sits down.  The low murmur of the night club is surrounding them.

                    ALVY
                     (Reacting) 
          You were-you were sensational.  I mean, 
          I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck 
          to it, you would be great, and-and, you 
          know, I-I-you-you were sensational.

                    ANNIE 
               (Looking at Alvy, smiling) 
          Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were 
          just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, 
          it makes it really easy for me, because I 
          can be ... huh?

Tony, a famous record personality, pushes through the crowd, moving toward 
Alvy and Annie.  An entourage follows him as he makes his way to their table. 

TONY 
          Excuse me.

He shakes hands with Annie, smiling.

                    ANNIE 
                Oh.

                    TONY 
          Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.

                    ANNIE
                Well, hi!

                    TONY
          Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say 
          that we really enjoyed your sets.

                    ANNIE
               (Laughing) 
          Oh, yeah, really, oh!

                    TONY
          I though it was ... very musical, and I 
          liked it a lot.

                    ANNIE
                Oh, neat ... oh, that's very nice, 
          gosh, thanks a lot.

                    TONY 
          Are you ... are you recording?  Or do- 
          Are you with any label now?

                    ANNIE
                     (Laughing) 
          No, no, no, not at all.

                    TONY  
                Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about 
          that sometime, if you get a chance.

Seated Alvy looks the other way, reacting.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh.  What about?

                    TONY   
          ... of possibly working together.

                    ANNIE 
               (Looking for the first time at Alvy) 
          Well, hey, that's, that's nice.  Uh. 
          Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer.  
          Do you know Alvy?  Uh ... and ... uh ... 
          Tony Lacey.

                    TONY
                No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know 
          your work.  I'm a big fan of yours.

Tony reaches over and shakes hands with Alvy.  The nightclub crowd surrounds 
them all with their low chatter and cigarette smoke.

                    ALVY 
          Thank you very much.  It's a pleasure.

                    TONY
                     (Turning to introduce his entourage) 
          This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh ... Bob and 
          Petronia.

                    ANNIE
                Hi.

                    ENTOURAGE 
          Hi.

                    ANNIE
                     (Laughing) 
          Hi, hi, Bob ...

                    TONY 
          Uh ... w-we're going back to the Pierre.  
          We're staying at the Pierre ... and we're 
          gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a 
          drink there, and ... if you'd like to come, 
          uh, we'd love to have you.

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah.

                    TONY
                And we could just sit and talk ... nothing.  
          Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just 
          be very mellow.

Annie and Tony and his entourage turn to look at Alvy.

                    ALVY 
               (Fingers to his mouth, reacting) 
          Remember, we had that thing.

                    ANNIE
                What thing?

                    ALVY
                     (Staring at Annie and clearing 
               his throat) 
          Don't you remember we-we-we discussed 
          that thing that we were-

                    ANNIE 
               (Overlapping) 
          Thing?

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping) 
          -yes, we had, uh ...

                    ANNIE 
               (Looking at Alvy, reacting) 
          Oh, the thing!  Oh, the thing ... 
               (Laughing) 
          ... yeah ... yeah.

Annie turns, looks at Tony as he smiles and gestures with his hands.

                    TONY 
          Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, 
          we can't do it now ... that's fine, 
          too.  W-w-w-we'll do it another time.

                    ANNIE
                Hey-

                    TONY 
          Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get 
          together and ... and we'll meet there.

He shakes hands with Annie.

                    ANNIE 
               (Reacting) 
          Oh.

                    TONY
                It was a wonderful set.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, gosh.

                    TONY 
               (Smiling) 
          I really enjoyed it. 
               (Looking at Alvy) 
          Nice to have metcha.  Good night.

                    ENTOURAGE 
          Bye-bye.

                    ANNIE 
          Nice to see you ... bye.  Yeah.  Bye. 

She turns and looks at Alvy.

                    ALVY 
               (Reacting) 
          What's ... you ... well, what's the 
          matter, You w-wanna go to that party?

                    ANNIE 
               (Looking down at her hands, 
               then up at Alvy) 
          I don't know, I thought it might be kind 
          of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be 
          nice to meet some new people.

                    ALVY
                     (Sighing) 
          I'm just not ... you know, I don't think 
          I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I 
          don't respond well to mellow, you know 
          what I mean, I-I have a tendency to ... 
          if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then 
          rot.  You know, and it's-it's not good 
          for my ... 
               (Making sounds)

                    ANNIE 
          All right, all right, you don't wanna go 
          to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?

INT. MOVIE THEATER.

The screen is projecting the beginning of "The Sorrow and the Pity": a street 
filled with fleeing cars, belongings tied on top and piled in the back seats. 
Subtitles pop on:

"The Jewish warmongers and
Parisian plutocrats tried
to flee with their gold and jewels"

as a narrator explains in German.

                                        CUT TO.

Split screen: Annie and her psychiatrist on the left; Alvy and his on the 
right. Annie, talking, sits in a white molded chair, as does her doctor.  
The office is very modern: stark, white and chrome. Alvy, talking to his 
psychiatrist, lies on a deep leather sofa, the doctor seated away from him.  
This office looks more like a well-worn den: bookcases overflowing, dark wood.
The dialogue is separated in each screen, though no one talks simultaneously.

                    ANNIE
                     (To her doctor) 
          That day in Brooklyn was the last day 
          I remember really having a great time.

                    ALVY 
               (To his doctor) 
          Well, we never have any laughs anymore, 
          is the problem.

                    ANNIE 
          Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.

                    ALVY'S PSYCHIATRIST
                How often do you sleep together?

                    ANNIE'S PSYCHIATRIST 
          Do you have sex often?

                    ALVY 
          Hardly ever.  Maybe three times a week.

                    ANNIE 
          Constantly!  I'd say three times a week.  
          Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have 
          sex.

                    ALVY 
          She would not sleep with me the other 
          night, you know, it's-

                    ANNIE 
          And ... I don't know ... I mean, six months 
          ago I-I woulda done it.  I woulda done it, 
          just to please him.

                    ALVY 
          I mean ... I tried everything, you know, 
          I-I-I put on soft music and my-my red light 
          bulb, and ...

                    ANNIE
                But the thing is-I mean, since our 
          discussions here, I feel I have a right 
          to my own feelings.  I think you woulda 
          been happy because ... uh, uh, I really 
          asserted myself.

                    ALVY 
          The incredible thing about it is, I'm 
          paying for her analysis and she's making 
          progress and I'm getting screwed.

                    ANNIE 
          I don't know, though, I feel so guilty 
          because Alvy is paying for it, so, you 
          know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go 
          to bed with him.  But if I do go to bed 
          with him, it's like I'm going against my 
          own feelings.  I don't know I-I can't win.

                    ALVY 
               (Simultaneously, with Annie) 
          You know ... it's getting expensive
          ...my analyst ... for her analyst.  She-
          she's making progress and I'm not making 
          any progress.  Her progress is defeating 
          my progress.

                    ANNIE
               (Simultaneously, with Alvy) 
          Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I 
          should just live with a woman.

                                        CUT TO:

INT. APARTMENT

Alvy and Annie sit close together on the sofa in some friends' apartment. 
Their friends, another couple, stand behind the sofa in the background. 
Excited, they talk almost all at once.

                    WOMAN FRIEND 
          Wow, I don't believe it ... you mean to 
          tell me you guys have never snorted coke?

                    ANNIE 
          Well, I always wanted to try, you know, 
          but, uh, Alvy, uh ... he's very down on it.

                    ALVY 
          Hey, don't put it on me.  You kn- Wh-what 
          is it, I don't wanna put a wad of white 
          powder in my nose 'cause the-the nasal 
          membranes ...

They all start talking at once.

                    ANNIE 
          You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.

                    ALVY 
               (Counting on his fingers) 
          How can you say that?  I mean, 
               (Making sounds) 
          who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that 
          girl from your acting class should sleep 
          together in a threesome.

                    ANNIE 
               (Reacting) 
          That's sick!

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new.  
          You know, you didn't say it couldn't be 
          sick.

Annie laughs, chatters.

                    WOMAN FRIEND 
          Just come on, Alvy. 
               (All four are now sitting on the 
               sofa. The male friend starts to 
               prepare lines of cocaine; Alvy 
               and Annie look at each other, 
               reacting) 
          Do your body a favor.  Try it, come on.

                    ALVY 
          Oh, yeah?

                    ANNIE
                Yeah.  Come on.  It'd be fun.

                    ALVY 
               (Moving forward on the couch) 
          Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause 
          the Incas did it, you know, and-and 
          they-they-they were a million laughs.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Alvy, come on, for your own experience.  
          I mean, you wanna write, why not?

                    MALE FRIEND 
          It's great stuff, Alvy.  Friend of mine 
          just brought it in from California.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, do you know something-I didn't tell 
          yuh, we're going to California next week.

                    GIRL 
          Oh, really?

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah ...

                    ALVY  
                ... I'm thrilled.  As you know, uh ... 
          uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, 
          and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.

                    ANNIE 
               (Interrupting) 
          No, no, no that's not it at all.  Alvy's 
          giving an award on television.  Gee, he 
          talks like he's violating a moral issue 
          sitting here.

                    GIRL 
          You're kidding?

                    ALVY 
          It's so phony, and we have to leave New 
          York during Christmas week, which really 
          kills me.

                    MAN 
               (Interrupting) 
          Alvy, listen, while you're in California, 
          could you possibly score some coke for me?

Annie laughs.

                    ALVY 
               (Over Annie's laughter) 
          Sure, sure, I'll be glad to. I-I'll just 
          put it in a-a-a h-h-hollow heel that I 
          have in my boot, you know. 
               (Alvy picks up the small open 
               gold case of cocaine base the man 
               placed on the coffee table and
               looks at it, reacting) 
          H-h-how much is this stuff?

                    MAN 
          It's about two thousand dollars an ounce.

                    ANNIE 
          God.

                    ALVY
                Really?  And what is the kick of it?  
          Because I never ...

He puts his finger into the drug, smells it and then sneezes.  The powder 
blows all over the room as the man, woman and Annie react silently.

                                        CUT TO:


CALIFORNIA. BEVERLY HILLS STREET-DAY

It's a warm, beautiful day.  Rob, Annie and Alvy in Rob's convertible are 
moving past the spacious houses, the palm trees.  The sunlight reflects off 
the car.  Annie, excited, is taking the whole place in.  Background voices 
sing Christmas carols.

                    VOICES
               (Singing) 
          We wish you a Merry Christmas,
          We wish you a Merry Christmas, 
          We wish you a Merry Christmas, 
          And a -Happy New Year.

                    ROB 
               (Over the singing) 
          I've never been so relaxed as I have 
          been since I moved out here, Max.  I 
          want you to see my house.  I live 
          right next to Hugh Hefner's house, Max.  
          He lets me use the Jacuzzi.  And the 
          women, Max, they're like the women in 
          Playboy magazine, only they can move 
          their arms and legs.

                    ANNIE
                     (Laughing) 
          You know, I can't get over that this is 
          really Beverly Hills.

                    VOICES 
               (Singing) 
          We wish you a Merry Christmas,
          And a Happy New Year.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, the architecture is really consistent, 
          isn't it?  French next to-

                    VOICES 
               (Singing over the dialogue)
          Oh, Christmas ... tree,
          Oh, Christmas tree,
          How bright and green
          Our ...

                    ALVY
          -Spanish, next to Tudor, next to Japanese.

                    ANNIE 
          God, it's so clean out here.

                    ALVY 
          It's that they don't throw their garbage 
          away.  They make it into television shows.

                    ROB 
          Aw, come on, Max, give us a break, will 
          yuh?  It's Christmas. 

Annie starts snapping pictures of the view.

                    ALVY 
          Can you believe this is Christmas here?

                    VOICES 
               (Singing) 
          Oh Christmas tree,
          Oh Christmas tree ...

They pass a large house with spacious lawn.  Sitting on the lawn is a Santa 
Claus complete with sleigh and reindeer.  Voices continue to sing Christmas 
carols; Annie continues to take pictures.

                    ANNIE
          You know, it was snowing-it was snowing 
          and really gray in New York yesterday.

                    ROB 
          No kidding?

                    ALVY 
          Right-well, Santa Claus will have 
          sunstroke.

                    ROB 
          Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.

                    ALVY 
          There's no economic crime, you know, 
          but there's-there's ritual, religious-
          cult murders, you know, there's wheat-
          germ killers out here.

                    ROB 
          While you're out here, Max, I want you 
          to see some of my TV show.  And we're 
          invited to a big Christmas party.

They continue driving, now in a less residential area, passing a hot-dog stand.
"Tail-Pup" concession; people mill about eating hot dogs.

                    VOICES 
               (Singing, louder now)
          Remember Christ our Savior
          Was born on Christmas day
          To save us all ... from Satan's power
          As we were gone astray.

They pass a theater, the marquee announcing "House of Exorcism Messiah of Evil.
Rated R.  Starts at 7:15."

INT. TV CONTROL ROOM.

Several monitors line the wall in front of an elaborate console.  Rob and Alvy,
along with Charlie, the technician, stand in the small room watching the 
screens showing Rob as a television star on a situation comedy.  They chatter, 
analyzing the footage, over the sounds of the taped television comedy.

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping the chatter) 
          Oh.

                    ROB 
          Look, now, Charlie, give me a big 
          laugh here.

                    ROB ON TV SCREEN 
          A limousine to the track breakdown?

                    ROB
                     (Watching) 
          A little bigger.

TV monitors go black as the technician turns of the monitors to fix the laugh 
track.

                    ALVY 
          Do you realize how immoral this all is?

                    ROB
                Max, I've got a hit series.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake 
          laughs.

Technicians turn the monitors back on, showing Rob on the screen with another 
character, Arnie.

                    ARNIE 
          Oh, I'm sorry.

                    ROB ON TV SCREEN 
          Arnie.

                    ARNIE 
          Yeah.

                    ROB 
               (Turning to the technician) 
          Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.

                    ALVY 
          Look, uh ...

Loud laughter from the TV monitors.

                    ROB 
               (To Alvy) 
          We do the show live in front of an 
          audience.

                    ALVY 
          Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause 
          your jokes aren't funny.

                    ROB 
          Yeah, well, that's why this machine 
          is dynamite.

                    ROB ON TV SCREEN 
          You better lie down.  You've been in 
          the sun too long.

                    ROB 
               (To the technician) 
          Yeah ... uh, now give me a like a 
          medium-size chuckle here ... and 
          then a big hand.

The sounds of laughter and applause are heard from the TV.

                    ALVY
               (Removing his glasses and 
               rubbing his face) 
          Is there booing on there?

The monitors show a woman on the screen.

                    WOMAN 
          We were just gonna fix you up with my 
          cousin Dolores.

                    ALVY 
               (Overlapping the TV) 
          Oh, Max, I don't feel well.

                    ROB 
          What's the matter?

                    ALVY 
          I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy... 
               (Coughing) 
          I feel dizzy, Max.

                    ROB 
          Well, sit down.

                    ALVY 
               (Sitting down) 
          Oh, Jesus.

                    ROB 
          You all right?

                    ALVY 
          I don't know, I mean, I-

                    ROB 
               (Crouching before Alvy, looking 
               at him) 
          You wanna lie down?

                    ALVY 
          No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt 
          queasy all morning.  I just started 
          getting ...

                    ROB 
          How about a ginger ale?

                    ALVY 
          Oh, Max ... no, I maybe I better lie 
          down.

INT. HOTEL ROOM.

Alvy lies in bed, one elbow propped up, a doctor sitting next to him looking 
concerned.  The doctor bolds out a plate of chicken; Alvy listlessly stares at 
it. Annie, in the background, is on the phone.

                    ANNIE 
               (Talking into the phone) 
          Yes.

                    DOCTOR 
               (Holding out the food) 
          Why don't you just try to get a little 
          of this down?  This is just plain chicken.

                    ALVY
               (Taking a piece of chicken and 
               holding it) 
          Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this.  
          I'm nauseous. 
               (He gasps and makes sounds) 
          If you could-if you could just give me 
          something to get me through the next two 
          hours, you know I-I have to go out to 
          Burbank ... and give out an award on a 
          TV show.

                    ANNIE 
               (On the phone, overlapping the 
               doctor and Alvy) 
          Well ... H-h huh ... Oh, good ... Yes, 
          I'll tell him.

                    DOCTOR 
          Well, there's nothing wrong with you 
          actually, so far as I can tell.  I mean, 
          you have no fever, no ... no symptoms 
          of anything serious.  You haven't been 
          eating pork or shellfish.

Annie bangs up and moves over to Alvy.

                    ANNIE 
               (Sitting on the edge of the bed) 
          Excuse me.  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor.  
          Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show.  They 
          said everything is fine.  They found a 
          replacement, so they're going to tape 
          without you.

                    ALVY
               (Making sounds) 
          I'm nauseous.
               (He sighs and gasps)
          Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the 
          TV show?

Reacting, Alvy puts up his band in disgust, then starts eating the piece of 
chicken he has been holding.  The doctor and Annie watch him, reacting.

                    ANNIE
                Yeah.  Listen, Doctor, I'm worried.

                    DOCTOR 
          Now, Mrs. Singer, I can't find anything --

                    ALVY 
          Christ!

                    ANNIE 
          Nothing at all?

                    DOCTOR 
          No, I think I can get a lab man up here.

                    ALVY  
               (Grabbing the rest of the chicken 
               from the plate) 
          Oh, jesus. Can I have the salt, please?

                    ANNIE 
          What do you mean?  Do you think he's-

                    DOCTOR 
               (Handing the salt to Alvy) 
          Yes, excuse me. 
               (To Annie) 
          Perhaps it would be even better if we 
          took him to the hospital for a day or two.

Alvy begins to eat.

                    ANNIE 
          Uh-huh ... Oh, hospital?

                    DOCTOR 
          Well, otherwise, there's no real way to 
          tell what's going on. 

                    ALVY 
               (Making sounds, gasping) 
          This is not bad, actually.

EXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREET RESIDENTIAL AREA - DAY

Rob, Annie and Alvy in Rob's car pull into a long circular driveway as an 
attendant walks over to the car.  A sprawling house is seen to the right; a 
couple moves toward the front door, and the driveway is crowded with other 
parked cars.  Loud music is heard.

                    ALVY 
               (Getting out of the car) 
          Hey, don't tell me we're gonna hafta 
          walk from the car to the house.  Geez, 
          my feet haven't touched pavement since 
          I reached Los Angeles.

INT. HOUSE

A Hollywood Christmas party is in session, complete with music, milling people,
circulating waiters bolding out trays of drinks.  It's all very casual. French 
doors run the entire width of one wall; they are opened to the back lawn, 
guests move from the room to outside and back in.  It is crowded; bits of 
conversation and clinking glasses can be heard.  Two men, California-tanned, 
stand by the French doors talking.

                    1ST MAN 
          Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll 
          take a meeting with you if you'll take 
          a meeting with Freddy.

                    2ND MAN 
          I took a meeting with Freddy.  Freddy 
          took a meeting with Charlie.  You take 
          a meeting with him.

                    1ST MAN 
          All the good meetings are taken.

                                        CUT TO:

FULL GROUP SHOT

A man stands talking, people in groups behind him.  Two born like gadgets are 
attached to his shoulders; he's wearing a bizarre space costume.

                    3RD MAN 
          Right now it's only a notion, but I 
          think I can get money to make it into 
          a concept ... and later turn it into 
          an idea.

                                        CUT TO:

Alvy and Rob stand near the French doors leading to the back lawn, eating and 
drinking and watching the people walking in and out of the house.

                    ROB 
          You like this house, Max?

                    ALVY 
          M'hm.

                    ROB 
          I even brought a road map to get us to 
          the bathroom.

                    ALVY 
          Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony 
          Lacey's party.

                    ROB 
          What difference does that make?

Alvy looks into the room, where Annie and Tony Lacey are having an animated 
conversation.

ALVY 
          I think he has a little thing for Annie.

                    ROB 
          Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max.  He 
          goes with that girl over there.

                    ALVY 
          Where?

Rob nods his head toward a tall woman dressed all in white conversing with a 
group of people close-by.

                    ROB 
          The one with the V.P.L.

                    ALVY 
          V.P.L.?

                    ROB 
          Visible panty line.  Max, she is gorgeous.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great 
          for you because you're -you're used to 
          twos, aren't you?

                    ROB 
          There are no twos, Max.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, you're used to the kind with the-
          with the shopping bags walking through 
          Central Park with the surgical masks 
          on muttering.

                    ROB 
          M'hm.

                    ALVY 
          And ... uh-

                    ROB 
               (Interrupting) 
          How do you like this couple, Max?

A couple moves over toward Rob and Alvy.  The man's arm is around the woman; 
they stand very close.  In the background, Annie and Tony are still talking.

                    ROB 
          And I think they just came back from 
          Masters and Johnson.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, intensive care ward. 
               (Watching the woman in white) 
          My God-hey, Max, I think she's ... I 
          think she's giving me the eye. 

As Rob and Alvy observe the guests, the woman in white starts walking toward 
them.

                    ROB 
          If she comes over here, Max, my brain 
          is going to turn into guacamole.

                    ALVY
                I'll handle it.  I'll handle it.  Hi.

                    GIRL IN WHITE  
          You're Alvy Singer, right?  Didn't 
          we meet at EST?

                    ALVY 
               (Reacting) 
          EST?  No, no, I was never to est.

                    GIRL IN WHITE 
          Then how can you criticize it?

                    ALVY 
          Oh.

                    ROB 
          Oh, he-he didn't say anything.

                    ALVY 
               (Laughing) 
          No, no, I came out here to get some 
          shock therapy, but there was an energy 
          crisis, so I ... He's my-my food taster.  
          Have you two met?

                    ROB
               (Shaking his head) 
          Hi.  How do you do.

                    GIRL IN WHITE 
          Do you taste to see if the food's poisoned?

                    ALVY
                Yeah, he's crazy.

The girl in white laughs.

                    ALVY 
                     (Looking at Rob and the girl) 
          Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must 
          be in the stars.

                    ROB 
          Yeah.  Right.

                    ALVY 
          Uri Geller must be on the premises 
          someplace.

                    ROB 
          We're gonna operate together.

Rob and the girl walk of together as the camera moves in on Tony and Annie 
standing by the buffet table.

                    TONY 
          We just need about six weeks, in about 
          six weeks we could cut a whole album.

                    ANNIE
          I don't know, this is strange to me, 
          you know.

                    TONY
          just ... that's all you need.  You can 
          come and stay here.

                    ANNIE
          Oh.

                    TONY 
          There's a whole wing in this house.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Oh yeah, stay here?  U-huh.

                    TONY 
          You can have it to use.  Why-why are 
          you smiling?

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          I don't know.  I don't know.

She picks up an hors doeuvre.

                                        CUT TO:

The two men still talking about meetings surrounded by other groups of people 
milling about.

                    1ST MAN 
          Not only is he a great agent, but he 
          really gives good meetings.

                    2ND MAN   
          M'mm.

Tony, band in band with the girl in white, is leaving the party room with Alvy 
and Annie to show them the rest of the house.

                    TONY 
          This is a great house, really.  Everything.  
          Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts.  
          You know who the original owners were?  
          Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond.  Then 
          you know who lived here?

                    ALVY 
          Trigger.

Annie and the girl in white laugh.

                    TONY 
          Charlie Chaplin.

                    ALVY 
          Hey.

                    TONY 
          Right before his un-American thing.

They stop in a den-like screening room.  A man is slouched back on one of the 
comfortable sofas that fill the room.  It is much quieter in here; a contrast 
to the noise and crowd downstairs.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, this place is great.

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah.

                    TONY 
          Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still 
          New Yorkers.

                    ALVY  
          Yeah, I love it there.

                    ANNIE 
               (Laughing) 
          Yeah.

                    TONY 
          Well, I used to live there.  I used to 
          live there for years.  You know, but 
          it's gotten-it's so dirty now.

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah.

                    ALVY 
          I'm into garbage.  It's my thing.

                    ANNIE 
          Boy, this is really a nice screening 
          room.  It's really a nice room.

                    TONY 
          Oh, and there's another thing about New 
          York.  See ... you-you wanna see a movie, 
          you have to stand in a long line.

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah.

                    TONY
                It could be freezing, it could be raining.

                    ANNIE 
          Yeah.

                    TONY
          And here, you just-

                    GIRL IN WHITE 
          We saw "Grand Illusion" here last night.

                    ALVY AND ANNIE 
               (In unison) 
          Oh, yeah?

                    MAN ON THE SOFA 
               (Looking over his shoulder at 
               the group) 
          That's a great film if you're high. 
               (The group laughs, looking down 
               at the man on the sofa. He looks 
               up at them, smiling, a joint in 
               his hand, and offers them a cigarette) 
          Hey, you.

                    TONY 
               (Shaking his head no) 
          Come and see our bedroom.  We did a 
          fantastic lighting job.  Okay?

                    ANNIE
                Oh, good.  Okay.

                    ALVY 
          I'm cool.

Tony and the girl in white leave the room, Annie and Alvy following.

                    ANNIE 
               (Taking Alvy's arm) 
          It's wonderful. I mean, you know they 
          just watch movies all day.

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, and gradually you get old and die.  
          You know it's important to make a little 
          effort once in a while.

                    ANNIE 
          Don't you think his girl friend's 
          beautiful?

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A 
          pat on the androgynous side.  But it's...

They pass a man talking on the phone in the hallway.

                    MAN ON THE PHONE 
          Yeah, yeah.  I forgot my mantra.

As they come down stairs the party is still in big gear.  People are looser 
now; conversations are more animated, some talk quietly in more intimate 
corners, some couples are dancing.  Alvy stands alone sipping a drink near the 
huge Christmas tree.  A tall woman, passing by, shakes his hand, then leaves. 
He continues to sip his drink, alone, watching Tony and Annie in the center of 
the room dancing.

The screen shows a plane in flight, Los Angeles far below, then:

                                        CUT TO:

AIRPLANE.  INT. AIRPLANE

Annie and Alvy sit, the stewardess behind them serving other passengers. Annie
stares out the window bolding a coffee cup; Alvy reads.  Both are preoccupied, 
thinking their own thoughts.

                    ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER 
               (To herself) 
          That was fun.  I don't think California 
          is bad at all.  It's a drag coming home.

                    ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
               (To himself) 
          Lotta beautiful women.  It was fun 
          to flirt.

                    ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER 
               (As she sips coffee) 
          I have to face facts. I-I adore Alvy, 
          but our relationship doesn't seem to 
          work anymore.

                    ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
               (An open magazine lies in 
               his lap) 
          I'll have the usual trouble with Annie 
          in bed tonight.  Whatta I need this?

                    ANNIE'S VOICE-OVER 
          If only I had the nerve to break up, 
          but it would really hurt him.

                    ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
          If only I didn't feel guilty asking 
          Annie to move out.  It'd probably 
          wreck her.  But I should be honest.

He looks over at Annie.

                    ANNIE 
               (Looking back at Alvy) 
          Alvy, uh, let's face it.  You know 
          something, don't think our relationship 
          is working.

                    ALVY 
          Tsch, I know.  A relationship, I think, 
          is-is like a shark, you know?  It has 
          to constantly move forward or it dies. 
               (He sighs) 
          And I think what we got on our hands 
               (Clearing his throat) 
          is a dead shark.

INT. ALVY'S LIVING ROOM-DAY

A lighted Christmas tree stands in the middle of boxes, books, and the general 
disarray of packing and figuring out what belongs to whom as Alvy helps Annie 
move out.

                    ALVY 
               (Holding up a book) 
          Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?

                    ANNIE 
               (Walking into the room with an 
               armload of books) 
          Well, let's see now ... If it has my 
          name on it, then I guess it's mine.

                    ALVY 
               (Reacting) 
          Oh, it sure has ... You know, you wrote 
          your name in all my books, 'cause you 
          knew this day was gonna come.

                    ANNIE 
               (Putting down the books and 
               flipping back her hair) 
          Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up 
          just as much as I do.

                    ALVY 
               (Riffling through the books) 
          There's no-no question in my mind.  I 
          think we're doing the mature thing, 
          without any doubt.

                    ANNIE 
               (Holding a framed picture and 
               moving about) 
          Now, look, all the books on death and 
          dying are yours and all the poetry books 
          are mine.

                    ALVY 
               (Looking down at a book) 
          This "Denial of Death".  You remember this?

                    ANNIE 
          Oh-

                    ALVY 
          This is the first book that I got you.

Annie goes over to Alvy.  They both look down at the book; the fireplace, 
burning nicely, is behind them.

                    ANNIE 
          -God.

                    ALVY 
          Remember that day?

                    ANNIE 
          Right.  Geez, I feel like there's a 
          great weight off my back.  M'mmm.

                    ALVY 
          Thanks, honey.

                    ANNIE 
               (Patting Alvy's shoulder) 
          Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  I mean, you 
          know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's 
          really important for us to explore new 
          relationships and stuff like that.

She walks away.

                    ALVY 
          There's no-there's no question about 
          that, 'cause we've given this ... uh, 
          uh, I think a more than fair shot, 
          you know?

He tosses the book into the carton.

                    ANNIE 
               (Off screen) 
          Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is 
          keen for me.

                    ALVY 
               (Off screen)  
          Yeah, and I-I tru-  you know, I trust 
          her, because my-my analyst recommended 
          her.

                    ANNIE 
               (Walking in with another 
               armload of books) 
          Well, why should I put you through all 
          my moods and hang-ups anyway?

                    ALVY 
          Right.  And you-and you know what the 
          beauty part is?

                    ANNIE 
          What?

                    ALVY 
               (Holding a small box of buttons) 
          We can always come back together again.  
          Because there's no-there's no problem.  
          'Cause ... Right.

                    ANNIE 
               (Overlapping) 
          Exactly, but ... exactly.  Ooooh!

                    ALVY 
          You know, I-I-I don't think many couples 
          could handle this.  You know, they could 
          just break up and remain friends.

                    ANNIE 
               (Taking a button from a box) 
          Hey, this one's mine, this button.
          This one, you rem-

                    ALVY 
               (Interrupting) 
          Yeah.

                    ANNIE 
          I guess these are all yours.  Impeach, uh, 
          Eisenhower ... Impeach Nixon ... Impeach 
          Lyndon Johnson ... Impeach Ronald Reagan.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET-DAY

People milling about on the sidewalk as Alvy walks out of a store and moves 
toward the foreground.

                    ALVY 
               (Into the camera, to the audience) 
          I miss Annie.  I made a terrible 
          mistake.

A couple, walking down the street, stops as the man talks to Alvy.

                    MAN ON THE STREET 
          She's living in Los Angeles with 
          Tony Lacey.

                    ALVY 
          Oh, yeah?  Well, if she is, then the 
          hell with her!  If she likes that 
          lifestyle, let her live there!  He's 
          a jerk, for one thing.

                    MAN ON THE STREET 
          He graduated Harvard.

                    ALVY
                Yeah. He may- Listen, Harvard makes 
          mistakes too, you know.  Kissinger 
          taught there.  

The couple strolls away as an older woman walks up to Alvy while others walk by.

                    OLD WOMAN 
          Don't tell me you're jealous?

                    ALVY 
          Yeah, jealous. A little bit like Medea. 
          Lemme, lemme-can I show you something, 
          lady? 
               (He takes a small item from his 
               pocket to show the woman) 
          What I have here ... I found this in the 
          apartment.  Black soap.  She used to wash 
          her face eight hundred times a day with 
          black soap. Don't ask me why.

                    OLD WOMAN 
          Well, why don't you go out with other 
          women?

                    ALVY 
          Well, I-I tried, but it's, uh, you know, 
          it's very depressing.

RECENT FLASHBACK - INT. ALVY'S COUNTRY KITCHEN

Alvy's arms and legs fill the screen as he slowly gets up from the floor 
bolding up a live lobster.  He puts it on a grill tray.

                    ALVY 
               (Pointing to the lobster) 
          This always happens to me.  Quick, g-go 
          get a broom. 

His date, a girl wearing short shorts, leans against the sink and lights a 
cigarette.  She makes no move to help.

                    GIRL DATE 
               (Smoking) 
          What are you making such a big deal about? 
               (As she talks, the lobster drops 
               from the tray to the floor.  Alvy 
               jumps away, then gingerly scrapes 
               the tray toward the lobster) 
          They're only lobsters.  Look, you're a 
          grown man, you know how to pick up a 
          lobster.

                    ALVY 
               (Looking up in stooped-over 
               position) 
          I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.

                    GIRL DATE 
               (Still leaning against the sink, 
               her hand on her hip) 
          Oh, when'd you quit smoking? 

He gets up of the floor with the lobster on the tray.

                    ALVY 
          Sixteen years ago.

                    GIRL DATE 
               (Puzzled) 
          Whatta you mean?  

                    ALVY 
               (Mocking) 
          Mean?

                    GIRL DATE 
          You stopped smoking sixteen years ago, 
          is that what you said?  Oh, I-I don't 
          understand.  Are you joking, or what?

                                        CUT TO:

A solitary Alvy walking along the FDR Drive where he had walked with Annie. - 
The New York skyline is still in the background, the sea gulls go by, the fog 
horn blows.  He walks slowly, moving off screen.

INT. ALVY'S BEDROOM - DAY

Alvy sits on his bed talking on the phone.

                    ALVY 
          Listen, honey, Central Park's turning 
          green ... Yeah, I sa-I saw that lunatic 
          that we-where we used to see ... with 
          the, uh, uh, pinwheel hat and, you know, 
          and the roller skates? . . . Listen, 
          I-I want you to come back here ... Well, 
          I-I-then I'm gonna come out there and 
          getcha.

                                        CUT TO:

An airborne plane.

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. LOS ANGELES AIRPORT.

People milling about as Alvy, in the outside phone-booth center, talks.

                    ALVY 
          Whatta you mean, where am I? Where do-
          where do you think I am?  I'm-I'm out 
          ... I'm at the Los Angeles Airport.  
          I flew in ... 
               (Sniffling) 
          Tsch, I-well, I flew in to see you ... 
               (Muttering) 
          Hey, listen, can we not debate this 
          on-on the telephone because I'm, you 
          know, I-I feel that I got a temperature 
          and I'm-I'm getting my-my chronic Los 
          Angeles nausea. I-I don't feel so good.

Alvy's conversation is still heard as the screen shows him behind the wheel of 
a car on a busy street; he causes a near-accident by jerking the car too slowly
toward an intersection.

                    ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
          Well, where-wherever you wanna meet, I 
          don't care.  I'll-I'll drive in.  I 
          rented a car I'm driving ... that ... 
          Whatta you mean?  What-why is that such 
          a miracle?  I'm driving myself --

EXT. OUTDOOR CAFƒ - DAY

People sit at umbrellaed tables with checkered tablecloths at a Sunset 
Boulevard outdoor cafe.  Street traffic goes by while they dine.  There's a 
mild California breeze.  The restaurant is somewhat crowded as Alvy makes his 
way around the tables looking about.  He finally sits down at an empty table; 
nearby sits a woman with a younger man.  A waitress brings Alvy a menu and 
waits for his order.

                    ALVY
               (To the waitress) 
          I'm gonna...I'm gonna have the alfalfa 
          sprouts and, uh, a plate of mashed yeast.

Annie, wearing a flowered dress and wide hat, moves into view.  Alvy,
noticing her, watches as she walks over to his table.  He rises and they shake 
hands.

                    ANNIE 
          Hi.

Alvy wipes at his nose as he stares.  He smiles, the street traffic moving 
behind him. Annie smiles back.

                    ALVY 
          You look very pretty.

                    ANNIE 
          Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, 
          that's all. 
               (Alvy adjusts his glasses, not 
               exactly knowing where to start;      
               a bit uneasy) 
          Well, you look nice.

                    ALVY 
               (Nodding his head) 
          You see, I-I've been thinking about it 
          and I think that we should get married.

                    ANNIE 
               (Adjusting her sunglasses) 
          Oh, Alvy, come on.

                    ALVY 
          Why?  You wanna live out here all year?  
          It's like living in Munchkin Land.

                    ANNIE 
               (Looking around) 
          Well, whatta you mean?  I mean, it's 
          perfectly fine out here.  I mean, Tony's 
          very nice and, uh, well, I meet people 
          and I go to parties and-and we play tennis.  
          I mean, that's ... that's a very big step 
          for me, you know?  I mean ... 
               (Reacting, Alvy looks down at 
               his hands, then up) 
          I'm able to enjoy people more.

                    ALVY 
               (Sadly) 
          So whatta you ... You're not gonna come 
          back to New York?

                    ANNIE 
               (Smiling) 
          What's so great about New York?  I mean, 
          it's a dying city.  You read "Death in 
          Venice."

                    ALVY 
          Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice"
          till I bought it for yuh.

                    ANNIE 
          That's right, that's right. 
               (Still smiling) 
          You only gave me books with the word 
          "death" in the titles.

                    ALVY 
               (Nodding his head and gesturing) 
          That's right, 'cause it's an important 
          issue.

                    ANNIE 
          Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, 
          you know that?  I mean, your life is New 
          York City.  You're just this person.  
          You're like this island unto yourself.

                    ALVY 
               (Toying with his car keys) 
          I can't enjoy anything unless I ... unless 
          everybody is.  I-you know, if one guy is 
          starving someplace, that's ... you know, 
          I-I ... it puts a crimp in my evening. 
               (Looking down at his hands, sadly) 
          So wanna get married or what?

                    ANNIE 
               (Seriously) 
          No. We're friends.  I wanna remain friends.

                    ALVY 
               (In disbelief) 
          Okay. 
               (Louder, to the waitress) 
          Check, please.  Can I -can I ... 
          Can I ... Can I ...

                    ANNIE 
               (Interrupting) 
          You're mad, aren't you?

                    ALVY 
               (Shaking his head) 
          No. 
               (Then nodding) 
          Yes, of course I'm mad, because you 
          love me, I know that.

                    ANNIE 
          Alvy, I can't say that that's true at 
          this point in my life.  I really just 
          can't say that that's true.  I mean, 
          you know how wonderful you are.  I 
          mean, you know ... you're the reason 
          that I got outta my room and that I 
          was able to sing, and-and-and, you know, 
          get more in touch with my feelings and 
          all that crap.  Anyway, look, I don't 
          wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh 
               (Laughing) 
          h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?

                    ALVY
               (Shrugging his shoulders) 
          The usual, you know. Uh, tryin't'write. 
          I'm workin' on a play. 
               (Sighing) 
          Jesus.  So whatta yuh saying?  That 
          you're not comin' back to New York with
          me?

He nods his head in disbelief.

                    ANNIE 
               (Nodding) 
          No! 
               (Pauses) 
          Look, I gotta go.

She starts to rise.

                    ALVY 
          You mean that ... 
               (He gets up and starts following 
               her past diners at other tables) 
          I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to 
          see you.

                    ANNIE 
          I'm late.

                    ALVY 
          Air miles, you know.  I mean, you 
          know what that does to my stomach?

They move down the steps of the cafe' toward the parking lot.

                    ANNIE 
          If you must know, it's a hectic time 
          for Tony.  The Grammys are tonight.

                    ALVY 
          The what?

                    ANNIE 
          The Grammys.  He's got a lotta records 
          up for awards.

                    ALVY 
          You mean they give awards for that 
          kind o' music?

                    ANNIE
                Oh!

                    ALVY 
          I thought just earplugs.

Annie gets into her car.  Alvy moves over to his rented convertible.

                    ANNIE 
          Just forget it, Alvy, okay?  Let's 
          just forget the conversation.

She closes the door, starts the motor.

                    ALVY
               (Yelling after her) 
          Awards! They do nothing but give out 
          awards!  I can't believe it.  Greatest, 
          greatest fascist dictator, Adolf Hitler!  

Annie drives away. Alvy gets behind the wheel, starts the motor. Putting the 
car in gear, he inadvertently moves forward, hitting a bunch of trash cans with
a loud crash. Putting the car in reverse, Alvy notices a beige car that has 
just turned into the parking lot. For a brief moment, the screen shows a 
flashback of the bumper-car ride at the Brooklyn amusement park.  Alvy's father
is on the Platform directing traffic; young Alvy is in a small car bumping 
others right and left.  Alvy, hack in the parking lot, backs up his convertible,
purposefully smashing the side of the beige car as another flashback of bumper-
car ride appears, this time-as, Alvy's father directs traffic-a Marine in a 
small car bits the back end of a soldier's car, and Alvy, back in the parking 
lot, moves his car over to another parked car and bits it full force.

Another flashback appears. people in the small cars really racing around the 
track now, bumping into one another over and over again, Alvy's father 
directing the flow, as the film cuts back to the parking lot, where Alvy 
reverses the convertible and rams it into the front end of yet another car.

He sits behind the wheel as people rush out of various cars and as sirens 
start blaring, coming closer and closer, stopping finally as a motorcycle cop 
gets off beside Alvy's car and walks over to him.

                    ALVY 
               (Getting out of the car) 
          Officer, I know what you're gonna say.  
          I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, 
          I-I have some problems with-with-with-

                    OFFICER 
               (Interrupting) 
          May I see your license, please?

                    ALVY 
          Sure. 
               (Searching, he finally fishes 
               his license out of his pocket) 
          just don't-don't get angry, you know 
          what I mean?  'Cause I-I have - I have 
          my-my license here.  You know, it's a 
          rented car.  And I've ...

He drops the license and it falls to the ground.

                    OFFICER
                Don't give me your life story 
               (Looking at the piece of paper 
               on the ground)
          -just pick up the license.

                    ALVY 
          Pick up the license.  You have to ask 
          nicely 'cause I've had an extremely 
          rough day.  You know, my girl friend-

                    OFFICER 
               (Interrupting) 
          Just give me the license, please.

                    ALVY 
          Since you put it that way. 
               (He laughs) 
          It's hard for me to refuse. 
               (He leans over, picks up the 
               license, then proceeds to rip 
               it up.  He lets the pieces go; 
               they float to the ground)
          ... have a, I have a terrific problem 
          with authority, you know.  I'm... it's 
          not your fault.  Don't take it personal.

                                        CUT TO:

INT. JAIL-CELLS CORRIDOR.

A guard moves down the ball to the cell where, Alvy stands with other inmates.
He unlocks the door and opens it, letting Alvy out.

                    ALVY 
          So long, fellas.  Keep in touch. 

He walks down the corridor off screen.

EXT. A STREET IN FRONT OF THE COURT HOUSE - DAY

Policemen are walking up and down the courthouse steps as Alvy and Rob move 
out the door of the building, down the steps to the street.

                    ROB 
          Imagine my surprise when I got your 
          call, Max.

                    ALVY 
               (Carrying his jacket over his 
               shoulder) 
          Yeah.  I had the feeling that I got 
          you at a bad moment.  You know, I heard 
          high-pitched squealing.

They walk over to Rob's convertible and get in.

                    ROB 
               (Starting the car) 
          Twins, Max.  Sixteen-year-olds.  Can you 
          imagine the mathematical possibilities?

                    ALVY 
               (Reacting) 
          You're an actor, Max.  You should be 
          doing Shakespeare in the Park.

                    ROB 
          Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max.  
          I got mugged.  I was playing Richard the 
          Second and two guys with leather jackets 
          stole my leotard.

He puts on an elaborate helmet and goggles.

                    ALVY 
               (Looking at Rob's helmet) 
          Max, are we driving through plutonium?

                    ROB 
          Keeps out the alpha rays, Max.  You 
          don't get old.

                                        CUT TO:

INT. REHEARSAL HALL OF A THEATER.

An actor and actress sit on hard wooden chairs in a sparse rehearsal ball.  
They face each other.  The actress resembles Annie; the actor, Alvy.

                    ACTOR 
          You're a thinking person.  How can you 
          choose this lifestyle?

                    ACTRESS 
          What is so incredibly great about New 
          York?  It's a dying city!  You-you read 
          "Death in Venice".

                    ACTOR 
          You didn't read "Death in Venice" till 
          I gave it to you!

                    ACTRESS 
          Well, you only give me books with the 
          word "death" in the title.

The camera pulls back, showing Alvy sitting with two men at a table set up 
near the actors.  A mirror, running the whole width of the wall, reflects the 
two actors, a script lying on the table between them.  It is obvious now that 
they are rehearsing a scene that Alvy wrote.

                    ACTOR 
               (In mirrored reflection) 
          It's an important issue.

                    ACTRESS 
               (In mirrored reflection) 
          Alvy, you are totally incapable of 
          enjoying life.

The camera moves back to actual actor and actress.

                    ACTRESS 
          You're like New York.  You're an island.

                    ACTOR 
               (Rising with emotion) 
          Okay, if that's all that we've been 
          through together means to you, I guess 
          it's better if we just said goodbye, 
          once and for all!  You know, it's funny, 
          after all the serious talks and passionate 
          moments that it ends here ... in a health
          -food restaurant on Sunset Boulevard.  
          Goodbye, Sunny.

The actor begins to leave as the actress jumps up from her chair.

                    ACTRESS 
          Wait!  I'm-I'm gonna ... go with you. 
               (The actor comes back. They embrace) 
          I love you.

The camera cuts to Alvy, who turns and looks straight into the camera.

                    ALVY 
               (To the audience, gesturing) 
          Tsch, whatta you want?  It was my first 
          play.  You know, you know how you're 
          always tryin' t' get things to come out 
          perfect in art because, uh, it's real 
          difficult in life.  Interestingly, however, 
          I did run into Annie again.  It was on the 
          Upper West Side of Manhattan.

Annie, singing "Seems Like Old Times, " overlaps Alvy's speech and continues 
over the next scene, where Alvy, standing in front of a Manhattan theater, 
shakes hands with Annie and her escort.  The theater marquee reads "OPHULS 
PRIZE FILM: 'THE SORROW AND THE PITY'."

                    ALVY'S VOICE
               (Over the theater scene and, 
               Annie's singing) 
          She had moved back to New York.  She was 
          living in SoHo with some guy. 
               (Laughing) 
          And when I met her she was, of all things, 
          dragging him in to see "The Sorrow and the 
          Pity."  Which I counted as a personal 
          triumph.  Annie and I ... 
               (Alvy's voice continues over the 
               scene shot through a window of 
               Manhattan cafe showing Alvy and 
               Annie sitting at a table, laughing 
               and enjoying themselves) 
          ... we had lunch sometime after that, and, 
          uh, just, uh, kicked around old times.

A series of flashbacks following in quick succession while Annie continues to 
sing:

Annie and Alvy going up the FDR Drive, the day they met playing tennis, Annie 
driving, Alvy bolding up partially eaten sandwich.

Annie and Alvy in the Hamptons house kitchen, Annie banding a live lobster to 
Alvy, who drops it in the pot on the stove.

Annie and Alvy walking side by side by the shoreline.

Alvy at the tennis club, packing his bag, as he looks over his shoulder and 
sees Annie, hands on her face, then clapping, as she offers him a ride home 
in her car.

Annie opening the door to Alvy the night he came over to kill the spider; Annie
and, Alvy in the bookstore buying the "Death" titles; Annie and, Alvy in 
their Hamptons house, Annie reading a school catalogue, the night Alvy puts 
in the red light.

The memories continue to flash on the screen: Annie and Alvy at a friend's 
house, Alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa; Annie and Alvy playing 
tennis; Annie and Alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college 
performance in Annie's hometown; Alvy bolding Annie close, the night he came 
over to kill the spider.

And continue: Annie carrying her luggage and clothes into Alvy's bedroom, Alvy 
following, the day she first moved into his apartment.  Annie holding up her 
sexy birthday present from Alvy, then leaning over and kissing him; Annie and 
Alvy walking down a city street, holding each other close; sitting on the park
bench, observing the people; and kissing, on the FDR Drive, the New York City 
skyline behind them.
The music stops.

Returning to the present, the camera, focusing through the cafe window, shows 
Annie and Alvy across street.  They look about at the city traffic.  Lunch is 
over; it's time.

Alvy and Annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like.  Annie crosses 
the street, Alvy watching her go.  Then he turns, and slowly walks down the 
street off screen.  His voice is heard over the scene:

                    ALVY'S VOICE-OVER 
          After that it got pretty late.  And we 
          both hadda go, but it was great seeing 
          Annie again, right?  I realized what a 
          terrific person she was and-and how much 
          fun it was just knowing her and I-I 
          thought of that old joke, you know, this-
          this-this guy goes to a psychiatrist and 
          says, "Doc, uh, my brother's crazy.  He 
          thinks he's a chicken." And, uh, the 
          doctor says, "Well, why don't you turn 
          him in?" And the guy says, "I would, but 
          I need the eggs." Well, I guess that's 
          pretty much how how I feet about 
          relationships.  You know, they're totally 
          irrational and crazy and absurd and ... 
          but, uh, I guess we keep goin' through it 
          because, uh, most of us need the eggs.

                    THE END

                                   DISSOLVES INTO:

BLACK BACKGROUND; 

credits popping on and off in white.
