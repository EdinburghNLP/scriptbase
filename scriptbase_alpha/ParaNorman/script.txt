          1 INT. RESEARCH LABORATORY - NIGHT 1

           An attractive FEMALE SCIENTIST in a gore-spattered lab
           coat moves fearfully along a wall, passing benches strewn
           with broken lab equipment. Her ample bosom heaves as she
           PANTS nervously, mascara-rimmed eyes darting to and fro.
           Glass SMASHES on the floor nearby and MELODRAMATIC MUSIC
           swells. The woman backs into a shadow, not noticing a
           pair of dead eyes catching the moonlight behind her.
           The music climbs to a frenzy as something GROANS horribly
           into the woman's ear. She spins around on her stiletto
           heels as a rotted face looms out of the darkness,
           drooling through broken teeth, and lunges at her neck.

                          ZOMBIE
           Brains!
           CLOSE ON the woman as she raises her hands and SCREAMS.

           INT. BABCOCK'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Eleven year-old NORMAN BABCOCK sits on the floor
           watching TV. He has large piercing eyes and a messy shock
           of hair. The movie scene we just witnessed continues off-
           screen with the sound of bloodcurdling SCREAMS.
           Behind him sitting upon a sofa is GRANDMA BABCOCK, a
           plump old lady squinting through thick glasses.

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           What's happening now?

                          NORMAN
           The zombie is eating her head,
           Grandma.

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           That's not very nice. What's he
           doing that for?

                          NORMAN
           Because he's a zombie. That's what
           they do.

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           Well he's going to ruin his
           dinner. I'm sure if they just
           bothered to sit down and talk it
           through it'd be a different story.
           Norman CHUCKLES, as if the idea is absurd, then winces as
           he hears his father shout from the kitchen.

           Norman! Didn't I tell you to take
           out the garbage?

                          NORMAN
           Coming, Dad!

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           Tell him to turn up the thermostat
           too, will ya? My feet are like
           ice.
           Norman nods to her and shuffles over to the kitchen door.

           INT. BABCOCK'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Norman's mother, SANDRA BABCOCK, is emptying the
           dishwasher. She is in her late thirties, and wears `mom'
           clothes that do no favors for her figure. His father,
           PERRY BABCOCK, is older, with a neatly-trimmed beard
           trying hard to delineate chin from neck. He stands on a
           chair, decked out in tool belt and safety goggles, even
           though he's only changing a light bulb in a ceiling
           fixture.
           Sandra smiles at her son as he makes his way silently to
           an overstuffed trash can as tall as he is.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Hi. Whatcha watching in there?

                          NORMAN
           Sex and violence.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Oh. That's nice.
           Perry glares over as Norman wrestles with the garbage.

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           Can't you be like other kids your
           age and pitch a tent in the yard,
           or have a healthy interest in
           carpentry?

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Perry...

                          NORMAN
           I thought you said kids my age
           were too busy shoplifting and
           joyriding?

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Norman!
           He hefts the bag onto the floor and ties it in a knot.

           Breezing into the kitchen through the back door while
           CHATTING inanely on her cell phone, Norman's older sister
           COURTNEY is fifteen years-old and is the bleached-blonde
           cheerleader archetype of every schoolboy's sordid dreams.

                          COURTNEY
           Oh yeah, he's r-i-double p-e-d.
           Like, a seven pack at least.

                          (TO NORMAN)
           Ew! Watch it!
           She pushes her brother out of the way as he drags the
           garbage outside.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Courtney, be nice.

                          COURTNEY
           Yeah, she totally doesn't deserve
           him. I mean, she's nice and I
           really like her, but she's a
           complete loser. Yeah, I know.
           Courtney slumps into a chair at the table, twisting a
           strand of gum out of her mouth with a finger.
           Norman returns inside and shuts the door, pausing a
           moment as if thinking something over.

                          NORMAN
           Dad? Grandma says, "Can you turn
           up the heating?" Her feet are
           cold.
           The bubble Courtney is blowing POPS against her face,
           Perry rolls his eyes and GROANS, and Sandra pales.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Now, Perry...

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           How many times do we have to go
           through this, Son? Your
           grandmother is dead!

                          NORMAN
           I know!

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           Then why do you keep on talking to
           her?

                          NORMAN
           Because she talks back!

                          COURTNEY
           O-M-G, you are such a liar!

           I'm not making this up! I swear!
           She talks to me all the time!

                          COURTNEY
           Oh yeah? Prove it!
           Norman levels her a look that says "you asked for this".

                          NORMAN
           She said it's not very ladylike to
           hide photos of the High School
           quarterback with his shirt off in
           your underwear drawer.
           Sandra and Perry raise their eyebrows.

                          COURTNEY
           I knew it! You've been sneaking
           around in my personal stuff!

                          NORMAN
           No I haven't! Grandma told me!

                          COURTNEY
           You are the worst!
           Courtney, brimming with outrage, storms out of the
           kitchen, her ponytail wagging furiously behind her.
           Sandra kneels down beside Norman with a wearily
           sympathetic smile.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Norman, I know you and Grandma
           were very close, but we all have
           to move on. Grandma's in a better
           place now.

                          NORMAN
           No she's not, she's in the living
           room.
           Perry throws his arms in the air, swaying on the chair.

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           Your grandmother was old and sick,
           and she died. That's all there is
           to it!

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Perry, this is just part of the
           mourning process.

           Norman SIGHS and steps between his parents as they argue.
           He mutely heads out of the room.

           This behavior might be okay with
           your side of the family, but I'm

           Norman sits on his bed, using a couple of zombie action
           figures to act out his parents' ongoing "discussion"
           which carries upstairs.
           Norman gets up off the bed and approaches the door.

           He's just sensitive, Perry.

           PERRY BABCOCK (O.S.)
           Oh please, "sensitive" is writing
           poetry and being lousy at team
           sports... not this! I won't have
           him turn out like that uncle of
           yours! If that crazy old tramp has
           been around here putting ideas in
           Norman's head...

           SANDRA BABCOCK (O.S.)
           Perry, no one's had anything to do
           with Uncle Prenderghast in years!
           I bet he doesn't even know what
           Norman looks like!
           Norman quietly closes the door, and the room goes black.

           CLOSE ON a faded photograph of Norman, held in the grimy
           hand of MR PRENDERGHAST. He stands over a dusty desk
           scattered with pictures of Norman, Sandra and older
           family members. He is in a dark study; a wall-to-wall
           trove of curious miscellanea and dumpster-dived junk.

                          MR PRENDERGHAST
           Not much time, not much time...
           He pulls an old leather-bound book out from the mess, and
           traces a finger over a woodcut illustration on its cover;
           an ethereal woman lying beneath a cluster of stars.
           Wincing with pain, the man drops the book and clutches at
           his chest, COUGHING and GASPING horribly.
           CAMERA PANS to a wall covered in countless photographs,
           newspaper clippings and scrawled occult markings. It is a
           shrine of sorts; a madman's recondite genealogy project,
           and at its center is a photograph of Norman, posing with
           his family on vacation.
           ZOOM IN to the photograph, hurtling past the Babcocks and
           through dense trees further and further into a dark
           forest.

           Dressed for school, Norman pauses at the front door and

           happily, and Grandma smiles back.
           Courtney passes him as she comes down the stairs in the
           opposite direction. She also stops to look at the sofa,
           but to her eyes it is empty. She sneers contemptuously.

           Norman ambles past houses and lawns spotted with small-
           town America detritus; cheap plastic lawn furniture,
           peeling-paint fences and cookie-cutter topiary. Here the
           quaint colonial buildings are mostly in disrepair, their
           picket fences rotten or daubed in graffiti.

           Norman is watched dubiously by the occasional passer-by
           as he shouts amiable greetings to people who simply
           aren't there.

           Good morning! Hey Bruce! How's it
           goin'? Not much. I'm kind of late
           for school. I need to go. Hi, nice
           to see you guys. Good morning.
           Sorry I gotta run. Excuse me.
           Pardon me. See ya.
           At one street corner, Norman bends over a gutter. He is
           watched curiously by a man retrieving his morning paper
           across the other side of the street.
           MAN'S POV - Norman crouches over the flattened remains of
           raccoon road kill.

           Hey there little buddy! C'mere!
           He realizes he is being stared at and slowly turns to
           face the onlooker, then hurries away.
           Though no one else sees them, to Norman's eyes, a whole
           host of ghosts are meandering through the streets.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Yeah, good to see you! How you
           doin'? Hi Mrs Hardman. You look

           ghost of a parachutist impaled in the branches of a
           roadside tree.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING

           Its industrial days now rusted behind it, Blithe Hollow
           has become a run-down tourist town, celebrating its
           heritage with lame fetes and crass knick-knacks. A
           massive billboard beside the main square reads "BLITHE
           HOLLOW - A GREAT PLACE TO HANG!" illustrated by a group
           of waving Puritans beside an equally cheerful witch
           hanging from a gallows. Across the street a huge banner
           suggests this year is particularly important for the
           town; "BLITHE HOLLOW - 300 BEWITCHIN' YEARS!"
           The town center is lacking in charm; its historical
           buildings subsumed into a vulgar modern thoroughfare with
           gaudy witch-themed shop fronts and cracked sidewalks.
           Everywhere Norman walks, the witch theme is prevalent.
           Cars have bumper stickers that extol such witticisms as
           "MY OTHER CAR IS A BROOM". There's a dingy bar, the BAR
           GENTO, and a greeting card store called BEST WITCHES.
           Norman hurries past SHERIFF HOOPER, a heavyset black
           woman, and DEPUTY DWAYNE, lanky and awkward and looking
           like he'd rather be elsewhere.

                          SHERIFF HOOPER
           Watch and learn. "Parking
           violation" is my middle name.

                          DEPUTY DWAYNE
           Really? I thought it was Rhona.
           They glance up disdainfully as Norman passes by. Clearly
           in this town Norman has something of a bad reputation.

                         

          12 EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MORNING 12

           Norman walks up a tree lined path that leads to a squat
           school building. Out front, the name "BLITHE HOLLOW
           MIDDLE SCHOOL" is carved into an ugly hunk of granite.
           ParaNorman 9.

                         12 CONTINUED: 12
           SCHOOL KIDS line the path in front of Norman; a gauntlet
           of jeering, merciless, pre-pubescent horror. Norman takes
           a deep breath as he begins his daily walk of ridicule.
           Most of the kids give him a wide berth, but others sneer
           and WHISPER as he passes.
           A bell RINGS the start of the school day, and everyone
           makes a bee-line for the building.
           Someone barges Norman with their shoulder, knocking his
           backpack to the ground. Other kids SNICKER as they step
           over him.
           As the last of them head through the lobby doors, Norman
           is left alone on the path.
           Norman bends down to retrieve his spilled possessions,
           and a dark shape beyond the gate catches his eye.
           NORMAN'S POV - Mr Prenderghast, barely visible as he
           stands within the shadow of a tree, stares back at him.
           Norman frowns and squints his eyes, but now sees only
           trees and shadows, so he continues up the steps.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY, LOCKERS - MORNING

           An expanse of unevenly lacquered floor, scuffed by scores
           of dragged heels. Rows of dented lockers line the walls.
           Norman stands before his locker, across which someone has
           daubed the word "FREAK" in marker. Clearly something of a
           daily ritual, he reaches inside, takes out a bottle of
           surface cleaner and a rag and proceeds to wipe it off.
           Across the hallway, another kid is removing graffiti from
           his locker. NEIL is overweight with frizzy red hair, and
           is busily rubbing a handkerchief over the word "FATTY".
           He watches Norman with interest.
           A voice behind his shoulder gives Norman a start.

                          ALVIN
           Hey, ghost jerk! You know what?
           Norman turns to find textbook bully ALVIN, the only 6th
           grader in his class who shaves, looming over him. He is
           flanked by a couple of leering sycophants, one of whom
           wears a T-shirt emblazoned with "TEAM ALVIN".
           Norman SIGHS.

                          NORMAN
           What do you want, Alvin?

                          ALVIN
           Why don't you see some more
           ghosts, goober?

           The kids LAUGH uproariously, encouraging Alvin to show
           off some more.

                          ALVIN (CONT'D)
           Hey! Hey! Norman!
           Alvin points to a fly that has landed on the locker
           beside him. He swats it flat with his hand.

                          ALVIN (CONT'D)
           Talk to that.
           The kids around Alvin burst into LAUGHTER.

                          ALVIN (CONT'D)
           That is so Alvin!
           The bullies strut away, content in the psychological
           damage they've managed to inflict.

                          PUG
           Loser!

                          ALVIN
           That was good, right guys?
           Norman mutters as they leave, but not loud enough so as
           anyone might hear.

                          NORMAN
           Flies don't talk.
           Across the hall, Neil continues to watch with sympathy,
           but he is already being hurried along by his friend
           SALMA, a nerdy Indian kid with braces.

                          SALMA
           Neil, come on. Let's go.

           INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Amidst stacked bleachers, foam mats and stray dodge
           balls, a crudely constructed stage fills one end of the
           gymnasium. Mediocre art class scenery represents a
           colonial town, complete with plywood hills, chapel and
           crescent moon dangling perilously from a basketball hoop.
           In a director's chair far too small for the job is MRS
           HENSCHER, an imposing woman with spectacles and beret who
           looks like she smells of too-much perfume.
           At the front of the stage wearing a pilgrim hat and
           carrying a large scroll, is NORMAN. He is surrounded by
           kids whose attempts at home made period costume leave a
           lot to be desired.

           You stink of illiteracy!

                          (A BEAT)
           Pilgrims? The Mayflower? Don't any
           of you know anything about the
           history of this town?
           Mrs Henscher tries her best to remain unfazed.

           MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
           Puritans were strict and devout
           settlers, who came here to build a
           home, a place without sin. What is
           it now Salma?
           Salma is holding her hand up. She looks like the Wicked
           Witch of the West. Even beneath green makeup and plastic
           warty nose, it is clear she is not best pleased.

                          SALMA
           Why is the witch always a hideous
           old crone with a pointy hat and a
           broomstick? I don't believe it's
           historically accurate, Mrs
           Henscher!
           Mrs Henscher's knuckles clench white around her script.
           She attempts an understanding smile, in the same way a
           shark might.

                          MRS HENSCHER
           It's not supposed to be. It's
           supposed to sell postcards and key
           chains.

                          (CLAPS HANDS)
           So let's try it again. Top of page
           six, Norman.
           Norman skips ahead on his scroll.

                          NORMAN
           The founding fathers of Blithe
           Hollow discovered an evil witch
           amongst them...

                          MRS HENSCHER
           No no, Norman, with gusto! Like
           this!
           Waving her arms theatrically, she bellows Norman's lines,
           milking every syllable for effect.

           MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
           They put her on trial and hanged
           her!

           MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
           But the vengeful witch cursed her
           accusers, seven of them in all, to
           die a horrible and gruesome death,
           and rise from their graves as the
           living dead; their souls doomed to
           an eternity of damnation!

                          (A BEAT)
           Now I want you to try that again,
           but with conviction! My reputation
           is at stake here, and I won't have
           this turn out like that wretched
           Kabuki debacle of oh-nine!
           As she launches into her lecture, Norman notices a change
           in the room. The lights dim, the wind outside picks up,
           and indistinct shapes flicker at the corners of his eyes.
           Norman glances around at the other kids on the stage, to
           see if they are seeing what he is seeing. For a split
           second the children are replaced with faded figures in
           real Puritan dress. Seven solemn figures.
           As he turns around nervously, Norman sees the suggestion
           of another place fizzing in and out of the shadows...

           MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
           Norman! Are you listening to me,
           boy?
           Norman is brought back to the real world with a start,
           and nods timidly from behind his scroll.

                          NORMAN
           Sorry, Mrs Henscher.

                          MRS HENSCHER
           So am I. Now, unless there's any
           other issues, let us resume...
           They put her on trial and hanged
           her!
           Neil turns excitedly to Norman.

                          NEIL
           Ooh! This is my moment!
           He shuffles toward Salma and swings his branch around,
           not realizing Alvin has slung the hangman's noose around
           Norman's neck.
           Norman is yanked off balance and staggers into Neil who
           keels over, rigid branch arms unable to stop his fall. He
           lands on top of Salma, her kicking legs sticking out from
           under him as though Dorothy's house had just landed on
           stage.
           The kids break into uncontrollable LAUGHTER.

           beet red.

           As kids hotfoot it out of the building as quickly as
           possible, Norman stands pitiably in front of his locker.
           Fresh graffiti reads "SEE YOU TOMORROW, FREAK".
           Norman heads for the door, and pretends not to hear when
           Neil shouts out behind him.

           intently at the side of his head.

                          NORMAN
           I keep telling you, Neil. I like
           to be alone.

           So do I. Let's do it together!
           You shouldn't let them get you

           that to me.

                          NORMAN
           Why?

                          NEIL
           Because I'm fat. And my allergies
           make my eyes leak. And I sweat
           when I walk too fast. And I have a
           lunchbox with a kitten on it. And
           I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I
           guess there's a whole bunch of

           bigger and more stupid, you'd

           Norman and Neil walk away from the school along a tree
           lined street at the end of which stands a huge
           commemorative statue. It is a grotesque effigy of the
           evil witch from the local legend.

           MR PRENDERGHAST (O.S.)
           Psssst!
           The boys stop. It seems to be coming from the witch.

           Wild-eyed Mr Prenderghast suddenly leaps in front of
           them, startling them as he staggers closer.

           Yes. I know. I was told not to
           talk to you. Sorry.
           Mr Prenderghast steps in front of Neil, leaning closer to
           Norman and whispering conspiratorially.

                          MR PRENDERGHAST
           And you know why you're not
           supposed to talk to me?
           Norman tries to back away.

           MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)
           I can see ghosts too! And I know
           that's not all you've been seeing
           lately, is it? Bad omens? Things

           There's something you really need
           to know! This is the most
           important thing you will ever

           An apple bounces off Mr Prenderghast's head. He turns to
           find Neil standing behind them on the path, lunchbox open
           in his hand providing leftover low-carb ammunition.

           ironic. We buried him in the yard.
           Could you see him?
           Norman frowns disbelievingly, completely taken aback.

                          NORMAN
           Maybe.

                          NEIL

           EXT. NEIL'S DRIVEWAY

           Neil forcibly drags Norman up the front driveway of a
           pastel-painted house. A pair of legs spotted in oil stick
           out from beneath a pimped-up camper van.
           Neil's brother MITCH calls out from under the van.

                          MITCH
           Neil? That you?

                          NEIL
           Hey Mitch! We're gonna go play
           with the dead dog in the garden
           and we're not even gonna have to
           dig him up first!
           Mitch sits up. He's a strapping six-foot jock with
           tattooed biceps. The kind of guy who wears year-round
           flip-flops.

                          MITCH
           What'd you say?
           Mitch pulls his brother aside so as to exclude Norman,
           who stands awkwardly a little way away, surrounded by
           cheery lawn ornaments and ineptly manicured topiary.

                          MITCH (CONT'D)
           Neil, isn't he that weird kid?
           Y'know, "Look at me, I talk to
           ghosts so people will pay
           attention to me."
           Mitch makes a goofy face and twitches farcically.

                          NEIL
           Can you stop doing that? It's
           kinda stupid.

                          MITCH
           Now listen to me, you don't need
           to be hanging out with weird
           people. That's a tip.
           Neil scowls at his brother.

                          NEIL
           Don't blow this for me, Mitch.
           This one's not weird. He talks to
           dead people.
           Neil has had enough and defiantly walks away from his
           brother.

           EXT. NEIL'S GARDEN - LATER

           Neil rummages around in the bushes of his back yard,
           surrounded by a gloriously tasteless menagerie of lawn
           ornaments. Norman stands slightly to one side surveying
           the rows of plastic gnomes and wondering if he should
           have gone straight home after all.

                          NEIL
           He's around here somewhere...

                          (A BEAT)
           So does everyone come back as a
           ghost?

           Norman hesitates. This level of interest is new to him.

                          NORMAN
           No. My grandma told me it's
           usually people who still have
           stuff to figure out. Or sometimes
           it's the ones who died suddenly,
           or in a bad way.
           A BARK, and Norman turns to see a translucent puppy
           wagging its tail cheerfully, despite being chopped neatly
           into two halves.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Bub?

                          NEIL
           Is he there? How's he look?
           Bub BARKS, then his front half notices his tail and runs
           behind to sniff his own backside.

                          NORMAN
           Uh... good.
           Bub bounds over to Neil, runs clean through his chubby
           calves, then doubles back for another try.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           He's happy to see you.

                          NEIL

                          ("DOGGY" VOICE)
           Who's a good boy, huh? Good boy!

                          (TO NORMAN)
           Can he feel it if I pet him?

                          NORMAN
           Yeah, I guess.
           Neil bends over and kisses the air by his ankles, making
           a "coochy-coo" face.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Uh... that's not his chin.
           Neil stops mid-smooch, and quickly stands up.
           Norman watches as Neil picks up a stick and waves it in
           front of Bub's nose, even though he can't see him.

                          NEIL
           Go get it!

                          NORMAN

           Yeah well, it's still fun. Good
           boy! Bring it back! Go get it,
           Bub! Good boy!
           CLOSE ON Norman as he watches Neil toss the stick back
           and forth across the garden. The stick lands near his
           feet and he bends down to pick it up.

                          NEIL (CONT'D)
           Why don't you try?

                          NORMAN
           `Cos I don't really, uh... You can
           go.

           No, no, it's fun! Try it!

                          NORMAN
           No I don't want to.

           You throw it. It's really easy.

                          NORMAN
           No it's okay. You can throw it.

                          NEIL
           No, c'mon, it's really fun.

                          NORMAN
           Here. You go first.

                          NEIL
           No, you try it. I already went
           like fifty times.

                          NORMAN
           Okay, what do I do?

                          NEIL
           You get the stick, you pull it
           back, and you throw it!

                         
           Norman throws it and accidentally hits Neil in the head,
           knocking him over.

                          NORMAN
           Neil? Sorry!
           As Norman runs over to him, Neil lies on his back
           GIGGLING, the stick held between his teeth.

           PANTING and WHEEZING, Mr Prenderghast staggers into his

                          MR PRENDERGHAST
           I'll show him, and that scary
           little fat kid...
           He shakily rummages around the collected papers and
           trinkets, and pulls out the leather bound book, all the
           time GRUMBLING crazily.

           MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)
           Doesn't he realize we're running
           out of t...
           With a strangled CROAK he clutches dizzily at his chest,
           then keels over backwards, stiffly hitting the floor with
           a THUMP.
           Silence, then, a stream of spectral orbs sputter out of
           him, sculpting his shape in the air.
           With a GASP, Mr Prenderghast's corpse sucks the spirit
           back in, and he staggers back to his feet.

           MR PRENDERGHAST (CONT'D)
           No! Not yet! Not yet!
           He CROAKS again, this time for real, CRASHING back down
           onto the ground.
           The ghostly shape re-emerges from the body.
           He blinks his eyes, looking around as if he's just been
           woken from a deep sleep, then down at the defunct body
           lying at his feet.

           A notice beneath it reads "SPELLING BEE - NEXT WENSDAY".
           A chorus of kids' voices can be heard SINGING from
           inside, belting out an operatic rendition of Donovan's
           "Season of the Witch".

           Rows of plastic chairs in front of the spotlit stage are
           occupied by expectant families. Among the sea of faintly
           buzzing video cameras, and a ripple of APPLAUSE, Sandra
           politely smiles at the acting talents of other peoples'
           children. Next to her, Perry struggles to fit a battery
           into his camera.

           ANGLE ON STAGE as Salma, in full witch get-up, waves her
           hands theatrically at the other children.

                          SALMA
           I curse you accusers to die a
           horrible and gruesome death and
           rise from your graves as the
           living dead; your souls doomed to
           an eternity of damnation!
           The Pilgrims who aren't dying and rising from the dead
           begin to menace Salma with their farming implements, and
           begin a slow ominous chant.

                          KIDS
           Kill the witch! Kill the witch!
           Sandra nudges her husband and cheerily points toward the

           Norman hears a HOOTING sound from above. An owl with big
           glowing eyes wheels down over the audience from the beams
           of the gymnasium.
           Norman glances around, wondering why no one else seems to
           notice as it glides low and alights in the papier mache
           branches on Neil's head. It turns to Norman and HOOTS.

           The chanting seems to deepen and slur and the air grows
           dark and thick. The shapes of the audience and the kids
           beside him swim around, blurring like a finger pulled
           through oil paint. The ceiling disintegrates into clouds,
           which CRACKLE with lightning.

                          NORMAN
           (under his breath)

           All around trees have sprouted out of nowhere, and
           through the darkness in the distance are occasional
           lights of small houses. This might be how this very spot
           looked three centuries ago.

           As Norman turns on the spot GASPING, he hears a RUSTLE in
           the bushes behind him and spots several dark and ominous
           figures in Pilgrim clothing scouring the undergrowth.

                          PURITAN
           Witch! We know you're out there!
           Norman stands on a twig which, naturally, CRACKS loudly,
           and the figure turns around and points at him.

           More figures emerge from out of the darkness, wielding
           hayforks. They SHOUT threateningly and, as one man, surge
           toward him. Norman turns and runs.
           The trees around him are shifting, but there's no wind
           blowing the branches. Limbs GROAN as they twist, bearing
           down on him like ragged talons trying to stop his escape.
           Soon he can run no further, the way ahead tangled up into
           a wall of thorny fingers.

           Norman finds himself pushed up against the trunk of a
           huge tree, and a knothole grimaces at him, wood splitting
           open into a hag-like mouth. It furrows a mossy brow and
           speaks in a low rumbling voice.

                          TREE
           The dead are coming!
           Norman GASPS and tries to push himself away, but the
           pursuing figures are drawing closer, and there's no
           escape.
           A familiar voice whispers out of nowhere.

           NEIL (O.S.)
           Hey buddy! Are you okay?
           Norman turns around to find the knothole is now Neil's
           face, bulging out of the side of the tree with a look of
           concern. This is the last straw, and Norman SCREAMS.

           He continues running directly off the edge of the stage
           and lands on the floor with a THUMP.
           For a moment no one knows quite how to react. Mrs
           Henscher quizzically checks her script.
           Norman's eyes focus and he sees everyone standing around

           Worst of all, peering around parents' legs with a look of

           everyone could see what I see! I
           didn't ask to be born this way!
           Perry mutters as he slams his door shut.

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           Funny, neither did we.
           Norman catches the remark and feels it hard in his gut.
           His mother hears it too, and leans over her seat with a
           look of sympathy.
           A beat as she sees the pain in her son's face.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Y'know, sometimes people say
           things that seem mean, but they do
           it because they're afraid.

                          NORMAN
           He's my dad. He shouldn't be
           afraid of me.

           He's not afraid of you. He's
           afraid for you.
           Sadly, Norman climbs out of the car.

           EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

           Ominous clouds roll long shadows over the school
           building.
           Norman stands at the bottom of the school steps, trying
           to prepare himself for what he knows is going to be a bad
           day. He steels himself, and SIGHS.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING

           Norman walks the familiar gauntlet of school kids, only
           this time the abuse is tenfold.

                          KID #1
           Look! It's AbNorman!

                          KID #2
           What'd the tree tell you today,
           Norman?

                          KID #3

           An overhead bulb casts a dim light over chipped wall
           tiles and yellowed ceramic sinks with leaky faucets.
           The door opens and Norman hurries inside, a number of
           voices still SHOUTING behind him. He shuts the door,
           cutting them off, and leans against it, taking a breath.
           He heads over to the first stall. The door is locked, so
           he takes the next one.
           CLOSE ON Alvin, sitting on the toilet in the next stall
           scribbling obscenities on the wall to pass the time. He
           pauses as he hears the lid drop next door, then resumes
           his vandalism.
           Norman sits on the lid of the toilet, pulling his knees
           up under his chin feeling sorry for himself.
           ParaNorman 26.

                         36 CONTINUED: 36
           ANGLE ON toilet paper in an industrial-sized roll. It
           jitters on its mount and begins to turn slowly on its
           own, unspooling sheet by sheet toward the floor. Norman
           frowns and watches as it stops unravelling and a draught
           of wind blows out of nowhere, ruffling his hair.
           The toilet roll suddenly spins violently, flinging the
           paper into the air in reams. The screws holding the
           dispenser to the wall RATTLE fiercely.
           The toilet underneath Norman begins to shake and shudder,
           spilling water over the floor. Norman WAILS loudly as he
           jumps onto the back of the cistern.
           Alvin is frozen in place in his stall, hearing the noises
           and really not sure how to react to them. He glances down
           and sees toilet water leaking across the tiles.
           He quickly pulls up his pants to cover his dignity, and
           jumps up off the toilet with a SQUEAL.
           In Norman's stall everything stops dead and the lid of
           the toilet slowly CREAKS open.
           Norman GASPS as Mr Prenderghast's face stares up at him
           out of the toilet bowl. With some effort the old man's
           ghost shimmies out of the toilet, eventually POPPING out
           like a cork from a bottle, hovering in the air in front
           of Norman's face.

                          NORMAN
           You died?!

                          PRENDERGHAST GHOST
           Yeah, but I got unfinished
           business here!

                          NORMAN
           Ew! Couldn't you use another
           stall?

                          PRENDERGHAST GHOST
           My ghost isn't going anywhere
           until I pass on my duty to
           another! And that would be you!

                          NORMAN
           Me? No, you must have it wrong!

                          PRENDERGHAST GHOST
           Oh it's you all right! I've been
           holding back the witch's curse for
           years, but now I'm dead. It has to
           be you!

                          NORMAN
           But I... I don't know what any of
           it means!

                         36 CONTINUED: (2) 36
           Before Norman's eyes the bathroom stall and everything
           beyond it is ripped away, revealing thick undergrowth and
           tall trees. Norman is suddenly sat on the toilet in the
           middle of a forest.

                          PRENDERGHAST GHOST
           It means the past is coming back
           to haunt you! Time is running out!
           The anniversary of the witch's
           death is tonight. Her ghost is
           going to wake up, and when she
           does she'll raise the dead! You
           gotta keep her in her grave!
           The toilet paper on the ground twists up beneath Norman's
           feet, sculpting skull faces and clutching hands that
           reach for him as he shrinks back.

                          NORMAN
           But I'm just a kid! How am I
           supposed to stop it?
           In an instant the air and trees around him are eaten
           away, the school bathroom reappearing through the holes.

                          PRENDERGHAST GHOST
           Read from the book at the spot the
           witch was buried!

                          NORMAN
           What book?

                          PRENDERGHAST GHOST
           The one in my hands!
           Norman looks at the ghost's wispy hands.

           PRENDERGHAST GHOST (CONT'D)
           Not these hands, my other hands!
           The me that's at home in my study
           starting to smell a little funny!
           Norman looks sick and overwhelmed, but the ghost doesn't
           let up, swirling right up to his face.

           PRENDERGHAST GHOST (CONT'D)
           Get the book and read from it!
           Before the sun sets tonight!

                          NORMAN
           But this is crazy!

                          PRENDERGHAST GHOST
           Do I look crazy to you?
           Norman pauses a beat. Mr Prenderghast is floating upside
           down, various bits of bathroom detritus orbiting around
           him. A piece of toilet paper dangles off his nose.

                          PRENDERGHAST GHOST
           Swear!

                          NORMAN
           Y-you mean like the "f" word?

                          PRENDERGHAST GHOST
           I mean promise!

           Okay, okay, I promise...

                          PRENDERGHAST GHOST
           That'll do!
           Mr Prenderghast's ghost begins to disappear, bubbling and
           melting at the edges like a burning photograph.

                          NORMAN
           No! Mr Prenderghast, wait!
           Alvin, hearing only Norman's voice, gingerly peeks around
           the corner of his stall.

                          PRENDERGHAST GHOST
           Sorry kid, I'm done here! I'm
           free! I'm finally free!

                          NORMAN
           Wait! No, you can't leave now!
           Please! I don't understand.
           Mr Prenderghast hangs in the air a moment, face scrunched
           up as he awaits his release, CACKLING crazily.
           The ghost explodes into a million particles of light,
           blowing open the stall door and catapulting Alvin
           backwards across the room. The mirrors behind him crack
           and the light bulb shatters.
           From the floor, Alvin groggily looks up and sees Norman
           framed in the stall with the door hanging off its hinges.
           He reaches over and flushes the toilet.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Uh... yeah. You might want to give
           that a few minutes.
           He grabs his bag and runs out of the room.

           Norman sprints madly for the main doors, passing Neil and
           Salma who glance up from their lockers as he stumbles by.

                          NEIL
           Norman?
           Alvin tears around the corner in pursuit, but Neil stands
           in his way, waving his arms indignantly.

                          NEIL (CONT'D)
           Hey! What's the big deal?

                          ALVIN
           Don't get your bra in a twist, fat
           boy, this has nothing to do with
           you! Keep out of my way!

           Or what?

           I don't have boobs. These are
           pectorals!
           Alvin jabs him in the chest.

           Ow! My boobs!
           Neil swiftly steps aside.
           Alvin reaches the door to see Norman disappearing along
           the path as fast as he can. Alvin YELLS after him.

           INT. BABCOCK'S HOUSE, NORMAN'S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

           Norman paces his room looking pale and anxious as he
           hears the front door shut downstairs. Everywhere he turns
           he finds himself face to face with some zombie related
           novelty, from his lurid horror posters to his shelves of
           ghoulish action figures, and it's not doing anything for
           his nerves.
           His cell phone BEEPS from his pocket, giving him a start.
           He takes it out and reads a text; "COME TO THE WINDOW".
           Norman cautiously walks over and peers around the edge of
           the window frame.
           A figure stands motionless in the yard below, sheets of
           laundry billowing off the clothes line beside it. It
           stares up at Norman through the blank eye holes of a
           hockey mask.
           Norman GASPS and jumps back.
           With a frown, he re-emerges and opens the window.
           The figure lifts the mask, and Neil beams out from
           underneath, waving excitedly.

                          NEIL
           You wanna play some hockey?
           Norman SIGHS.

           I've kinda got other things on my
           mind right now.
           Neil looks a little uncomfortable.

           Is it all that walking dead stuff
           again?

           to go up to the old graveyard to
           stop it! Before the sun sets

           Neil shifts uneasily as he processes.

                          NEIL
           So you wanna come play a bit
           later?

                          NEIL
           Yeah, but I thought my idea was
           less likely to get us eaten.
           Norman knows he's on his own in this.

                          NORMAN
           Just go home, Neil. I'm better off
           on my own anyway.

           Norman reaches up and closes the window. Neil's shoulders
           sag and he turns away.
           Across the room, his Grandma materializes, and squints
           her eyes through the window as Neil awkwardly pulls
           himself over the garden fence.

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK

           No one.
           Norman isn't in the mood for any more discussion.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Dad says I'm not supposed to talk
           to you any more, Grandma.

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           Jackass. If I were a poltergeist
           I'd throw something at his head.
           Y'know, by rights I'm supposed to
           be frolicking in paradise with
           your grandfather, but I'm not.

           Norman looks up as she drifts closer to the bed.

                          NORMAN
           So why did you stay?

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           I was never one for frolicking.
           I'll bet there's no cable or
           canasta up there either. Besides,
           I promised I'd always look out for
           you.
           She smiles, floating in a sitting position at the end of
           Norman's bed. She bobs gently, like a balloon. For a
           second, this seems to comfort Norman, but then another
           thought crosses his mind.

                          NORMAN
           So it's your... duty?

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           In a manner of speaking...

                          NORMAN
           And you'd do it no matter what?

                          GRANDMA BABCOCK
           Of course.

           Even if it was something really

           There's nothing wrong with being
           scared Norman, so long as you
           don't let it change who you are.
           Norman thinks this over, then smiles up at her again. She
           goes to rub his head affectionately, but her ghost hand
           just passes right through his spiky hair.
           She gives him a wink, and drifts away through the wall.
           He is still scared, but now determined too. He steels
           himself and grabs his jacket from his bed.

           The tiny room is crammed full of posters, pom-poms, plush
           toys and plastic trophies. Pretty much everything is
           pink. Courtney sits talking on her phone, cotton buds
           between her toes as her painted nails dry.

           So I said to her, "Girl, come back 
           and talk to me when your basket
           toss gets twelve thousand hits on
           YouTube!" Yeah, no, I said that.
           (listens and nods)
           Yeah, I'm stuck on lame patrol.
           Tonight's gonna be a total yawn.
           From downstairs, a door SLAMS. Courtney frowns, puts her
           hand over the phone and shouts out.

                          COURTNEY (CONT'D)
           Norman?!

           EXT. BABCOCK'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Beneath a florid evening sky, the Babcock's drive is in
           darkness. Pedalling furiously, Norman rides his bike out
           of the shadows into the light of the street.

           COURTNEY (O.S.)
           You better not be sneaking out you
           little weirdo!

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS

           On a street corner two teenage girls approach Alvin and
           Pug, who have laid out a breakdancing mat and a beatbox
           and are doing their best to impress. Alvin imagines he is
           wowing the girls with his krumping, his ham-like limbs
           flying around and Pug hollering support, but in truth
           they watch in morbid fascination.
           A faint CLATTERING sound down the road grows louder.
           Norman suddenly THUNDERS past them on his bike, spinning
           Alvin on the spot and knocking him onto his butt.
           Show over, Alvin blunders to his feet, his eyes following
           Norman's trajectory up the dark road, and GROWLS.

                         

          46 EXT. WOODED LANE, MR PRENDERGHAST'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING 46

           Tall conifers rise up high on either side of the road,
           now little more than a dirt track. Norman pedals up the
           hill and swerves, skidding to a stop in the gravel.
           He climbs off the bike, eyes fixed on a ramshackle house
           partially hidden in the foliage, its porch door swinging
           and CREAKING eerily in the breeze.
           He cautiously advances past a crooked mailbox on which is
           written "PRENDERGHAST", and steps onto the wooden porch.

           The fading light of day spills across the floorboards and
           faded wallpaper of a long passage.

                          NORMAN
           Hello? Mr Prenderghast?
           Motes of dust float around Norman as he moves slowly
           toward a door, slightly ajar, muttering to himself.
           He quietly makes his way past all manner of objects that
           epitomize the state of Mr Prenderghast's mind; a
           mannequin in a shopping cart, a pile of broken
           typewriters, a suspended bag of spoons, a closet full of
           identically soiled hobo suits, a Nordic track...

           INT. PRENDERGHAST'S HOUSE, STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           The study is filled with teetering piles of junk and old
           furniture draped over in dust sheets. A crucifix hangs
           over a metal cot with rumpled bedding. This is evidently
           where the old man lived his whole life. Starlight from a
           window picks out a macabre halo on a shape on the floor:
           Mr Prenderghast, dead where he fell, tightly clutching a
           leather-bound book.
           CLOSE ON Norman's face as he swallows nervously and steps
           closer to the body. He gingerly takes hold of the book
           and gives a gentle tug. It holds fast in the rigor mortis
           grasp. He tugs harder, shaking the book repeatedly, the
           corpse shaking with it.

                          NORMAN
           Let go!
           Norman spends several strenuous moments dragging the body
           across the floorboards, Mr Prenderghast's head glancing
           off table legs and smacking repeatedly against the
           floorboards, as Norman tries to wrestle the book free.
           With a final yank the book pulls loose and, GASPING,
           Norman grips the book to his chest and runs to the door.

           Norman careens through the door, leaps off the porch and
           sprints along the wooded lane up the hill, watched by
           Alvin, concealed behind some bushes.

                         

                         50 50

           EXT. WOODED HILLTOP, OLD CHAPEL GRAVEYARD - LATER

           Norman emerges from the woods, his long shadow preceding
           him as the sun begins its descent behind the tall trees.
           ParaNorman 35.

                         50 CONTINUED: 50
           He pauses and stares out across weathered tombstones
           poking out amidst tangles of thorns.
           Clutching the book tight, Norman wrenches open the heavy
           gate, its rusted padlock crumbling apart.
           Eventually the track runs up to a stone slab surrounded
           on either side by thick bramble. Norman brushes aside
           vines and reads an epitaph engraved into the stone;

           "HERE LIES BURIED THE SEVEN VICTIMS OF THE BLITHE HOLLOW

           CURSE. MAY YOUR SOULS FIND EVENTUAL AND EVERLASTING

           SALVATION. 1712."
           Norman pushes through the thick bushes into a secluded
           plot of land behind the slab with seven gravestones
           sticking out from the undergrowth.

                          NORMAN
           This is it!
           The sun continues its descent, casting an ever
           lengthening shadow of treetops across the graveyard.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Read from the book, stop the
           curse, go home and pretend this
           never happened.
           Norman steels himself, opens the book and starts to read.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           "Once upon a time, in a far-off
           land there lived a king and queen
           in a magnificent castle..."
           He pauses, confused by what he's reading.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           What? A fairy... tale...?
           A hand reaches over his shoulder from nowhere, whipping
           the book out of his grasp. He spins around to find Alvin
           standing behind him.

                          ALVIN
           What ya got there, Geekula?
           Norman launches himself at the book, but Alvin holds him
           back at arm's length.

                          NORMAN
           Give it back!

                          ALVIN
           Can't wait to see everybody's
           faces when they hear about this
           one!

           No, don't! Alvin!

                          ALVIN
           Hey! Nobody makes me miss out on a
           possible date with a girl that
           almost had some interest in
           talking to me. Yeah? Thought so!
           You got nothin' to say!

                          NORMAN
           Uh-oh.

                          ALVIN
           Dang straight "uh-oh". That's what
           happens when Alvin gets around
           here. Uh-oh is that Alvin? Uh-oh
           Alvin's gonna make me run home to
           mommy.
           As Norman twists and wrestles against the bully the
           turbulent clouds in the sky above them twist and coalesce
           into the vague semblance of a huge grinning face. The
           face of a witch.
           There is an enormous RUMBLE and a flash of lightning
           silhouettes the boys.

                          ALVIN (CONT'D)
           Uh-oh. What is that?
           The wind has picked up, HOWLING through the gravestones.
           Norman looks at the face leering out of the clouds.

                          NORMAN
           It's her!
           Another violent CRACK of thunder and flash of light, and
           the wind instantly cuts out. The boys stand stock still.
           Reaching down like a colossal arm, a great plume of cloud
           spirals over the cemetery, enveloping the tumbledown
           chapel and seeping around the gravestones. Fingers of
           murky fog slither across the ground, occasionally pausing
           and hanging in the air as though sniffing it. There is
           something eerily playful in the movement of the tendrils.
           The boys are jolted as an awful high pitched SCREAM blows
           through the graveyard like a shockwave, pulsing through
           the fog like a heartbeat.
           Norman and Alvin cover their ears and cower as the fog
           suddenly rears up like a claw and fiercely gouges into
           the earth in front of the boys.
           ParaNorman 37.

                         50 CONTINUED: (3) 50
           Silence, then the ground begins to RUMBLE beneath their
           feet and ripples beneath the tombstones. Stone slabs
           GRIND and shift. One CRACKS right through the center.

                          ALVIN
           What's that sound?
           Norman watches, horrified, as the wet earth atop one of
           the graves splits and a skeletal hand bursts through!
           Norman watches as more graves bulge and break open and
           mud-encrusted shapes begin to emerge through the earth.
           The air is filled with anguished MOANING, the glowing fog
           dancing and whirling about the hatching figures.
           The two boys are rooted to the spot, mouths hanging open.
           CLOSE ON one of the figures crawling out of the ground
           into a patch of moonlight. Ragged and rotten it wears the
           mud-encrusted clothes of a colonial Puritan. It stares
           down at its hands, almost in disbelief, then lifts its
           face up to the sky and lets out a HOWL.
           Thunder that sounds like deep and abysmal LAUGHTER echoes
           through the turbulent clouds.
           The boys find themselves backed up against another
           headstone, this one engraved with the name "JUDGE
           HOPKINS". They leap aside as the ground swells beneath
           their feet, and the DEAD JUDGE punches through the dirt,
           bolt upright. His face wears a rictus grin and he looms
           over the boys like the Grim Reaper in a powdered wig.
           He tilts his head curiously when he sees the book in
           Alvin's hand, and HISSES through yellowed teeth.
           Norman makes a last ditch attempt at reading the book as
           the Dead Judge approaches, the other zombies gathering
           behind him.

                          NORMAN
           Once upon a time in a far-off...
           Once upon a... In a...

                          ALVIN

                          NORMAN
           It's not working!
           The Dead Judge gives a hideous GROWL, but Norman frowns,
           confused, because he can hear words.

                          DEAD JUDGE

           STOP!... YOU... MUST... STOP!

           Survival instincts finally kick in and Alvin makes a run
           for it, scrambling through the graves toward the gate.

                          NORMAN
           Wait!
           Norman follows, leapfrogging over headstones.

           help me? Please?
           Mitch gets an eyeful of her best damsel in distress act,
           then SIGHS.

                          MITCH
           Okay... I guess I should go get
           some clothes on.
           Courtney gives a disappointed WHINE as he heads off down
           the hall, shoving Neil's head as he goes.

                          NEIL

           The front door is kicked open and Norman and a near
           hysterical Alvin rush inside, slamming and locking the
           door behind them.

                          ALVIN
           Are they gonna try to eat our
           brains?!

                          NORMAN
           I think you'll be safe.

           He manages to think this through, and frowns.
           Alvin watches curiously as Norman turns his attention to
           the book, frowning as he runs his hand over the embossed
           leather cover.

                          NORMAN
           I don't get it! Why didn't it
           work?
           He opens the book and leafs through page after page of
           ornate calligraphy and woodcut illustrations.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           "The Story of Sleeping Beauty".
           This doesn't make any sense!
           His mind racing, Norman heads off along the hallway.

           The room remains as before, with Mr Prenderghast's corpse
           lying on the floor. Norman enters with purpose and
           approaches it, leaving Alvin horrified in the doorway.
           Norman crouches low over the body, holding the book out
           in front of Mr Prenderghast's blank eyes.

                          NORMAN
           Mr Prenderghast, I don't
           understand! Tell me what to do!

                          ALVIN

           He told me to read from the book
           to stop the curse! I thought it
           was a spell or something, but...
           Norman narrows his eyes as he sees Mr Prenderghast's
           desk, still strewn with pictures and newspaper clippings.
           He hurries over and begins rummaging through the mess,
           scattering papers across the floor.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Come on! There has to be
           something...

           Something CLUNKS loudly from down the hall, sending Alvin
           into a desperate babbling panic.

                          ALVIN (CONT'D)
           We gotta defend ourselves! We
           gotta shoot them in the head with
           like silver stakes or something!
           I'm way too awesome to get eaten!
           Norman, are you listening to me?
           You really have to do something!
           Norman uncovers a couple of faded photographs of the old
           graveyard. One is of the seven tombstones, the other is
           of the stone marker, which reads "HERE LIES BURIED THE

           SEVEN VICTIMS OF THE WITCH'S CURSE..."
           Beside the photos is a torn page from an old book. An
           engraving illustrates the seven members of the witch's
           trial, solemnly seated at a bench within the courthouse.

                          NORMAN
           Seven victims...
           Frowning, Norman glances up and sees a page from an old
           book tacked to the wall. It is an illustration of a
           hideous old crone, cackling evilly.
           Another THUMP from down the hall.
           Norman looks again from the photographs in his hand to
           the image of the old witch. There's something he's not
           seeing... He looks at the pictures in front of him.
           Graves. Jurors. Witch.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)

           He turns to Alvin.

           I was reading the book in the
           wrong place!
           Down the hallway, another loud THUMP.

           as a mottled hand punches it right through the wood.
           A figure limps slowly into the hallway, dragging one
           crippled foot behind the other. It stops halfway along
           and tilts its head, as if listening, and emits a dire
           MOAN. More shapes appear behind it in the doorway and fan
           out along the hallway.

           The boys tremble in their hiding places trying not to
           make a sound; Alvin crouched behind a stack of books and
           Norman lying underneath the bed. The footsteps grow
           louder as the zombies shuffle into the room.
           NORMAN'S POV - rotten legs step up to Mr Prenderghast's
           body, lying where he fell on the floorboards. Two
           withered feet suddenly step right up to the bed.
           Something drops onto the floor inches in front of
           Norman's face with an unpleasant SLAP. Norman's eyes bug
           out as he realizes it is a zombie's dislodged ear. A
           weltered arm reaches down to grope around for the body
           part, until Norman pushes the ear, as carefully as he can
           manage, back into the zombie's fingers. The hand retreats
           back out from under the bed.
           There is a loud SCREAM as Alvin, unable to contain
           himself any longer, jumps out from his hiding place and
           makes for the door. The corpses look up as he disappears
           down the hall, then stagger after him.
           Norman takes this chance to follow, but the Dead Judge
           blocks his exit. They both stand quite still, staring
           into each others' eyes. The corpse tilts its head, almost
           quizzically, and its eyes widen as it notices the book
           under his arm.
           Norman steps sideways to run past it, but the corpse does
           too. Both it and Norman step one way, then the other, and
           back again. Norman feigns one direction and quickly bolts
           in the other, past the corpse and out the door.

           in front of him is another zombie on the doorstep,
           opening a mouth full of jagged teeth.
           Alvin SCREAMS like a little girl, smacks it ineffectually
           with his spatula, and the door is abruptly SLAMMED in the
           zombie's face, a surprised and muffled GROAN coming from
           the other side.

           The Dead Judge leads the advance of zombies down the hall
           toward them. Norman hears his MOAN.
           Norman swings the door back open, the zombie on the other
           side moving with it, teeth firmly embedded in the wood.
           As it attempts to pry itself free, Norman grabs Alvin by
           the arm and they both dart onto the porch behind its
           back, headed for the road.

           swerves around them and grazes the trees, the side mirror
           flying off as it hits a branch.
           Mitch fights to control the van as Courtney SCREAMS.

           Shaken, Mitch realizes another figure is looming out of

           stock still as the van plows straight into him.

           still on the moonlit road. He nervously jogs over to it.
           As he gets closer, Mitch can see the man more clearly. He
           is wrapped in filthy tattered clothing of a bygone era
           and is covered in dirt. Flies BUZZ around him.

                          MITCH
           Er... hello, sir?
           He hunkers down and is immediately hit by the stench. A
           mud-encrusted face stares up at him.

           He's still breathing!
           Mitch reaches out to gently lift the figure's head but as
           he does, there is a CRUNCH and it comes off in his hands.

                          COURTNEY

           Does anyone know CPR?
           Further down the road, Norman runs back toward the van,
           Alvin still in tow. He sees Mitch ahead of him, getting
           dizzily to his feet, still holding the head.

           The head in Mitch's hands suddenly GASPS again, opening
           its mouth. Mitch SHRIEKS as the headless figure on the

           SPLUTTER as they cough up what's left of their lungs.
           They turn from one to the other, awaiting direction from
           their leader. But the Dead Judge is nowhere to be seen.
           A zombie points down the winding road where the woods
           eventually thin out into leafy suburban drives. The
           ragged shape of the Judge is clinging to the back of the
           van, thrashing around and WAILING as it picks up speed.
           The zombies quietly watch until the van moves out of
           sight behind the trees, then turn their attention to the
           lights of the town center below them. They weigh up their
           options and, MOANING, shuffle toward civilization.

           Further down the hill, Sheriff Hooper is taking a break
           from ticketing borderline traffic violations by drinking
           a giant malt shake in a plastic cup. She leans against
           her parked motorcycle, squinting up at the unnatural

           The Dead Judge leans further into the van, MOANING

           He stares down at it, wide-eyed, as it wriggles like an
           animal in his grasp.
           The Dead Judge slides slowly down the windscreen of the

           The arm frees itself from Neil and turns on Norman,
           leaping at him like a viper.
           Norman holds the book up as a shield, and manages to swat
           the zombie arm away, flipping it across the front seat,
           where it lands on the back of Mitch's neck.
           Mitch SCREAMS as the rotten hand clamps down onto the top
           of his head, and madly tries to shake it off. It hangs
           onto him grimly, bony fingers hooked around his nostrils.
           With Mitch no longer steering, the van swerves crazily
           across the road, shaking the Dead Judge off the

           through cookie-cutter back yards.

           It bounces down the hill, flipping over and over, the
           kids inside tossed around like rag dolls.
           Somewhat the worse for wear, it eventually comes to a
           stop in a parking lot, neatly crashing into an empty
           space.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           The kids clamber out of the far side of the van.

                          MITCH
           Oh my gosh! I'm gonna be sick!

                          COURTNEY
           Oh, I broke a nail!
           As Alvin climbs out, he gingerly holds up the Judge's
           arm, as if it were a dead animal, and dangles it limply
           in front of his face.

                          ALVIN
           Yeah! Alvin the zombie slayer! I
           got you...
           The hand suddenly bends back on itself, slaps him on the
           face, and as he SQUEALS it drops to the ground and
           skitters away into the shadows.
           Mitch sizes up what's left of his van, and bids a tearful
           farewell.

                          MITCH

                          (WHISPERS)
           Baby, I'm so sorry. You'll be
           alright. We're gonna get through
           this together.
           Courtney pouts moodily when she realizes the tender words
           aren't for her.
           Norman looks up at the sky. A thick bank of cloud looms
           over the town, and in its center is the unmistakable
           otherworldly face, ebbing in and out of visibility, and
           grinning horribly.

                          NORMAN
           Uh oh. C'mon!

           follow Norman out of the parking lot.

           EXT. MAIN STREET ALLEYWAY - SOME TIME LATER

           The town center retains even less charm when the sun goes
           down, and its remaining denizens are now drunk, high or
           looking for trouble. Provided one requires alcohol, junk
           food or pharmaceuticals, it's the place to be.
           A ruddy-faced drunk, SLOB GUY, inserts a few coins in a
           vending machine at the end of an alley, and waits as the
           metal coil inside curls a candy bar toward the front of
           the machine. The man notices the approaching figures
           further down the back street and frowns.
           He turns back to the machine, waiting. The zombies draw
           closer, GROANING, and the man fidgets uncomfortably.
           The man begins WHIMPERING. The candy bar slowly shifts
           forward. The zombies are close enough to touch.
           The man YELLS and runs away, leaving the candy bar to
           drop to the machine's trough with a CLANG.
           A beat then, still SCREAMING, the man runs back to the
           machine, grabs his candy, then runs away again.
           The Undead emerge onto Main Street, and slow down as they
           take in their surroundings.
           VARIOUS ANGLES ON the garish town center nightlife
           intercut with CLOSE-UPS of the wide-eyed zombies.
           -Two teenage girls in mini-skirts walk along the curb. A
           pickup truck crawls by, driven by red necks who wolf-
           whistle and gesture rudely. The girls GIGGLE.
           -In the nearby "GOBBLER'S" parking lot, a huge woman sits
           in her vehicle cramming a burger into her mouth. As she
           bites down ketchup spatters across the inside of the
           windscreen like arterial spray.
           -A corpse stands agog before a billboard. The poster is
           for a line of "Lady Luck" lingerie and features a buxom
           woman in her underwear draped over a roulette wheel. The
           tagline is "FANCY YOUR CHANCES?" The corpse's one eye
           pops out of its socket and dangles by its optic nerve.
           -Outside the Bar Gento, LOUD MUSIC and raucous revelry
           blare out into the street.
           ParaNorman 58.

                         93 CONTINUED: 93
           -A group of loitering teens cluster in a group, some
           sitting upon a stolen shopping cart, others kicking a tin
           can from one to the other. One daubs misspelled naughty
           words on the wall beside them. Another is attempting to
           use his bare hands to rip open a parking meter.
           -Another corpse stands in the light of a store window, a
           bank of TVs showing all kinds of programs. Racing car
           explosions; scantily-clad singers gyrating in music
           videos; talking animals and Viagra commercials.
           QUICK CUTS OF ZOMBIE CLOSE-UPS as they all raise rotten
           fingers to their mouths and SCREAM.
           Slob Guy suddenly bursts out of the door of the Bar
           Gento, dragging a group of dubious drinkers.

                          SLOB GUY
           See! I told you! Zombies! It's the
           witch's curse!
           Everyone in the street freezes in place, wide-eyed.
           Someone GASPS.

                          SWEET GIRL
           Mama?

                          RAPPER GUY
           What?
           A couple of the zombies exchange glances, waiting for the
           other shoe to drop.

                          GUCCI LADY
           What should we do?
           Barely skipping a beat, the townsfolk shift seamlessly
           from shock and awe to bullish aggression.
           Crystal pulls a pump-action shotgun from somewhere about
           her person and scowls menacingly.

                          CRYSTAL
           Kill them in the head!
           Within seconds, the seedy-looking townsfolk have armed
           themselves with pool cues, mops, toilet plungers and any
           other household implements that can be waved
           threateningly, and the mob advances on the group of
           quivering zombies.

           The disembodied Judge's arm skitters along a secluded
           street, eventually coming upon the rest of the Dead
           Judge, sitting in the gutter trying to arrange and re-
           attach his body parts in the right places.

           Having SNAPPED his head back onto his neck, the Judge

           feet.

                          NORMAN
           Hurry! This way!
           Norman leads the way, but stops dead as they run headlong
           into a scene of zombie invasion mayhem.
           Townsfolk fill the streets, SHOUTING and acting generally
           mob-like. One or two of them have even got hold of
           burning torches from somewhere. It's apocalyptic chaos.
           The fat woman from the Drive-Thru runs past SCREAMING,
           her face and T-shirt covered in blood-red ketchup.

                          COURTNEY
           Oh, this is awful! The zombies
           are, like, eating everyone!
           Norman points beyond the bedlam to the dark shape of the
           Old Town Hall in the plaza.

                          NORMAN
           C'mon!
           They skirt around the edge of Main Street, avoiding
           flying bottles and limbs as best they can.
           Following the noise, the Judge staggers along some way
           behind. He surveys the scene as he emerges, his
           featureless face doing a nevertheless effective job of
           expressing horrified shock.
           After a moment, he comes to his senses, and spies the
           kids in the distance. A look of resolve crosses his face,
           turning quickly to surprise as a SHOT rings out nearby.
           The Judge looks down to a large hole blown through his
           midriff. Framed within it is Crystal, several feet away,
           rifle smoking. He looks up again, weighs up his chances,
           then lets out a ROAR of retreat to his beleaguered
           companions before running off into the shadows.
           Those zombies who haven't already tried to run for cover
           manage to extricate themselves from the frenzy and follow
           the Judge's CRY, some of them breaking into a sprint.

           It is an old timber building, surrounded by graceless
           modern office blocks around the cobbled square.
           The kids race across the plaza, pausing to catch their
           breath at the ugly witch statue in front of the Town
           Hall. They GASP as they slow their pace.

                          NORMAN
           Is everyone alright? Nobody got
           bitten?
           Neil flops down heavily against the statue, panting and
           holding his mouth.

           Norman moves toward the steps leading up to the Town
           Hall's doors, the rest of the gang falling into line
           behind him.
           Another flash of lightning paints the kids' shadows
           across the width of the square. Norman nervously watches
           the clouds above them.

                          NORMAN
           Does anyone know how to pick a
           lock?
           Everyone immediately looks at Alvin.

                          ALVIN
           Sure. Picking locks is my thing.
           Alvin walks over to a notice board beside the door, upon
           which is a poster for a "CRIME PREVENTION SEMINAR". He
           yanks it out of the ground, hefts it through the window,
           then reaches through to unfasten the door latch.

           The door swings open and reveals a labyrinth of shelves

           front of him. Row after row of dusty cardboard file boxes
           and ledgers stacked one on top of another.
           Norman stops in his tracks, color draining from his face.

                          NORMAN
           Uh-oh.

           Neil is more optimistic, and brightly makes his way over
           to a shelf, and pulls down a slim ledger.

           This'll be a piece of cake, you'll
           see.
           He pauses, and frowns, squinting up his eyes as he reads

           Mitch hefts a particularly heavy box file off a shelf. He

           then ignores them and begins curling it like a dumbbell.

           Crystal turns and fires into the street, taking out a

           In the alley down the side of the old Town Hall, the
           zombies tiptoe through the shadows. They look slightly
           the worse for wear; some have lost limbs, others have
           large holes in them. One has a toilet plunger stuck on
           her head.
           The Dead Judge looks up at the sky. The turgid
           supernatural storm RUMBLES closer, pressing down upon the
           nearby rooftops.
           The Judge motions to the other zombies to hurry, and
           grabs hold of the Town Hall's side door. He rips it open,
           and furtively motions the zombies to file inside.

           I saw them! I saw them! The
           zombies are in the Town Hall!
           The information sweeps across the crowd like wildfire.
           Several faces turn to Henscher, who is pleased to have an
           engaged audience and hams it up shamelessly, coming on
           like Braveheart in curlers.

           Mrs Henscher points the crowd toward the Town Hall.
           Despite Hooper's protests, the townsfolk are on lynch mob
           auto pilot and surge like a force of nature along the

           Dozens of books and cardboard boxes lie scattered across
           the floor. The glass cabinets around the room have been
           ransacked as the kids drag documents off shelves and
           rummage through binders.
           Norman sits on the floor flipping through sheet after
           sheet of records. Courtney wades through documents toward
           him, holding up a fist full of old rolled-up papers.

                          COURTNEY
           We're not going to find it in

           reading involved, I would have
           brought a completely different
           group of people who hate me.
           Neil suddenly YELLS out victoriously. Everyone turns to
           him, hardly believing he might have found the answer. He
           waves a book triumphantly above his head and grins at

           Norman looks at the faces in front of him. The kids are
           scared and confused and angry. Even Neil has nothing
           encouraging to offer.
           Norman's brow furrows.

                          NORMAN
           You never listen! No one ever
           listens! I'm scared too, but I've
           still gotta do this.

           I'm not going anywhere. You can't

           Mitch shrugs and picks his brother up, scooping him under
           one arm and carrying him out the door.

           Norman watches the doors shut behind them, and his anger

           The book in his hand is now a blackened cinder with a
           large smoldering hole gouged through the middle.
           Norman realizes he is no longer inside the burning
           building. Around him indistinct shapes begin to pool into
           clarity. He is in the courthouse, but three hundred years
           ago, and a trial is about to begin.
           A crowd of onlookers gather around a platform at the head
           of the room where officious-looking gentlemen in austere
           Puritan clothing stand around a table. Two dour men in
           black skull caps are seated, an empty chair between them.
           Norman moves unnoticed through the crowd toward the
           platform. The hubbub of the townsfolk dies down.
           The imposing figure of Judge Hopkins, tall and august,
           marches out of a side chamber, steps up onto the wooden
           dais and seats himself silently between his solemn peers.
           He glares down at Norman with cold, humorless eyes.

           Agatha Prenderghast of his
           Majesty's Province of
           Massachusetts...
           As the Judge's voice continues, Norman sees played out
           against it a MONTAGE of the preceding court case.
           The notary stands up, waving a wad of testimonies.

           JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           ...on this day you have been
           arraigned for the horrible crime
           of witchcraft...
           A pale woman fiddles nervously with the ribbon on her
           bonnet as she is questioned by the Judge.

           JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           ...witnessed by those whose
           testimonies have been heard.
           A wiry woman with a pinched face gestures fearfully with
           her arms as she recounts her evidence.

           JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           You have, by this court, been
           found guilty...

                          NORMAN
           No!
           A young farmhand bows his head shamefully, as he adds
           further ammunition to the prosecution.

           JUDGE HOPKINS (V.O.)
           ...and it is passed on you,
           according to your grievous
           crimes...
           Another village woman SOBS into a handkerchief as she
           tells her story.
           QUICK CUTS of the accusers, one after the other, as the
           Judge finishes his verdict. The notary, the preacher, the
           townsfolk. All point at Norman.

           JUDGE HOPKINS (CONT'D)
           ...execution.
           Camera swings slowly around Norman to reveal AGGIE
           PRENDERGHAST, standing in chains right behind him.

                          AGGIE
           No!
           Norman reacts with horror. The "witch" cowering next to
           him is no more than eleven years-old. Her long hair is
           unkempt and dirt on her face is streaked with tears from
           her eyes. Her manacles have been specially made to fit
           her tiny wrists, and weigh her to the floor. She SNIFFS,
           scared and confused.

                          JUDGE HOPKINS
           Do you have anything to say for
           yourself?

                          AGGIE
           I was only playing!

                          JUDGE HOPKINS
           Aye, with fire! You were speaking
           with the dead!
           The crowd GASPS and MURMURS fearfully.

           JUDGE HOPKINS (CONT'D)
           I'll not risk damnation on these
           good people.
           The town Sheriff grabs Aggie by the shoulder.

           of execution where you will be
           hanged by the neck until you be
           dead...
           Norman shouts out but no one can hear or see him.

                          NORMAN
           Wait! No! You can't do this!
           The grim-faced Sheriff moves toward Norman and Aggie. She
           backs away, tears flowing down her face.

                          AGGIE
           I didn't do anything wrong!
           A terrible panic comes over her face.

                          AGGIE (CONT'D)
           Stop! Leave me alone or I'll make
           you sorry! I'll make all of you
           sorry!
           Norman feels unsteady on his feet, the room seeming to
           spin around him. The faces of the townsfolk, pale and
           skull-like, swirl around and around, blurring together.
           In the center of it all, glowing like a bonfire, Aggie

           SCREAMS.
           The world turns black and Norman collapses in a faint.

           NORMAN'S P.O.V. - the high timbers of the hall roof swim
           into focus, and then faces peering down at him. Skeletal,
           rotting faces. The dead Puritans are standing around him
           in a half-circle. He sits up terrified, and looks around,
           shuffling back across the floorboards on his bottom. The
           dead villagers stand where they are, staring intently.
           Norman sits a moment, heart pounding, WHISPERING SHAKILY.

                          NORMAN
           How could you?! She was just a
           little kid! She was no different
           than me!
           The Dead Judge takes a step forward.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Keep away from me!
           The Dead Judge stops, then opens his horrible mouth and
           speaks in a guttural voice.

           A beat. Norman is stunned.

                          NORMAN
           What? You don't want to kill me?
           The Judge shakes his head and points down at the book
           beside Norman's feet.

                          DEAD JUDGE
           You can speak to the dead. To us.
           To her. We need you to read from
           the book to send us all back to
           the grave.

                          NORMAN
           But it didn't work! It's a fairy
           tale! Just a bedtime... story...
           He narrows his eyes at the Judge.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           That's it, isn't it? A bedtime
           story to keep a little girl asleep
           for another year. And now you need
           my help because I'm the only one
           who can read it to her!
           He bends down to pick it up. His eyes flash angrily at
           the zombies and he hurls the burnt book at the Judge. It
           hits him in the chest and falls to his feet with a THUD.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Here's your book! Try reading it
           yourself!
           The zombies stare down at the blackened lump of charred
           paper, and several of them GASP. The Dead Judge's eyes
           are filled with fear and desperation.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           Why did you do it?

                          DEAD JUDGE
           We were scared.

                          NORMAN
           Of what?

                          DEAD JUDGE
           Of her.

                          (GESTURES BEHIND)

           DEAD JUDGE (CONT'D)
           Please help us.
           Norman looks at the book of fairy tales, lying at his
           feet. Its pages are curled and blackened, embers still
           glowing around the hole blown right through it.

                          NORMAN
           Every year someone reads the story
           at her grave. Before me it was Mr
           Prenderghast, and before him there
           were others, but the curse doesn't
           ever go away. Nothing gets better.
           It's not enough.
           Norman looks at it a moment, thinking. He knows what he
           has to do.

           What will you do?

           INT. TOWN HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Smeared with soot and COUGHING, the kids are trapped in
           the lobby. They cower together as burning wood CREAKS and
           CRACKS all around them. The air is grey and caustic and
           filled with flakes of charcoal and burning ash.
           A burning timber GROANS as it splits from the ceiling and
           tumbles toward the children. They SCREAM and scatter as
           it hits the floorboards in a shower of glowing sparks.
           Mitch shouts out from beside a heavy wooden counter top.

                          MITCH
           Guys! Guys! Under here! Under
           here!
           The kids scramble beneath the shelter of the counter as
           more glowing embers rain down around them.
           Courtney grabs Mitch by the bicep and whispers weakly.

                          COURTNEY
           Mitch, if we die tonight, this
           might be the last chance I get to

           Uh, well, no. Unless we get
           brought back as zombies, and then
           technically you'll have longer.
           Courtney opens her mouth to continue, but her love train
           is thoroughly derailed by the nearby CRASH of breaking
           wood, and the archive door beside them CLATTERS to the
           ground.
           The cowering kids all watch in silent horror as several
           dark figures limp and shamble out of the smoke and make
           their way past them across the room. It's the zombies,
           and they're being led by Norman.

                          COURTNEY

           EXT. TOWN HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           A loud THUD from within the Town Hall causes the gathered
           crowd outside to GASP, and those closest to the doors to
           take a few steps back.
           The crowd GASPS again as the charred front door of the
           Town Hall is wrenched off its hinges by a huge piece of
           timber and CRASHES down the steps in a shower of flaming
           splinters.
           A ripple of shock runs through the crowd as a number of
           skeletal figures emerge, SPLUTTERING and WHEEZING through
           the smoke, shielding their faces from the heat.
           The gathered crowd are even more aghast when they realize
           a child is being guided out of the flames by the zombies.
           Unseen by the crowd, Courtney and the other kids crawl to
           the splintered opening of the front door, blinking and
           COUGHING for air.
           Hooper pulls out her gun and marches toward the zombies.

           The zombies stop on the steps, burning building behind
           them and the hostile townsfolk in front of them. Norman
           pushes through and stands firmly in the way of Hooper's
           gun, arms spread defensively.

                          NORMAN
           Wait!
           Courtney and the other kids GASP as they watch from

           are trying to hurt you? They're

           be. Just stupid people who should

           They did something unforgivable
           because they were scared, and they
           were cursed for it. Now it's

           Across the crowd, weapons are being lowered and faces are
           starting to look a little guilty.
           There is silence as the modern townsfolk stare at the
           line of three hundred year-old townsfolk. Throughout the
           crowd various weapons CLATTER as they hit the ground.
           A small girl tiptoes up the steps and silently offers one
           of the zombies his arm back.
           The quiet is shattered by a deafening SCREAM. It blows
           out of the storm clouds and whips through the plaza on a
           hellish wind. The street lamps around the square shatter
           in bursts of sparks, raining down on the amassed people.
           The sky above is blood red, clouds twisting and
           contorting into a vast unnatural vortex.
           The Town Hall erupts in a fireball, tongues of white fire
           ROARING out of the embers as the ground shakes and the
           crowd scatters in terror.
           Neil turns to Norman as they duck for cover behind a
           parked car, and SHOUTS over the noise of the wind.

                          NEIL
           Jeez, what is her problem?
           Norman takes in the chaos around them...

           -An arc of white lightning hits the base of the witch's
           statue with a CRACK. With a terrible GROAN, the statue is
           lifted up into the air by the supernatural wind. It
           CRASHES down at the foot of the Town Hall steps,
           shattering into a hundred pieces of rubble.
           -Windows blow out of tacky tourist stores, their cheap
           front displays ripped apart by the wind.
           -A bolt of lightning tears through the huge billboard in
           the plaza, ripping apart the idealized image of the
           town's history in a spiral of splintered wood.
           Norman struggles over to where a group of townsfolk and
           zombies cower from the destruction. Sandra runs over to
           her son and hugs him.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Oh, Norman!

                          NEIL
           So what do we do now?

                          NORMAN
           I... I really don't know...

                          COURTNEY
           Yes you do, Norman! You've got to
           get to that witch's grave!

           But...

                          COURTNEY
           But nothing! You listen to me,
           buster, we didn't turn away when
           Daleridge High was slaughtering
           our volleyball team, did we?

                          NORMAN
           I thought we did.

                          COURTNEY
           No we didn't. I've cheered the
           uncheerable, Norman, and I'm not
           letting you give up now!
           Norman turns to Perry, his eyes all business.

                          NORMAN
           Dad, could I borrow the car?

           INT. STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS

           The Dead Judge sits rigidly between Norman and Courtney
           in the back of Perry's station wagon, Perry and Sandra in
           the front.
           Perry drives in silent discomfort following the Judge's
           instructions through town, glancing in his rear-view
           mirror at the passengers in the back seat.
           Sandra takes a small perfume spritzer from her purse as
           surreptitiously as she can and sprays the air around her.

           The car turns a corner into the path of an overturned
           truck, caught by the spectral wind. It cartwheels down
           the middle of the street, tearing up the asphalt.

                         

           I/E. STATION WAGON - CONTINUOUS
           Perry swerves out of its path of destruction.
           Inside, Sandra cranes her neck around to watch the truck
           CRASH down the road behind them. She faces front again.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Boy, the traffic tonight!

                          COURTNEY

           seat!

                          NORMAN
           She wants you to move over.
           The Judge MUMBLES.

                          COURTNEY
           I heard that! Mom! Tell the zombie
           to stop saying stuff about me!

                          NORMAN
           Can you quit using the "z" word?

           After a moment, the Judge lets out a sepulchral MOAN.

                          NORMAN
           He says "take a left here".
           Perry gives a distasteful look, but turns the steering
           wheel. He peers out through the raging storm, windscreen
           wiper batting ineffectively at the onslaught of debris.

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           We've already been this way. We're

           someone?

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           Oh, right, you think maybe we
           should stop at a graveyard and dig
           up some other eighteenth-century
           corpses?

                          SANDRA BABCOCK

           Please don't tell me he needs to
           use the bathroom.
           Norman listens as the Judge continues GRUMBLING, then
           leans forward over his father's seat, pointing.

                          NORMAN

           The car turns tightly off a secluded road onto a dirt
           path running into the thick of the surrounding woodland.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK

          139 EXT. OLD FOREST TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER 139

           The headlights of the car illuminate a huge fallen trunk
           ahead along the path, and Perry pulls the car to a stop,
           wheels CRUNCHING on dirt and roots.
           Everyone gets out of the car. The trees around them are
           thick and dense. Aggie's furious storm WHISTLES through
           the branches far above them.
           Norman turns to the Dead Judge. The Judge nods solemnly,
           pointing ahead.
           Norman steels himself and begins to march forward through
           the thick brambles, the others following behind.

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           So, why are we here?

                          NORMAN
           Someone's gotta talk to her, Dad.

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           Yeah, um, why's that person you,
           exactly?
           As they continue, the surrounding trees press in on them,
           just like in Norman's vision. Branches and thorns lash at
           their faces while thick roots entangle their feet.
           Norman's family are falling behind and realize too late
           that the encroaching trees are about to crush Norman.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Oh my goodness, look out!

                          NORMAN
           Mom!

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Perry! Do something!
           Perry is finding it difficult to move; a tree bears down
           on him, its roots snagging his thrashing limbs.

                          PERRY BABCOCK
           I'm trying!

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Kick it in the knothole!
           Norman hops nimbly between two huge trunks as they SMASH
           together, blocking off the way ahead with gnarled wood.
           Sandra struggles free and shouts over the branches.

           SANDRA BABCOCK (CONT'D)

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Be careful!
           Now separated from the others, Norman turns to go ahead
           on his own. Ahead of him a phosphorescent glow shines off
           the trees, and he knows he is very close.

           EXT. OLD FOREST CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

           Exhausted but determined, Norman finds the source of the
           supernatural storm; a clearing sculpted out of the forest
           by Aggie's fury.
           In the center of it all is the tree, bleached white as
           bone and grotesquely twisted. The trees around it CREAK
           and GROAN as though they'd like to uproot and plant
           themselves someplace else.
           Beneath this tree lie Aggie's remains, buried three
           hundred years ago. Now a mess of roots and rocks open out
           like an ugly wound, and within them a tiny childlike
           figure is barely visible through a spitting furnace of
           spectral energy. Ectoplasm rages up around the tree's
           finger-like branches like a mushroom cloud of negative
           energy. It's a child's tantrum turned atomic.

                          NORMAN
           Hello?
           Words echo around him in response.

                          AGGIE
           You're not welcome here. Go away.
           Norman shivers as the voice RUMBLES coldly.
           The raging wind intensifies as Norman turns back around.

                          NORMAN
           Uh... I really need to speak with
           you.

                          AGGIE
           Who are you?

                          NORMAN
           I'm Norman. Norman Babcock. You
           don't actually know me, but I know
           you. We're actually kind of the
           same, you and I.
           Norman takes another step closer, ducking as petrified
           branches and rocks fly over his head on the wind.

                          AGGIE
           You're not like me at all.
           Norman hesitates, knowing he's on dangerous ground.

           What?

                          NORMAN
           And I know you're probably tired.
           Right? Because, I mean, it's
           really late and it's been a long
           night and we're, like, only eleven
           years-old, and...
           The voice snaps back like a clap of thunder.

                          AGGIE
           I don't want to go to sleep, and
           you can't make me! I burnt the
           book into dust, and now I don't
           have to listen to that stupid
           story any more! Leave me alone!
           Norman is terrified, but advances on the tree, the rocks
           under his feet churning.

           A little girl who was different
           from the other people in her
           village.
           The voice chants petulantly over him as if putting its
           demonic fingers in its ears.

           She could see and do things that
           no one could understand, and that
           made them scared of her.

           I don't like this story!

                          NORMAN
           She turned away from everyone, and
           became sad and lonely, and had no
           one to turn to.

                          AGGIE
           Stop it!
           If Aggie weren't floating three feet above the ground,
           she'd be stamping her feet. Her voice blows bits of bark
           off the surrounding trees.

                          NORMAN
           But the more she turned away from
           people, the more scared they were
           of her, and they did something
           terrible!
           Arcs of white energy CRACKLE through the air. Where they
           hit the ground, they send up white flames.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           They became so scared that they

           You're a bully.

                          AGGIE
           No I'm not!
           Norman has almost reached the eye of the storm. The world
           behind him is a whirling torrent of burning white chaos.

                          NORMAN
           They did something awful, but that
           doesn't mean you should too!

           All that's left of you now is mean
           and horrible!
           He sees her clearly now. True, she is floating above the
           ground, and her hair is writhing madly about her, and
           plumes of spectral fire are pouring off her body, but
           she's still just a little girl underneath.

                          AGGIE
           That's not true!
           Norman climbs up a tree root, Aggie's flames searing his
           skin and clothes as he gets close enough to touch her.

                          NORMAN
           Then stop. This is wrong and you
           know it! You've spent so long
           remembering the bad people that
           you've forgotten the good ones.
           There must have been someone who
           loved you and cared for you. You
           don't remember them?

                          AGGIE
           Leave me alone!

                          NORMAN
           But you're not alone! You have to
           remember!

                          AGGIE
           Keep away from me!
           Norman reaches the end of the root and jumps. His
           outstretched fingers shake madly as they approach Aggie's
           tiny hand, as though the air is fighting against him.

                          NORMAN
           Remember!
           There is a flash of white, and silence.

           EXT. NEW FOREST CLEARING - BRIGHT SUNNY DAY

           Dappled sunlight falls through shimmering leaves and
           blossoms. Norman and Aggie are standing in thick grass,
           replete with wild flowers, the dead white tree now quite
           alive and blossoming behind them.
           Aggie is no longer an indistinct specter, but flesh and
           blood and as real as Norman. She stares down at her hand
           as Norman holds it gently by the end of her finger.

                          AGGIE
           Aggie. My name was Aggie.
           ParaNorman 89.

                         141 CONTINUED: 141
           A brightly-colored butterfly flutters between them. Aggie
           starts to remember as she follows its flight.

                          AGGIE (CONT'D)
           I... I remember my mommy brought
           me here once. We sat under the
           tree and she told me stories. They
           all had happy endings.

                          (BROW FURROWS)
           And then those horrible men came
           and took me away and I never saw
           her again!
           She scowls angrily at the butterfly flitting past her
           face. It instantly crumples up into ashes. Surprised, she
           GASPS and watches the blackened dust fall to the ground.
           There's anger in Aggie, but there is confusion, sadness
           and regret there too. She isn't quite so scary anymore.

                          NORMAN
           Sometimes when people get scared
           they say and do terrible things. I
           think you got so scared, that you
           forgot who you are. But I don't
           think you're a witch. Not really.
           Aggie looks into his eyes.

                          AGGIE
           You don't?

                          NORMAN
           I think you're just a little kid
           with a really special gift who
           only ever wanted people to
           understand her.
           He smiles softly.

                          NORMAN (CONT'D)
           So we're not all that different at
           all.

                          AGGIE
           But what about the people who hurt
           you? Don't you ever want to make
           them suffer?
           Norman thinks this over, and shrugs.

                          NORMAN
           Well, yeah, but what good would
           that do? You think just because
           there's bad people out there that
           there's no good ones either? I
           thought the same thing.

           Somewhere.
           Aggie frowns, looking lost.

                          AGGIE
           I just want my mommy...

                          NORMAN
           I'm sorry, Aggie. She's gone.

                          AGGIE
           That story you were telling. How
           does it end?

                          NORMAN
           I think that's up to you.
           Aggie blinks through tears at the grass beneath her feet.

                          AGGIE
           Is this where they buried me?

                          NORMAN
           It's a pretty good place to sleep.
           Then you can be with your mom
           again.
           Aggie holds Norman's gaze, then looks down to the ground,
           her tiny frame heaving with a last SOB. She sits down on
           the grass and curls up, resting her head on her hands.
           Norman kneels down next to her as she closes her eyes.
           Her breathing grows deeper and more peaceful; her tiny
           frame shifting softly under her long hair.
           The air around them grows blurry and indistinct. Aggie
           softens as though out of focus, and the whole world
           becomes a swirling dance of glowing orbs. Norman closes
           his eyes as a blizzard of light engulfs him, spiraling up
           into the clouds high above his head.
           Lightning flashes white far above and thunder RUMBLES
           softly through the sky, as if moving away.

           The zombies form a group in the center of the square, all
           of them looking up into the clouds. The people around
           them stop and stare, awestruck as a breeze buffets their
           clothes and the air around them begins to shimmer.
           As the modern townsfolk watch on, some of the zombies
           take each others' arms for support. Those with eyelids
           close them. One by one their bodies dissolve away,
           leaving ethereal figures in their place.

           For a moment they float where they stood, ghostly
           apparitions of the people they once were before the
           curse. They stare sadly out at their flesh and blood
           descendents, and in an instant become just specks of
           light that are caught by the breeze and carried out of
           sight.

           Norman blinks open his eyes, taking a moment to survey
           the scene around him.
           He sits upon the upturned root of the tree, the earth
           around broken and twisted, a testament to what has
           happened. He looks up into the sky and gives a sad smile.

                          NORMAN
           Sleep tight.
           He clambers down through the roots back toward the path.

           Norman wearily walks through the splintered roots to find
           his family. Sandra shouts out when she sees him.

                          SANDRA BABCOCK
           Norman? Norman!
           Sandra runs over to him and scoops him up in her arms,
           hugging him tightly.

           Perry takes a deep breath and looks at his son. There is
           relief and a hint of admiration in his eyes.

           They watch in awe as the Judge begins to turn to dust,
           his ragged clothes and decayed body dissolving in the
           rain. For barely a moment a shimmering ghostly figure is
           left behind, an image of the man that once was. The
           spirit blinks sorrowful eyes, then becomes nothing more
           than a million glowing fragments dissipating on the
           breeze.

           The sky has lost its lurid pall, and the clouds are now
           lighter and less menacing.
           In the Town Square, clusters of townsfolk are trying to
           come to terms with the night's events.
           Norman weaves through the crowd away from the Babcock's
           station wagon, searching for Neil. He hears small
           snippets of conversation as he goes.

           Ow! That was my finger nail.
           Slob Guy, Crystal and Mrs Henscher are convincing each

           You know what it's like. You join
           a mob and you say things. I was
           merely inhabiting the role.

           Yeah, it was the others. They
           pushed me into it.
           Norman smiles as he passes Alvin, regaling a bunch of
           teenagers.

           Yeah, me and Norman are in a lot
           of the same classes. Pretty much
           inseparable. Best buds. And we do

           snacks. Sandra takes a seat on an armchair and Courtney
           lies down on the floor beside her brother, munching
