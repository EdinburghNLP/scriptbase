<b>	INT. LECTURE HALL BERKELEY - DAY
</b>
	The hall is full.  On the stage, DR. HELEN HUDSON is
	speaking.  HELEN is a forensic psychologist.  Behind her is
	a projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA,
	FANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and
	TRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser
	pointing device.  We see her from a considerable
	distance... the back of the balcony.  Her voice is crisp and
	assured.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Our society creates these socially
		and psychically disenfranchised
		men, and their revenge on society
		is terrible.  They are hard to
		catch.  They are "the nice guy next
		door," their employers -- if they
		work at all -- find them quiet and
		uncomplaining.  Early abuse and
		rejection have taught them
		passivity.  Only in their violent
		fantasies do they feel alive.  What
		they seek in their frenzied
		assaults on their victims is relief
		from passivity.  For these men, ten
		minutes relief is worth far more
		than the life of another human
		being.  Torture, the pain they
		inflict, the screams of the victim,
		are all part of the ritual that
		gives them a brief respite from
		their own psychic pain.  And then
		the depression, the forgetting, the
		feeling of sadness and despair
		begins the cycle all over again.
		Like addicts seeking their drug,
		Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,
		Berkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they
		seek out their next victim.

	During the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera
	has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the
	balcony railing.

<b>	CLOSEUP: HELEN
</b>
<b>				HELEN
</b>		The cycle is endless until they are
		caught.  And they are caught by
		chance -- they run a red light, and
		a body is in the trunk.  A leaking	
		pipe brings a plumber to a basement
		where they is the smell of death.

	Her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in
	the balcony... Her voice chokes off.  She stares.

<b>	HELEN'S POV:
</b>
	Sitting in the front row of the balcony, a YOUNG RED-HEADED
	MAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward, resting his tattooed
	arms on the railing.  He smiles intimately at HELEN.

	HELEN cuts her eyes to the left.  She sees:

	Backstage, an overweight COP in plain clothes.  Instantly
	alert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of
	exposing his presence to the audience.  A SECOND COP, in the
	wings on the other side of the stage, also springs to
	attention.  FIRST COP'S eyes follow HELEN'S...

	Their POV:  THE BALCONY - YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN is no longer
	there.

	HELEN  Can she believe her eyes?  Resumes:

<b>				HELEN
</b>		At any time, right now, as you
		listen, the FBI estimates there are
		30 to 35 serial killers stalking
		their victims.  The serial killer is
		a plaque that must be addressed not
		only by the law, but by science.
		Florida spent eight million dollars
		to execute Ted Bundy.  It would
		have been better spent building a
		forensic penal facility devoted to
		research.

	Once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself
	that the smiling man is not there...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Confined for life, without parole,
		and subjected to scientific study,
		these men's lives might finally, in
		some small measure, educate and
		thereby protect society.  Thank
		you.

	Applause as Helen warily checks for the TWO COPS.  They are
	carefully casing the crowd.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	LATER:
</b>
	The crowd is breaking up.  FIRST COP walks HELEN to the
	ladies' room.  People reach to shake Helen's hand; she copes 
	as well as she can with her fear.  THEY LEAVE THE STAGE
<b>	THROUGH A DOOR OPENING TO A CORRIDOR LEADING BACK TO
</b><b>	DRESSING ROOMS AND A LADIES' ROOM...
</b>
<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY
</b>
	THE COP, clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks
	around.  Under one stall he sees a woman's HIGH HEELS.  He
	hastily ducks back into HALL and signals an okay to Helen.
	Before the door behind her closes, we see the COP prepare to
	stand guard outside.  HELEN walks past the stall with the
	high heels to a stall several doors down.

<b>	CLOSE UP HIGH HEELS:
</b>
	And a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the
	ankles.  The shoes are kicked off.  The feet disappear from
	view as

	HELEN, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper
	around the seat before raising her skirt.  A faint noise
	makes her freeze.  Her hand reaches for the door.  She is
	just able to unlock it, but no more, before a NOISE COMES
<b>	DOWN FROM THE NEXT STALL.
</b>
	Like a lariat it falls over HELEN'S head and is violently
	yanked tight.  She kicks at the stall door.

	CORRIDOR: COP, leaning against outside door smoking, hears
	the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. He
	reacts...

<b>	INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUED
</b>
	The RED-HEADED MAN is struggling to secure the rope around a
	hook inside his own stall.  KNOCKING (o.s.)

				COP (o.s.)
		Doctor Hudson?  Are you okay in
		there?

	The MAN lets slip a little slack.

	HELEN'S fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck,
	get just enough air for HELEN to let out a strangled little
	scream.

	CORRIDOR: COP, not certain what to do about the ambiguous
	sounds from inside.  Women stands nearby, inhibiting him for
	a split second from going in the Ladies' Room door.  Now
	there is more SOUND from inside...

<b>	INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	COP steps into the room, gun down.  Over the COP'S shoulder
	we see HELEN hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering at
	her throat.  She has one slippery shoeless foot on the
	toilet seat.

	COP takes a couple of steps forward.  Behind COP'S back we
	see a broom closet door opening.

	HELEN'S POV: CLOSE UP: The COP, taken from behind.  In a
	second, his throat is slit.  In a gush of  blood, he falls,
	his gun still in his hand.

	RED-HEADED MAN standing over the fallen COP, smiling at
<b>	HELEN.
</b>
	COP'S BODY IS TWITCHING, JERKING.  The violent contractions
	in his fingers cause the gun to go off... ONE... TWO SHOTS,
	the sound reverberating against the tile walls.

<b>	STAGE AREA
</b>
	The audience and SECOND COP react to the gunshots.
	HELEN, her eyes bulging, struggling against the rope.

<b>								SLAM CUT:
</b>
<b>	INT. HELEN'S APT - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT
</b>
	As HELEN, in bed, bolts up from the nightmare, her hands try
	desperately to pull the dream rope from her neck.  She is now
	pale, her hair is dirty, there are deep circles under her
	eyes.  This is a woman in the throes of a breakdown.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Andy!  Andy!

	She races through this LOFT APARTMENT (THE WALLS ARE EIGHT
	FEET UNDER A TWELVE-FOOT CEILING) to study opening off a
	hall.  She looks in, gasping for breathing...

<b>	INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	The room is neat -- nobody there.  (We will later see that it
	is used on and off by her computer, Andy.)

	HELEN whimpers in frustration; she is alone.  SHE TALKS TO
	HERSELF as she turns back and moves past a LIVING ROOM,
	where she turns on lights and the TV flicks on, (COURT TV.)
	The sound comes up, loud... She moves on... trying to calm
	herself with the sound of her own voice...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		It is October twelfth, 1994 in the
		city of San Francisco, California,
		U.S.A., the strongest, richest,
		most stable and happiest country in
		the world.  That is the sole place
		of life in the universe.  Under
		God.

	CLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  Two pills are shaken out into a palm,
	others scattering from the nervous haste...

	CLOSE: HELEN  Watching herself in BATHROOM mirror as she
	tosses down the pills, gulps water.  She regards her haggard
	reflection with a certain detachment...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Good God.  What happened to you?

	She barks a rueful laugh... we are seeing a woman will
	herself from near-hysteria to relative calm...

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>
	HALL  As she exits the bathroom.  And moves into her OFFICE.
	She pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers.
	Of the side-by-side computer screens, one is blank.  The
	other shows a chess setup.  Flashing on the bottom of the
	screen comes a command.

<b>				CHESSMASTER
</b>		'It's almost seven.  Make a goddam
		move.'

	She studies the chess set-up for a moment, then makes a
	move.  She has not even hit the Keyboard of the other
	computer before CHESSMASTER sends another message.

<b>				CHESSMASTER
</b>		'Lousy move.  Not really into this
		game, Helen.  Let's drop it.  I've
		got a feeling about you.  Let's
		meet.  Like a date.'

	HELEN types the following to CHESSMASTER.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		'I'm a terrible date.  I'd mess up your
		life.'

<b>				CHESSMASTER
</b>		'Another romantic dream gone all to
		hell.'

<b>				HELEN
</b>		'Maybe it's better to just dream
		on; avoid the disappointments of
		life.  Come on, move.'

	She pushes a button on the remote, and we see the window
	curtains open.  BRIGHT SUNLIGHT STREAMS IN!  We see that the
	T-shirt HELEN wears says "Shrinks 'R' Us."  She crosses to
	the window with her glass of cognac, looks out.

<b>	VIEW:
</b>
	A sweeping view of the bay, and across to Marin County.  The
	morning sun is dispelling the last of the night's fog.
	HELEN opens window, puts a hand outside, trying to <u>feel</u> the
	air, the freedom.  Feeling quite restored from the dream
	horror of the night...

<b>	O.S., THE PHONE RINGS.  HELEN.  A FRISSON.
</b>
	CLOSE: PHONE  Her hand comes into FRAME and picks up the
	handset and carries CAMERA TO CLOSEUP HELEN.

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(carefully)
		Yes?
			(listens)
		You son-of-a-bitch!  Son of
		a bitch...

	Stiff with fear and rage, she slams down phone.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		You <u>filthy</u>... <u>son of a bitch</u>!

	On the computer screen behind her the Chessmaster makes his
	move: the computer speaks in its tiny computer voice:

<b>				COMPUTER
</b>			(filter)
		You Queen is in check.
		Protect your Queen.

<b>	OVER CREDITS:
</b>
	HOME MOVIE of a young woman dressed in a seat suit.  It is
	morning, and she is jogging on a park path.  Her hair is in
	a long braid.  She is sweating, breathing heavily, clearly
	near the end of a satisfactory run.

<b>	THE FILM REVERSES, THE FILM STARTS UP AGAIN IN EXTREMELY
</b><b>	SLOW MOTION.  WE ARE NOW AWARE THERE IS ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW
</b><b>	AT WORK HERE.
</b>
<b>	NOW THE FRAME FREEZES AT A POINT WHERE IT MAKES THE JOGGER'S
</b><b>	OPEN-MOUTHED DEEP BREATHING LOOK LIKE
</b>
<b>	A SCREAM!
</b>
<b>	END TITLE AND CREDITS:
</b>
<b>	INT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY
</b>
<b>	MUZZLE OF SEMI AUTOMATIC PISTOL BLASTS NINE SHOTS ALMOST
</b><b>	DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA.  A BEAT OF SILENCE...
</b>
	THE TARGET: it is a silhouette of a man's head and torso;
	centered in the right side of the upper chest, near the
	shoulder, is a small red circle.  Still SMOKING, THE HOLES
	FROM THE BULLETS are scattered all over the chest, and none
	in the circle.

<b>				M.J. (V.O.)
</b>		My third grade teacher at the
		convent shot better than that.

<b>	THE SHOOTER, RUBEN GOETZ, AND PARTNER M.J.
</b>
<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Yeah, but she had divine guidance.

	We now take in the shooter, RUBEN, and his companion M.J.
	HALLORAN.  M.J. is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking
	young woman.  She is neat, buttoned down, crisp.  M.J.
	appears to be about twenty-five.  She is, in fact,
	thirty-four and a homicide inspector with the rank of
	sergeant.  She is usually dressed in slacks and a loose
	sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear
	even smaller and younger than she is.

	RUBEN GOETZ is also in homicide, about twenty-six and junior
	in authority to M.J.  RUBEN is good-looking, good-humored
	and laid back.  He has a cellular phone attached to his
	belt.

<b>	M.J. PULLS THE LINE THAT DOLLIES THE TARGET BACK TO THEM,
</b><b>	AND RUBEN REPLACES IT WITH ANOTHER AS THEY TALK.
</b>
<b>				M.J.
</b>		I'd feel a whole <u>lot</u> safer with
		Sister Loretta for my backup.  Look
		at this guy: you shredded him!

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Well, he's dead, he can't hurt me
		now.

	The target is rigged; they pull the line that dollies it back 
	to shooting position.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		It's sloppy shooting.  It's in
		character, Ruben, but unnecessary.
		And bad for your career.

	RUBEN LETS OFF THREE QUICK SHOTS: they cluster nearer the
	circle.  M.J. looks at him in surprise.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		I've been practicing.  Now can I
		kiss your tummy?

	M.J. hides her smile as she prepares her weapon for her turn.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Perp's holding a hostage, the
		shoulder on his gun hand is gonna
		be exposed.

	SOUND: A CELLULAR PHONE (ON RUBENS' BELT).  M.J. holds her
	fire.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Answer it.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't
		you at least interested in which
		one it is?

	She's lost her concentration lowered the gun; now as he
	answers, she raises her gun and aims...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>			(into phone)
		I'm here, where are you?...
		<u>Heeeeyyy</u>!  What a surprise!  No.  On
		duty, have to call you back... You,
		too, you too.  My God, you made my
		day.

	He hits the "end" button...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		You hit the brachial nerve...

	SHE FIRES!  The shots make a perfect heart around the circle,
	inside his looser pattern.  ONE FINAL SHOT STRIKES EXACTLY
<b>	IN THE MIDDLE!
</b>
<b>				M.J.
</b>		You're good enough you'll never
		have to kill anyone.  I joined the
		cops to save lives, not waste them.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		You know, M.J., when I watch you
		shoot, I realize I've got a little
		problem with my stance... could you
		just move over here and critique my
		legs?

	He slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be.
	She is unloading her weapon...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		The problem is between your legs.
		You told your shrink about that?

	She is unloading and cleaning up.  Ruben doing the same...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		I tell my shrink about <u>you</u>,
		Sergeant.  I tell him you're the
		top cop of my dreams.

	Ruben has been gathering up his box of doughnuts, from which
	he has nibbled during the preceding... he drops them, picks
	one up off the floor and sticks it in his mouth...

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(putting away her
			 gear)
		Don't take that mess in the car.

	They're on the move; as they go away from us...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		He's in love with you already...

</b>
<b>	EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY
</b>
	They pull up in front of an apartment building in the
	Pacific Heights section.  Patrol cars flank the street, the
	thick yellow ticker tape "POLICE CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS"
	is already up.  M.J. double parks beside a blue-and-white.
	A couple of cars from the media are already there.  SUSAN
	SCHIFFER a bulldog of a woman, and her camera crew, waylay
	M.J. and Ruben as they cross the sidewalk...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Oh, Christ, the Mouth is already
		here.

	She is, with a cameraman with a haircut and smile that speak
	of a life of orthodontics and dreams of TV anchorship.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Hey.  And there's the Haircut right
		behind.  If she stops short he's
		gonna be there feet up her ass...

<b>				SUSAN
</b>			(on camera)
		Inspector, can you...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		I just got here myself, Susan.

<b>				SUSAN
</b>		...confirm this third murder adds
		up to a pattern?  Do we have a
		serial killer on the loose in the
		city?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		I just got here.  Talk to you
		later...

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(as they escape behind the
			 barrier tape)
		What the hell does she want to do,
		scare everybody to death?

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		That's her job... Jesus, Quinn is
		here already.

	QUINN, a splenetic Irishman, a politician, Chief of Homicide
	stands at the top of the steps leading to the front door.
	As they climb up toward him...

<b>				QUINN
</b>		I been waiting... I have to do
		everything myself.  Photo, crime
		tech, the Coroner are already
		inside.  The Landlady calls it in;
		tenant is not answering when
		called, she sticks her head in,
		sees the body, uses the deceased's
		telephone to call 911.  Otherwise
		nothing disturbed.  It's all yours,
		kid.  I'll take care of the Mouth
		and the Haircut.

	M.J. and Ruben enter...

<b>	INT. APARTMENT HOUSE - HALL - DAY
</b>
	Four uniformed cops stand in the hall securing the premises;
	at the back one cop stands by a stunned and tearful woman
	chain-smoking (the Landlady).

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(to cop)
		That the Landlady?
			(to Ruben)
		You wanna talk to her, Ruben?
			(back to cops)
		Who was first on the scene?

	Mike answers her question by answering to Ruben!

<b>				MIKE
</b>		I was.

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(forcefully)
		I'm over here?  What's your name,
		Officer?

<b>				MIKE
</b>		Michael Johnson.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up
		anything?  Use the doorknob?  I
		don't want to find your prints on
		anything later and you tell me you
		forgot to tell me.

<b>				MIKE
</b>		No.  I didn't.

	She glances at him, at the SLIGHTLY OLD INFLECTION ON THE "I
	DIDN'T."  But moves on, as Ruben goes to the Landlady...

<b>	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
	The same YOUNG WOMAN we saw jogging, is now dead.  Hair
	still in a long braid.  She wears only a blouse, open and
	pushed back.  She is on her back in the bathtub, with one
	leg dangling over the side of the tub.  The effect is
	slightly posed, but casual, relaxed.

	Bending over her is DOC, the Coroner, WITHDRAWING A HUGE
<b>	MEAT THERMOMETER FROM HER SIDE.
</b>
	M.J. APPEARS IN THE BACK OF THE SHOT taking in the scene.
	Foreground, Doc reads the thermometer.  The photographer is
	finishing up his shots.  The room is crowded.  Two Coroner's
	men wait in the doorway, a stretcher standing on end between
	them; M.J. has to pass between them to come down to the
	body.  THROUGHOUT WE FOCUS ON M.J.'S FACE; HER REACTION TO
<b>	THE SCENE, RATHER THAN DWELLING ON THE SCENE ITSELF.  
</b><b>	
</b><b>	ON M.J.:
</b><b>	
</b><b>				DOC (V.O.)
</b>		Liver and rigor are telling me
		about eight hours.  I'm gonna take
		her out now if it's alright.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		I'm seeing ligature marks on her
		neck here, petechial hemorrhages in
		her eyes.  Strangled.

<b>				DOC
</b>		You got it.  Same as the other two.

<b>	THE TELEPHONE RINGS.
</b>
<b>				COP (V.O.)
</b>		Tell whoever she can't come to the
		phone, she's all tied up.

	Nobody laughs...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		That's real old material, get a new
		writer...

	She picks up the phone after the second ring, holding
	it in tissue someone hands her...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Hello?

<b>				PHONE VOICE
</b>			(extremely cheerful)
		Hello!  This is Geena Martinez, how
		are you this morning?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		What is this about, Ms Martinez?

<b>				PHONE VOICE
</b>		I'm conducting a telephone survey
		to determine whether you're
		satisfied with your insurance on
		your personal valuables...

	M.J. gently hangs up the phone.  She has been looking at the
	Dead Woman... They pick up where they left off.

<b>				DOC
</b>		He used something soft, like a
		stocking or a bathrobe tie.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Anybody find it?

	No answer as the Coroner's men crowd in beside M.J. to begin
	lifting the body out of the tub.  M.J. takes one last look
	into the dead woman's eyes...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Cover her up, please.

<b>	INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
	Ruben still talking to the Landlady and taking notes.  M.J.
	approaches Mike... takes him aside...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Mike.  Why don't you tell me what's
		bothering you?

	Mike is acutely uncomfortable.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out
		and sooner is a hell of lot better
		than later.

<b>				MIKE
</b>		Well, there's something missing in
		there.  There was something around
		her neck when I came in there, but
		it's gone now.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Who came in after you?

<b>				MIKE
</b>		Lieutenant  Quinn.

	She seems relieved.  Brightly:

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Well, it's all right, then, Mike.
		Thanks.

<b>	EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY
</b>
	In the door, M.J. appears, looking out thoughtfully over the
	scene; Ruben appears behind her.  The photographer is coming
	out...

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(to Photographer)
		Get me good faces on the crowd
		here.  Get a couple of harness bulls
		to grab anybody who starts to
		run...

<b>				PHOTOGRAPHER
</b>		Don't tell your Grandmother how to
		suck eggs.  I only been doing this
		work since your junior prom,
		darling...

	But M.J. is already on to other things.

</b><b>	B.G.
</b>
	The door opens and Helen looks out, wasted from cognac and
	Xanax.  She looks for the newspaper and sees it with a look
	of despair.

<b>	HELEN'S POV
</b>
	The newspaper lies there, out of reach.

<b>	HELEN
</b>
	As she stretches out her foot toward the paper, can't reach
	it.

	POV.  As she moves out into the hall her agoraphobia
	manifests itself: DISTORTED VISION THAT MAKES THE HALL
<b>	STRETCH AND THE WALLS TAKE ON EXAGGERATED PERSPECTIVE;
</b>	SICKENING -- VERTIGO!  The newspaper seems further away.

	HELEN  She drops to her knees and tries to lean out further
	into the hall...

	POV.  The floor seems to melt and roll in waves toward her.
	The newspaper melts like a Dali watch.

	HELEN sweats.  She lies flat on her stomach and crawls toward
	the newspaper... and with a supreme effort grabs it and
	squirms back inside.

<b>	INT. APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
	As she slams the door shut on the hall, and sits gasping for
	breath.  After a moment she can bring herself to look at the
	newspaper... INSERT:

<b>	INT. QUINN'S OFFICE - DAY

	QUINN is watching a portable TV screen with profound distrust.
	Onscreen is SUSAN SCHIFFER.

<b>				SUSAN
</b>		... continues to stonewall the
		public.  Now...

	There is a knock, but before QUINN can respond, M.J. enters.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		You messed with the scene.

<b>				QUINN
</b>		Shut up.

	He and M.J. both listen to SUSAN.

<b>				SUSAN
</b>		... third Bay Area woman has been
		strangled, but the police continue
		to deny that this is the work of
		one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn
		declares that the murders will be
		treated as unrelated crimes, unless
		new evidence...

<b>	M.J. TURNS OFF THE TV, FACES QUINN...
</b>
<b>				M.J.
</b>		You messed with the evidence.

<b>				QUINN
</b>		I tagged the goddamned stocking.
		It ain't lost.  We're sequestering
		that evidence.  That's the trap some
		son of a bitch is going to fall
		into...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Am I in charge of this thing?  Or
		not.

<b>				QUINN
</b>		I said you were...

<b>				NH
</b>		Then I decided what evidence we
		choose to sequester.

<b>				QUINN
</b>			(a beat here)
		Okay.  What do you want to
		sequester?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		The stocking around the neck.

	A long moment of looking at each other.  Then...

<b>				QUINN
</b>		You didn't say serial killer and I
		didn't say serial killer.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Right.

<b>				QUINN
</b>			(not satisfied she
			 really means it)
		This is the anniversary of the
		summer of love and your city
		fathers have declared a Festival of
		Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of
		Commerce don't want TV announcing
		killers on the loose.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Right.

	And she starts to go...

<b>				QUINN
</b>		We're gonna have a bunch of clapped
		out old hippies blissing on the

<b>	INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY
</b>
	This large room is very busy, many officers at work.  Known
	sexual offenders have been rounded up.  False confessors add
	to the crowd.  Detectives who are not dealing with these
	people are making and taking calls.  At this desk, a tall
	intense looking Detective, NICCOLETTI, interrogates a false
	confessor, a man who looks like a businessman...

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		Harvey, I don't want you in here no
		more, making false statements...

<b>				CONFESSOR
</b>		They are not false.  We pay for
		city government like this, you
		don't even care about the truth?!
		I killed her in the bathtub.

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		Why?

<b>				CONFESSOR
</b>		Because she was dirty, a dirty
		girl!

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		How?  How did you do it, Harvey?

<b>				HARVEY
</b>		With a knife?

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		Good guess, but not good enough.
		Get the fuck outta here...

	He has stood as M.J. passes coming from Quinn's office.  He
	falls into stride with her through the crowded scene... He
	is sweaty and sniffs his armpits as a matter of general
	hygiene checkup...

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		What am I wasting my time with this
		shit for?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Because it's your job, that's all.

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(cutting)
		Maybe it's something you did in
		this life, Nikko...

	It has the flavor of a spoiled intimacy, an unfinished
	argument... He pantomimes she got him with a poison dart.

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		Got me.  That really hurt!  You...

	Ruben joins them; Nikko stifles and turns away...

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(to Ruben)
		Get Mercer to run the medical,
		dental, legal bills, laundry and
		dry cleaning receipts, extermin-
		ators, mailmen, grocery and
		drugstore deliveries, handymen,
		plumbers...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		It's mostly done, they got nobody
		in common, the three of them... No
		mutual friends -- the Landlady says
		nobody was ever there, she never
		saw her with anybody.

	They are approaching PACHULSKI'S desk.  PACHULSKI is on
	phone.  Pachulski is looking at M.J., grinning...

<b>				PACHULSKI
</b>			(into phone)
		Yes, ma'am, I know.  You can't talk
		her right now... because she's 
		busy, she's all tied up.
			(sotto to M.J.)
		Deep Throat's back.

	He hits the speaker phone...

<b>				FEMALE PHONE VOICE
</b>		This is the third one.  You've got
		a serial killer here.  When are you
		going to start <u>warning</u> people?

<b>				PACHULSKI
</b>			(whispering)
		Fourteen calls from this broad.
		And she ain't stupid.

	M.J. signals for GIGI to trace the call.  Takes the phone,
	switches off the speaker...

</b>		Who is this?

<b>	INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
	HELEN on phone

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Who is this?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm
		in charge here.

<b>				PACHULSKI
</b>			(amused)
		Ask her about the moon bike.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		I'm really interested in your
		ideas.  The moon bike.  What <u>is</u>
		that?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		What is wrong with you people?
		The first two, I thought he might
		be on a lunar cycle because they
		were 28 days apart, but obviously
		not.  This new one is only two
		weeks.

	Pachulski is delighted at the joke he's played on M.J., M.J.
	not so much... Gigi signals they're getting it.

				HELEN (cont'd)
		You want to joke about moonbikes?!

<b>				M.J.
</b>		No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And
		neither is tying up telephone lines
		to police with crank calls while
		people in trouble are trying to get
		through for help.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		You're calling me a crank?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Do you have any evidence to report,
		ma'am?  Do you know any of the
		victims...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I think this is number three...

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(over her)
		That's an opinion, not evidence...

	Gigi hands her a slip of paper... M.J. reads it... glares
	at Pachulski who is still laughing.  M.J. knows the name on
	the slip of paper...

<b>	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
	HELEN, now wearing slippers and shorts with the same T-shirts
	she slept in, is standing behind the living room curtains
	looking down at the street.  She hears a code knock, then a
	key turns in the lock.  She moves to greet ANDY her
	assistant and friend.  ANDY is laden down with groceries and
	mail.  HELEN immediately reaches a hand up to touch his
	face...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Where were you?  Don't tell me.
		It's just under seventy, right?  The
		sun is strong but the air is dry
		and fresh...

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Would you please get your hands off
		my face, Tallulah?  What happened
		to the newspaper?

	He withdraws a popsicle from the bag, offers it to her.
	When she rejects it, he takes it for himself.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I got it myself... I couldn't wait.

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Well!  Aren't we the daring one?
		What's morbid and ghastly enough in
		the news to make Doctor Helen set
		foot outside her door?  The antenna
		is gone off her car again.  I had
		no music, all the way to the
		market.  Let me find a garage for
		it?

	They're in the kitchen area; Andy unpacking stuff...
	expensive goodies...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I've told you:  I can't afford to
		garage it.

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Are you kidding?  You buy enough
		gourmet junk every week... most of
		which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of
		stretch limos.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I had the dream again.
			(beat)
		And I got another call.  This time
		he spoke.  He said "You and me, you
		and me."

<b>				ANDY
</b>		A little heavy breathing is what
		most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I
		know it was him!

	Andy now stops to address this seriously...

<b>				ANDY
</b>		He can't phone you unless the
		warden gets an okay from you.  Did
		you give him an approval?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Andy?  When a three-year-old says
		there's a monster under the bed,
		you don't say 'forget it'.  You
		look under the bad.
			(beat)
		I'm three years old.  Call the
		prison.

	Her fear is so palpable, she is so nakedly vulnerable it
	breaks his heart.  He puts his arms around her.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Oh God.  I'm really crazy.

<b>				ANDY
</b>		When was the last time you washed
		your hair?

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(shaky, but trying)
		Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my
		coiffure?

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your
		coiffure.  And guess what else?

	He pats her thighs... she walks to the window as he talks...

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Cellulite.  What do you say I
		blindfold you and take you to the
		gym.  Aerobics with housewives...

<b>	HELEN AT WINDOW
</b>
<b>				HELEN
</b>		Andy?

	Andy has heard this tone before:  panic attack alert.

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Here we go again.

<b>	ANGLE AT WINDOW TO INCLUDE THEIR POV OF STREET
</b>
	In a parked car a man is reading a newspaper that hides his
	face.  Behind him is parked a slightly beat up red Saab.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		You parked right behind him.  The
		one I noticed earlier.  I didn't
		say anything, I thought he'd leave.
		Just take a look.

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A
<b>		NEWSPAPER!
</b>
<b>				HELEN
</b>		But earlier, he was staring up
		here.  <u>Please</u>, Andy.

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry'
		coming up.

	ANDY leaves the apartment.

<b>	EXT. FRONT DOOR OF HELEN'S BUILDING - DAY

	The heavy old industrial door is pushed slightly open, ANDY
	peers out, sees:

	ANDY crosses behind the car and then sneaks back, coming
	up to Driver's side window, surprising the Driver.
<b>	THE NEWSPAPER DROPS:  IT'S RUBEN.
</b>
<b>				ANDY
</b>		Excuse me, but would you mind
		explaining why you're watching the
		lady upstairs?

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		None of your fucking business.

	Usurping RUBEN'S aggressive attitude, ANDY leans his face
	close to RUBEN'S window.

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Listen, asshole, I've got a gun...

	RUBEN grabs ANDY by the collar and yanks his head inside the
	car.  With the other hand he pulls his gun and pushes it up
	ANDY'S nose.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		I hate this...

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Only kidding!

	RUBEN pushes the 'up' button on the window, capturing ANDY'S
	head in a deadlock.  Then he opens the door, gets out, slams
	door, forcing the squawking ANDY into a helpless frisk
	position.  We HEAR HELEN scream, (O.S.).  Ignoring this,
	RUBEN begins to frisk ANDY.

<b>	M.J. APPROACHING IN HER OWN CAR, SEES THE ACTION, BRAKES

	Andy enters, followed by Ruben and M.J., who holds up her

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I
		apologize for Goetz, he's a

<b>				ANDY
</b>			(trying to defuse)
		I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed

	Uncomfortable silence for a beat as they try to take in
	what's happening, who's who and what's what.  Helen is
	confused, fighting back fear...

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(trying to communicate

		Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor
		impulse control.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Is he out?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Who?

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(to Andy)
		If he's not out, why are they here?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Because of your phone calls.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		What calls?  I haven't made any
		calls.

<b>				ANDY
</b>			(to distract)
		Are you staying long?  Shall I shut
		the door?  Make your coffee?  Make
		the beds?

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(to Helen)
		You talked to me.  Do you remember?

	The two women measure each other, Helen struggling to
	control herself.  A beat.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		You were the one that talked about
		moonbikes and called me a crank?
		Oh God, I <u>am</u>!
			(to Andy)
		Make them some coffee.
			(to M.J.)
		Halloran, is it?  Investigator
		Goetz?  I had a crank call myself--
		he said...
			(a moment of real
			 fear)
		I thought it might be Daryll Lee
		Cullum.  I thought he might be out
		of prison.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think
		so.  If he's escaped we'd have the
		National Guard, cops'd be crawling
		through sewers.  You'd have a guard
		on your front door.

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(looking around)
		I want to tell you it's a great
		honor to meet you and talk to you.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		You don't admire me.  No police
		admire me.  I got one of you
		killed.  Why don't you say right
		out what you're here for?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control.
		The accounts of the firs two
		murders made it so clear they were
		the work of the same man, but you
		kept announcing they were
		unrelated.  You'll never catch him
		that way.

	M.J. regards her for a moment...

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(to Andy)
		Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take
		mine black.
			(beat)
		You're absolutely correct.  The
		politicians don't want panic
		headlines spoiling the Festival of
		Love.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Well, let's thank God you and
		Inspector Goetz are on the case,
		then.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Would you want to work with us on
		this?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical
		hysteric, with panic syndrome, and
		anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm
		afraid of everything, real and
		imaginary.  I never leave this
		apartment now.  Nobody ever comes
		here.  I just wanted to get your
		attention.  I write and I used to
		lecture on these crimes, but... I'm
		not competent.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		I think you are.  I really admire
		everything you've done; it would be
		an honor to work with you, and we
		need all the help we can get,
		especially yours.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Inspector Halloran, that is so much
		bullshit, you don't like or admire
		me, but the beautiful part is I
		don't give a fuck.  That's the
		upside of having a breakdown.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Well, it's a hell of an apartment
		you got here.  I'm living one step
		away from the projects, myself, but
		I get to go to work every day,
		wading in blood and guts.  I guess
		the books you wrote about these
		sons of bitches paid off pretty
		good.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Will you go.  Andy, make them go.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		You can't go out lecturing?  Tough
		shit.  Women are dying.  Where can
		I lay this stuff out?

	She dumps files of photos, etc., out on Helen's cocktail
	table.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I don't want this.  What are they?

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		You called us, Doctor, if you don't
		want to look at them here, how
		about downtown.  I'll drive you
		down...

	She pushes the pictures off onto the floor, tries to get up
	to leave the room.  M.J. and Ruben are both appalled at the
	force of what is happening: an all-out panic attack...

	fights him off viciously, gasping for air... Andy races
	back in with a PLASTIC BAG HE PULLS OVER HELEN'S HEAD AND
	FACE...  She hyperventilates into the bag...

	THE PLASTIC BAG BALLOONS OUT AND BACK IN HELEN'S FACE until
	she faints.  Andy deals with it like an everyday event,
	treating her very gently...

<b>				ANDY
</b>			(to Ruben)
		Now look what you did.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		What did I do?

<b>				ANDY
</b>		You threatened to drive her
		downtown.  She has agoraphobia.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Fear of what...

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Open space.  She hasn't been out of
		this apartment in three years.  I
		didn't used to think it was real...

	He's making her comfortable.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		We'll get the paramedics...

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Oh, God, uniforms, more stress.
		Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting:
		she hyperventilates till she passes
		out, then her breathing goes back
		to normal, and she wakes up singing
		like a lark.
			(rocking the
			 unconscious Helen)
		We know, don't we, Princess?
			(to them)
		Give her a couple of hours.  I know
		about this.

	M.J. starts to gather up the pictures and files.  She is
	angry and disgusted.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Tell her we're sorry we bothered
		her.

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you
		really want her help.  I mean if
		you really do, leave them.  Let her
		see them.  I'll see they're safe...

	M.J. takes in the scene; the now soundly sleeping Helen;
	Andy sitting over her protectively, the files and photos
	strewn around.  Makes a decision...

<b>	CLOSE: AN ATTORNEY IN COURT
</b>
<b>				ATTORNEY
</b>		... it was your feeling after
		careful evaluation that he was a
		sexual sadist who satisfied at
		least four out of ten criteria in
		the DMS III?

	SHOW M.J. and Ruben watching videotapes, and eating Chinese
	takeout.  HELEN is being interrogated by the ATTORNEY for
	Daryll Lee Cullum.  Helen sure of herself to the point of
	arrogance, which is her undoing...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Yes.  Without question.

<b>				ATTORNEY
</b>		Without question?  He only scored
		40 percent, four out of ten
		criteria?  Couldn't another expert
		say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist
		test?  What curve are you marking
		on, Doctor?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		The test criteria are only part of
		what we look at in evaluating
		subjects.

<b>				ATTORNEY
</b>		Only part.  What else?  What did
		you think of his claim that he tied
		this girl to the tree and set fire
		to her because Joan of Arc told him
		to do it.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		He was lying.

<b>				ATTORNEY
</b>		'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked
		you what you thought, not what he
		did.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I thought he was lying.

<b>				ATTORNEY
</b>		You said, first, he was lying.  How
		do you know that, Doctor?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Because people who are suffering
		from aural hallucinations hear
		voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee
		told me that Joan of Arc always
		appeared beside him on his left
		side and spoke softly in his left
		ear.

	Murmur of subdued laughter in court.

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(emboldened)
		He took pains to hide his actions
		because he knew they were morally
		wrong.  He was not acting on mad
		impulse.  He was sane and acting
		out a pattern he carefully followed
		every time.

<b>				ATTORNEY
</b>			(playing causal)
		What pattern was that?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		The same as the first time...

	She catches herself.  The D.A. has leapt to his feet, but now
	tries to sit down as though nothing was happening, but
	Helen, the Attorney and the D.A. all are clearly disturbed
	by the line this questioning is taking.

<b>				ATTORNEY
</b>		The first what?
			(as she hesitates)
		Your Honor, she's got this far, I
		think she should finish.  I don't
		think this jury should be left
		wondering where the rest of her
		statement would lead.

<b>				JUDGE
</b>		I agree, Doctor.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		The first two murders.

<b>				ATTORNEY
</b>		What first two murders.  We don't
		know about them here, do we?

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(giving up)
		He told me he had done two others
		just like it.

<b>				ATTORNEY
</b>		When was that?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		When he was seventeen.

<b>				ATTORNEY
</b>		And you believed him when he told
		you he had done that.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Yes.  I believed him.

	The D.A. is rushing to the bench to argue with the Judge.

<b>				JUDGE (V.O.)
</b>		Yes, I'll accept a call for a
		mistrial.  Evidence of that other
		crime when the defendant was a
		juvenile is inadmissible and never
		should have been heard by this
		jury...

		Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		What clues?  I'm going to work

</b>		How about I put Nikko on it?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		That's always your privilege, sir.

	QUINN snorts, starts on his way, then turns back.

<b>				QUINN
</b>		Sergeant?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Yessir.

<b>				QUINN
</b>		You ever reflect how this big
		explosion in dead women coincides
		with the flowering of women's lib?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Yessir.  I have reflected on that,

</b>		When are you going to call them?

		About what?

	ANDY PRODUCES THE FILE M.J. LEFT WITH HIM.  Helen looks at

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I can't, Andy.

<b>				ANDY
</b>		Then, why don't you just die.  I'm

</b>
<b>				HELEN (V.O.)
</b>		The way he's posed the bodies...
		he's flaunting his power to do
		whatever he wants to her.  This
		man... He probably seems perfectly
		normal.  These murders are organized
		and planned.

<b>	WE ARE NOW SEEING THE ROOM:  M.J. AND RUBEN, HELEN AT A TABLE
</b>	IN HER OFFICE LAYING OUT THE PICTURES.  Helen picks out one
	picture from the rest...

</b>		Except for this one.  You put that
		one in to test me.

	M.J. nods, pleased with HELEN&gt;

	INSERT: THE PICTURE.  The victim's body is covered with
	bruises.  But, unlike the others, her face has been covered.

<b>				HELEN (V.O.)
</b>		Is it an ongoing case?

<b>	BACK TO SCENE...
</b>
<b>				M.J.
</b>			(nods)
		For months... last October.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		It was a lover or a husband.
		Someone close.  Somebody who knew
		her and cared about her.

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(glancing at Ruben)
		How do you know that?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		He felt remorse.  He covered her.

	HELEN arranges and rearranges photos like tarot cards.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		The bodies have been carefully
		arranged... different positions,
		but somehow the same.  The
		positions are brutal... yet
		quite... artful.  It's like... a
		signature.  He's proud of his
		accomplishments.  There are early
		Picassos and late Picassos, but you
		always recognize the hand.  He
		wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand.
		I've seen this hand before... what
		are you hiding?

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(taken aback)
		Nothing.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Where are the stockings he
		strangled them with?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		How did you know they were
		stockings?

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(sarcastic)
		I sent Andy out on murder missions.
		For God's sake -- it's the Boston
		Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used
		their own stockings to strangle
		them.  Tied in a bow-knot.

	She gets down a file from her bookcase and flops it open to
	pictures of deSalvo's victims:  they are identical...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Somebody is imitating his m.o.
		Look for a plumber or carpenter or
		handyman; that's how deSalvo got in
		the door and caught them off guard.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		The Boston Strangler, when was
		that...?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		In the sixties.  He's dead --
		stabbed to death in prison.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Why imitate a dead serial killer?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		If you knew why, you might know
		where to look for him.
		I don't envy you this; he's not
		done -- he's going to do them faster
		and faster to keep the adrenaline
		rush.  Now, I've done what you 
		asked me.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Work with me.

<b>				ANDY (O.S.)
</b>		It's good for you.

	They are startled by his appearance!  A little unsettling.

<b>				ANDY
</b>		It's good medicine.

</b>		A little homeopathic cure for the
		willies.

</b>			(exhausted)
		None of you know anything about it.
		Now go.  And Andy, if you persist
		in playing doctor, leave, with
		them.

<b>				QUINN
</b>		He's on the phone calling me like an

		business, for Christ's sake.  I
		didn't tell him the three most
		over-rated things in life are young
		pussy, regular exercise and the
<b>		F.B.I.
</b>
<b>				M.J.
</b>		Oh, maaaaan?!

<b>				QUINN
</b>		What?  I talk like a cop, this is
		the way I talk.  I can't believe
		this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy
		Assistant Director of the F.B.I.
		"Let me help you!"

<b>				M.J.
</b>		We could use a little help.

<b>				QUINN
</b>		With the F.B.I. there's no such
		thing as a little help.  They bury
		you with help.  Explain to me about
		this virus, no don't tell me about
		the virus.  Thing is, you saw it,
		the pictures.

	They pass through a door into a ROOM where the homicide team
	sit waiting... M.J. goes right into a briefing...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		We saw it.  The unknown target is
		kneeling, she's gardening.  Red
		hair, high cheekbones, mid-
		thirties, height I don't know,

	The husband's voice follows QUINN and others as another COP

	M.J.'S POV: On the bed, the RED-HEADED WOMAN'S body is
	propped up against the headboard, her knees up, her head
	fallen onto a shoulder: her pajama top has been ripped open
	and pushed up.  Knotted around her neck is a pink scarf tied
	in a huge bow under her chin.  On her feet, secured between
	her toes, is a commercial flyer advertising the Festival of
	Love.  It is brightly printed with red hearts.  It has been
	hand-lettered:

	The CAMERA records the unsteady progress of a lovely YOUNG

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Tell her about <u>what</u>?

<b>				ANDY
</b>			(mock admiration)
		Gaahhd!  What a <u>cop</u>!  You busted

			(real)
		The new one, in the Marina.
			(to their reaction)
		She has a police radio scanner.
		It's always on.  She turns it off,
		and then she has to turn it on
		again.  She's obsessed.  She can't
		not listen to it, but she can't
		listen to it, so she makes me
		listen to it.

<b>	HELEN APPEARS IN WHATEVER SHE SLEEPS IN.
</b>
<b>				HELEN
</b>		I am not going to look at any more
		pictures.  They're like a disease.
		They get into my head.  I can't get
		them out.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		I don't look at pictures.  I look
		at the <u>real thing</u>.  I don't feel
		infected.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Maybe that's why you can't catch
		him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like --
		the red-headed woman in my
		computer.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		I just came from her... here's what
		you haven't seen.

	M.J. takes out a picture of the dead RED-HEADED WOMAN.  Her
	manner is that of cop with a witness.

				M.J. (cont'd)
		A forgery of the Mary Sullivan
		murder scene, he's done it perfect.
		Except for the sign.

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(looking at photo)
		She probably let him in the door
		without a thought.  Where are their
		mothers?!  Where are the mothers
		that are supposed to teach them to
		be wary and to tough and not afraid
		to fight?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the
		Festival of Love?  You make any
		sense in that?

	HELEN stares at the picture.

				M.J. (cont'd)
		For 'Hell', read 'Helen'.  He's
		talking to you.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author-
		ity.  They write, they even knock
		on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It
		thrills them to flirt with getting
		caught.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Nobody knows you have anything to
		do with this case; nothing has been
		on TV or the news... Why would he
		want to get in <u>your</u> computer?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Because I'm his damned pin-up girl!
		His, all of them!  They know me.
		They're in prisons with libraries,
		they collect clippings, I'm their
		worthy opponent.  You keep my name
		out of this.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Absolutely.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		My promise.

	Andy, who has ducked out, now reappears, dressed for a date.

<b>				ANDY
</b>		The moon is up, my night to howl.
		Will you be okay?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You
		go.  Poor thing, you ought to get
		out.

<b>				ANDY
</b>			(to M.J.)
		Look out for her.  She's tougher
		than you think.

	He goes...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest
		of it?

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		MaryJane.  We call her M.J.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		MaryJane.  You think that logic and
		police procedure, order and science
		and method will hold back the
		horrors of a world gone mad and the
		sickness of the night.  I did once.
		But you know how he'll get caught?
		He'll have an accident, or some cop
		will get lucky.  You can't catch
		him by being intelligent and
		working hard.  Or the worst:  there
		are dozens of women slaughtered in
		the most horrible way, month after
		month.  The news stories grow more
		grotesque and bizarre and in the
		city people lock their doors and
		windows, and hurry home before
		dark.  And then, one day, there are
		no more.  What happened?  Did he
		just stop?  Get tired and disgusted
		and decide not to kill any more?
		Did he kill himself?  Did he die in
		an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or
		get sick and die?  It's like the
		murderer walked off the edge of the
		earth.  And you never know.  But
		you keep asking yourself -- when you
		read about a new murder -- is he
		back?

	M.J. stands.  She has noted Ruben's reaction to Helen's
	story.  There is an edge of sarcasm in her voice...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		That's amazing.  A whole new book,
		thought up in a minute.  Very good.
			(beat)
		All I know how t do is get up,
		take a shower, and go to work.
		Hope, if he does another I'll nail
		the son of bitch, and they'll spell
		my name right in the newspaper.
		Where is Andy going?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		He's going home.  He slept over
		because I was a little anxious...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		I want a guard on you.  I'm worried
		about leaving you alone.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>			(to M.J.)
		We're through for the night, aren't
		we?  You go on.  Get some sleep.
		I'll stay until we can get a man
		out here and maybe catch a cab
		home.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		That would be much appreciated.
		Thanks.

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(to Helen)
		Somewhere down the line we're doing
		to find a connection between him
		and you.  I want you to worry that
		idea like a loose tooth.

	momentarily on the sidewalk to look up at Helen's window...
	The drapes swing open.  RUBEN CAN BE SEEN DOING SOMETHING AT
	THE WINDOWS... The Camcorder zooms to a close-up of M.J.
	She gets into her car and speeds off.

<b>	INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Ruben is checking the windows...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		You ought to get some decent locks
		on these.  A six-year-old could get
		in here.  Much less a motivated
		man.

	At the phrase 'motivated man', HELEN looks at him boldly in the
	eye.
<b>  				HELEN
</b>		You and MaryJane aren't lovers.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Not yet.

	HELEN laughs.  So does RUBEN.  Her boldness, her <u>laughter</u>,
	attracts him.  His honesty attracts HELEN.  He feels the
	heat.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Are you always so bold?

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.

	His grin says he'd select her anytime...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		The problem for me is... you're in
		the witness category.
			(beat -- Jack
			 Nicholson)
		Know what I mean?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Well.  Another time, then.
			(beat)
		I'll be all right.  He's not going
		to attack me; what I' m rally
		afraid of is all in my own head,
		Ruben.

	They smile ruefully at one another, and without further
	conversation, leave the bedroom.

<b>							CUT TO:

<b>	INT. HELEN'S FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
</b>
	RUBEN is outside the door.  HELEN just inside.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		They'll have a guard here tomorrow.
		I know you have the idea, but it'll
		make me feel a lot better.

	She smiles, and RUBEN turns, walks away.  She stays in the
	doorway watching his retreat.  About ten feet away, he
	suddenly stops.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Hey!

	He turns around, she is still in the doorway.  He reaches
	for his wallet, withdraws a card, holds it up to her.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		The number for my cellular.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Don't hesitate.  <u>Anytime</u>.  Night or
		day.  I mean that.

	He hods card out to her.  HELEN, holding onto the door
	frame, doesn't move.  RUBEN continues to extend his hand
	with the card in it.  It is a charged moment.  She is frozen
	in the doorway; RUBEN refuses to make a move towards her.
	HELEN summons all her nerve and lets go of the door frame,
	determined not to have any further mortification this night,
	she takes one shaky step out into the hallway to meet him.
	Then a second step and a third.

	Her hand touches the card, takes it.

	She turns her head to gauge the distance she must retreat.
	What she sees is that the door's Sureclose device has
	quietly and efficiently closed.  The door is locked.
	Frantic, she turns back toward RUBEN.

<b>	HER POV:
</b>
	RUBEN, now seems a vast distance away from her.  He is just
	turning down the stairs and is gone... The hallway first
	narrows, squeezing her in, then expands.  She is lost in the
	miles and miles of space between the two walls.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Oh, God!  Help me!

	RUBEN reappears, races toward her...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Tell me what to do!

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!

	She starts to pass out, to sink to her knees, but RUBEN
	catches her, puts her up against the wall, handling her like
	a suspect.  He puts one hand on the back of her neck,
	spreads her legs, gets her in frisk position.  Somehow, this
	is comforting to her, but she is still in full-blown
	panic...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		...falling... FALLING!

	He pressed his body up against hers, his weight anchoring
	her against the feeling of free-fall.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		I'm right here.  I won't let you
		fall.

	He still has a hand on the back of her neck.  Suddenly, the
	proximity effects him, makes him want to kiss her neck.  She
	begins to hyperventilate.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Don't let go... I can't breathe...
		I'll die!

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe.
		I'll fix it...

	RUBEN takes out his gun...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Put your hands over your ears.

	RUBEN shoots off the lock.  Then he picks HELEN up and
	carries her back into her apartment.

<b>	INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	RUBEN enters and puts HELEN down on the couch, pulls a throw
	up over her.  He sees her Xanax bottle on a table, hands it
	to her.  She takes out three as he pours her some seltzer
	water, then watches her take the pills.  After which he
	takes the bottle and pockets it.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		The lock...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		I'll get a locksmith.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid
		to sleep... I don't want...<u>him</u>...in
		my head...

	RUBEN pulls a big chair up beside the sofa.  As her eyes
	close, RUBEN comforts her.  TV features the antics of a
	nervous little prairie dog family.  He looks back at HELEN.

<b>	CLOSE UP HELEN:

	We hear a faint but impatient voice call:

</b>		Peter... Peter...

<b>							CROSS FADE TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. BEDROOM (DALY CITY) - NIGHT
</b>
	Dim light.  The room is unattractive, over-furnished but not
	comfortably.  A WOMAN is sitting propped up in a double bed.
	She is in her mid-thirties, but drained and pale, she looks
	older.  A chronic invalid.  By her side is a NASTY LITTLE
	DOG, with ribbon bows in its fur.  Near the bed is a TV and
	video, on which a movie's final credits are running.

<b>	THE WOMAN IS IMPATIENTLY PUSHING AN INTERCOM BUTTON
</b>
	PETER enters.  Younger than the woman, rather good-looking.
	Boyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near
	his hairline.  AN OLD SCAR.  He goes straight to TV and puts
	the tape on 'eject.'

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		Put in the Kevin Costner.

<b>				PETER
</b>		Why don't we save it for later?
		It's almost time for Letterman.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		You know I don't like to watch talk
		shows by myself.  Where're you?

	He inserts the video she wants and pushes 'play.'  Then he
	approaches the bed, leans over his wife and gently pushes a
	lock of hair back from the forehead.

	She ignores him, staring at the screen.  The NASTY LITTLE
<b>	DOG BARES ITS TEETH AND SNAPS AT HIM.
</b>
<b>				WOMAN
</b>		See, now you've annoyed her.  You
		know she doesn't like you to touch
		me.
			(to dog)
		Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve
		you so much!
			(to Peter)
		Did you feed her?

<b>				PETER
</b>		Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's
		hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed
		her?

<b>				PETER
</b>		She lies all the time.  Why would I
		say I fed her if I didn't?

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		That's what I don't know.  Why
		would you lie?  That's the
		problem... I can't understand why
		anyone would lie.

	He leaves.  As he goes we can hear the Woman still talking
	to her dog over the TV soundtrack.

				WOMAN (cont'd)
		You wouldn't lie to Mummy, would
		you?  Just to get Dad in trouble?
		Such a naughty widdle dog...

	HER VOICE FADES AWAY AS WE FOLLOW HIM down the stairs into a
	small, ill-lit and dreary living room, into a messy kitchen,
	then through a door leading to the basement.  He locks the
	basement door behind him.

	THE BASEMENT is brightly lighted, full of high tech, gadgets
	and computers.  As he approaches the bottom stair, we see a
	small TV/video set attached to a wall.  On its screen,
	freeze-framed and silent, is a video of a PRETTY GIRL at an
	outdoor rock concert, smiling seductively.

	PETER puts on a WHITE LAB COAT and then reaches over
	something to turn the video back on.

	The CAMERA PANS DOWN to what he has leaned across.  It is
	the YOUNG GIRL from the concert.  She is strapped onto a
	table, her mouth taped shut.  A plastic bag covers her head,
	but not tightly.  She is semiconscious.  She is being
	asphyxiated by slow degrees.

	PETER looks at her, gently pushes the bag up far enough to
	repeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made
	toward his wife.  He whispers:

<b>				PETER
</b>		Didn't I promise I'd come right
		back?

	ALL NIGHT FESTIVAL REVELLERS dance across the skyline, of
	glorious misty green hills, hand in hand.  The Camera moves
	down, across verdant meadows, until we arrive at the bottom
	of the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway.  A
	few festival up-all-night REVELERS, looking down at a new
	CRIME SCENE, where three blue-and-whites are parked, plus a
	number of unmarked cars.

<b>	RUBEN ARRIVES IN A TAXI.

	As he moves past the ever-present SUSAN we THREAD THROUGH
	THE SCENE TO FIND M.J.  M.J. takes one look at RUBEN'S
	stubble, his yesterday's slept-in clothes, and she turns
	away.  Before RUBEN can catch up with her, NIKKO approaches.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Up all night with a sick friend.

	NIKKO'S face is tight with anger.

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		You dumb son of a bitch!  You don't
		even know how to treat a woman.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Who?  M.J.?  Hey, Nikko, explain to
		me why she gave you the boot...

	He moves to M.J. who stands beside the dead BODY OF THE
	WOMAN WE LAST SAW STRAPPED TO A TABLE.  The plastic bag is
	now tied tight around her neck.  She has been posed beneath
	a sign that says "NO DUMPING".  The usual technicians,
	photographers, Doc, the Coroner, etc.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(angry about it)
		Quinn decided we should form a task
		force -- they're all one case, now.
		He wants all the senior detectives
		on it...
			(to Doc)
		She wasn't killed here.

<b>				DOC
</b>		Not likely.

	M.J. is kneeling, inspecting everything here; Ruben kneels
	beside her... to Ruben...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Tell me what you see.

	He inspects the dead girl's fingernails.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		She didn't fight back, no hair or
		skin under her fingernails.  I'm
		not seeing any bruises or
		contusions...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		What about her arms?

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at
		this...

	Nikko appears, looming over her...

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		Probably so stoned she never knew
		what got her.  Like Goetz's sick
		friend.  Right Goetz?

	They ignore him.  M.J. stands...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		She's blue as hell.  No marks on her
		neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same --
		no ligature marks.  Outdoors...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Look at her legs.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Spread out like she was sexually
		assaulted here.

<b>				DOC
</b>		After she was dead.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		She was dragged up here from the
		road, you can see the tracks.  She
		was already dead or unconscious.
		Let's get plaster casts on any --
		all footprints.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		If this is just the dump site,
		where did he do the job?  Where did
		he pick her up?

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		Doped up kids all over town.  Park
		was full of them last night.  Very
		easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.

	Ruben hits him, Nikko reflexively throws a punch that grazes
	Ruben.  Everybody stops in astonishment.  M.J. steps between
	them.  Ready to get physical herself; they settle...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		What the hell are you doing?  The
		Mouth and the Haircut are right
		down there, thank God they didn't
		see that.

	Down below, Susan and the Haircut are interviewing Festival-
	of-Lovers.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Niccoletti, they're on the wrong
		side of the tape, you want to push
		them back?  Now.

	Nikko trots off to Susan and the Haircut.  M.J. gestures for
	RUBEN, now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip, to follow
	her back to the cars.  As they move more slowly down the
	hillside to their cars...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Ruben, my God, I ought to put you
		on report.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		You're right.  I can't stand that
		bastard.  Sorry.
			(getting back to
			 work)
		This is something new.  Not the
		same guy, that's for sure.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Yeah, everything's different.

	But she seems unhappy... to techs standing by:

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Get the pictures, and casts of
		footprints.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Look at him, grandstanding...

	Nikko is talking to Susan Schiff...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		<u>That's</u> all we need...

	She strides toward them...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Detective Niccoletti?

<b>				SUSAN
</b>		What's this about the Boston
		Strangler, M.J.?

	M.J. looks at Nikko.  He should know better.  She's also
	thinking: is this a good thing to have the media announce at
	this point -- or not?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Hey, Susan -- I'm sorry, you're on
		the wrong side of the tape.  We're
		still trying to find any footprints
		or tire marks and we don't want to
		chew up the ground, okay?  I'll
		talk to you later.
			(to Nikko)
		You, too.

	She's got Susan outside the tape...

<b>				SUSAN
</b>		Inspector, will you confirm
		somebody is copying the Boston
		Strangler?  This is the fourth, is
		that correct?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		We're going to review all the
		evidence carefully before making
		any statement...

	She is getting into her car; Ruben jumps in on the other
	side.  Susan races for her silver Audi...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Ruben, put the light on...

	From outside the car as they drive away we see Ruben's arm
	clap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car.

	M.J. switches it on... A CHASE ENSUES.  SUSAN has a faster
	car, but M.J. is a better driver.  Stomach dropping hills,
	trolley cars, the corkscrew turns of Lombard Street, all the
	familiar San Francisco chase scenes.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Now listen up, Ruben.  You never,
		never, never mess with somebody
		<u>inside</u> the case!

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do
		you...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		You damn well better start working
		on that impulse control.  A woman
		who is implicated in this case?
		Someone who's practically a piece
		of <u>evidence</u>?

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		It's against your rules that I try
		to help a witness who's scared
		shitless?  Who's...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		The woman's unstable.  You could
		wind up with a harassment charge.
		<u>Anything</u>.  You're like some horny
		little teenager.

	M.J. takes another two-wheel corner.  In the rear view
	mirror, M.J. watches SUSAN lose control of her car as she
	tries to make a tight turn, M.J. smiles in contempt.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Anybody who's ever watched TV knows
		about that corner.

	Having lost SUSAN, M.J. slows down to a normal speed.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Everybody could see you -- unshaved,
		same clothes from yesterday,
		reeking of sex.

	RUBEN'S eye-brows lift.  She peels into the HQ parking lot
	and jumps out.

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(going away)
		Park the car.  Call the lab.  Get
		Doc to lean on the coroner for a
		really fast prelim on the sperm.

	RUBEN gets out of the car to cross to the driver's side...

<b>				M.J. (O.S.)
</b>		When you get it, call me.

	RUBEN look after her, a smile of delight on his face.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		She loves me.

<b>				QUINN
</b>		She left you, Nikko.  She's not

		your business.  Your business is to

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		We were together six years, sir!

<b>				QUINN
</b>		Don't give me six years!  You never

		you expect from M.J.?

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		She knows I'm Catholic!  She never

		Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare

		But of course, I'm Irish.

		Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm

</b>		It's not the same guy.  It should be

</b>		But it's a different m.o.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Then what do you need me for?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		She was killed somewhere else and

		Where it says "no dumping."  Her

		Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's

<b>				HELEN
</b>		You're saying it's the same man,
		but he's changed his style?  That
		doesn't happen.  These men are

		of the pleasure...

	They've turned into the office.  Something is wrong...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Who turned off the Internet

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I turned it off.  It's like an open

<b>				HELEN
</b>		She was near a sign that said "No

		the lab said one was a secretor and
		the other was not?

	M.J. mumbles a surprised yes.  Helen is at computer.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		There were needle marks.  But no
		drugs in her blood.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		So far nothing they test for comes

	Helen has a Window type screen: she clicks icons...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		He's switched from DeSalvo to the
		Hillside Strangler.  The Strangler
		was two men, that's why there are
		two kinds of sperm.  His idea of a
		joke, very witty our boy.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		That's not consistent... You said
		they never changed their style,
		they're robots...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Consistency is the hobgoblin of
		<u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test
		for the chemicals found in Windex.
		That's a product for cleaning
		with...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		I know Windex, for God's sake, I
		clean my own windows...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		It's what Bianchi and Buono
		injected into one of their victims.

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(sensing something
			 appalling)
		Injected Windex!  Why would he
		switch to a new m.o.?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half
		way to nailing him.  Serial killing
		is irrational and rigid and 
		compulsive.  This guy has a plan
		all thought out, flexible and
		complex.  He's playing a game with
		us.  Who will he imitate next?
		Maybe he's doing all the serial
		killers in history, the great
		innovators, the murderers' hall of
		fame.  Just to prove he's better
		than all of them.  They got caught;
		he didn't.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		He'll get caught.  If he has a plan
		that'll be what trips him up...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Who's going to catch him?  You?
			(beat)
		And if you do, there'll be another

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(gently, surprised)
		You're afraid of him.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		This one, yes.  I was always

	appears near the corner of the left eye of the Red-headed

</b>
<b>	CLOSE, THE MAN: HIS FACE TURNS TO THE LIGHT: FROM THIS HIGH
</b><b>	ANGLE WE AND WE SEE DOWN INTO THE STREET, WHERE
</b>
	RUBEN'S CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP.  RUBEN charges into the
	building.

	BURT, COMING AWAKE, FOLLOWS RUBEN up the stairs three at a
	time.

<b>	HALLWAY AND APARTMENT DOOR:  THE MAN COMES RACING OUT AND
</b><b>	TURNS TOWARD THE STAIRS, JUST AS RUBEN REACHES HELEN'S
</b><b>	FLOOR.  THE MAN TRIES TO DO A 180, BUT RUBEN THROWS A BODY
</b><b>	BLOCK AND THE MAN FALLS BACK INSIDE THE APARTMENT.
</b>
<b>	LIGHT FROM HALL GIVES US OUR FIRST LOOK AS RUBEN TEARS THE
</b>	BALACLAVA OFF HIS FACE.  He is a middle-aged Afro-Asian with
	a knife-scarred face.

<b>				MAN
</b>		I can explain!

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		The fuck you can!
			(shouts)
		Helen!  Are you okay?  HELEN!

	Then he sees her.  In shock, she stares down at the MAN.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Did this animal touch you?

	She shakes her head, turns and runs out of the room, as
	RUBEN catches sight of BURT.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Turn on a light and call in the
		unit.  <u>NOW</u>!

	BURT rushes to okay.  RUBEN FRISKS THE MAN.

<b>				MAN
</b>		No gun!

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Bullshit's gonna get your balls
		stomped on!  What's your name?

<b>				MAN
</b>		Chow.  Conrad Chow.

	The improbability of this name makes RUBEN deliver an angry
	kick to the man's side.

<b>				MAN
</b>		Swear to God!  <u>Conrad Chow</u>.  Never
		carry a gun.

<b>				BURT
</b>		Backup's here...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>			(to Burt)
		Then you get your ass outta here, I
		don't wanta see you again...

<b>				CONRAD
</b>		I brought a present for the lady,
		there.  I'm looking for her, to give
		her the present...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		You break into her apartment to
		deliver a gift?  Where is it?

<b>				CONRAD
</b>		The door was open, swear to God,
		I'm just looking for her when you
		come charging up the stairs...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Where is it?

<b>				CONRAD
</b>		I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the
		lady's pillow...

	Ruben shoves Conrad into Backup Cop's hands.

<b>	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Ruben comes running in, sees a parcel lying on pillow... 
	scoops it up, and rips it open.  It's a book.  He returns
	to Conrad, who is now surrounded by police.  Ruben holds the
	book up like a question.

<b>				CONRAD
</b>		Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that
		book, he wanted the lady to have
		it.  They won't let him send it to
		her, so I'm getting out, he asks me
		to deliver it in person, he says,
		put it on her pillow.  It has all
		about how he tried to kill her.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		He told you she was loaded, any-
		thing you could steal you could
		keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself
		a return ticket to Quentin,
		breaking and entering.

<b>				CONRAD
</b>		The door was already open...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		We know...

		Send the book to evidence...

</b>		She's supposed to have it.

</b>		She don't want it.

<b>	INT. HELEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	HELEN is sitting on the floor, her knees pulled up to her
	chest.

<b>				RUBEN (V.O.)
</b>		Helen?  Open the door.  The guy's
		nothing.  A burglar.

	She sits there, says nothing.

<b>				RUBEN (V.O.)
</b>		Open the door.  Please.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Why don't you shoot off the lock?

	She starts to laugh.  The sound is awful.  After a moment,
	she gets up on wobbly legs and opens the door.  RUBEN takes
	her to the sink, sort of sits her down on it.  Wets a
	washcloth, goes to sponge off her face.  She is trembling.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		He was in my apartment!

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		I know, baby.  I know.

	Without warning, in some sort of manic phase of a freak-out,
	she breaks away from him, ricochets through bedroom, down
	the hallway, RUBEN follows, tries to put his arms around
	her.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		It's okay... you're safe with me!

	He pulls her down into a chair with him, his arms tight
	around her, holding her still.  He smoothes her hair, rubs
	her neck, pets her like a frightened and resistant cat.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		When I was a little kid, and I'd be
		in a state, my father would hold me
		on his lap, until all the fight
		would go out of me...

	She breaks free and whacks him across his nose.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		You think you're my Daddy?

	There is something so perverse about this, so erotic, that
	RUBEN kisses her.  She goes limp, kisses him back, then
	she's suddenly sobbing.  His nose is bleeding, but she's
	smiling.  Something between them has finally connected.
	Been agreed upon.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Helen...honey, you know I gotta go.

	He digs out his sneaky gun from whenever he keeps it.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		You know how to use this?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		They taught me at the FBI.  I was
		very good at it.  It scared me... I
		liked it.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		You take it, hang on to it, it'll
		make you feel safer.  Stay put.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		What else?

	He goes.

<b>	A SONG BEGINS, PRELAPPING THE FOLLOWING SCENES:  "MURDER BY

</b>
		"Once that you've decided on a killing
		First you make a stone of your heart
		And if you find that your hands are still willing
		You can turn murder into an art..."

<b>	HELEN OPENS THE WEAPON, SEEMINGLY COMPETENT ENOUGH TO HANDLE
</b><b>	IT WELL, AND EMPTIES OUT THE BULLETS.  SHE LOCKS IT UP AND
</b><b>	HEAVES A SIGH OF RELIEF.

<b>	EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
</b>
	THE FBI ARRIVES.  High angle, looking down: three identical
	cars draw in front, park with military precision: all four
	doors on the all three cars open at the same time and
	identically dressed men, in suits, get out, slam the doors
	in sync., and march toward the front steps to HQ, ignoring a
	couple of bemused cops smoking on the sidewalk...

<b>	INT. POLICE HQ - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	As the parade of FBI, led by their Commander SAKS, walk down
	the corridor from the front door, toward CAMERA, performing
	a smart right angle turn, and (CAMERA PANNING TO FOLLOW)
	continue away from CAMERA down another corridor.  Through
	the glass partitions and in the halls they pass cops who
	pretend they aren't looking at them: no eye contact between
	cops and FBI.  The cops are at ease; bellies slop over
	belts; neatly pressed blouses strain over breasts; sweat
	stains; shirtsleeves.  The marching men wouldn't sweat.

	QUINN emerges from his office and sees them arriving.  He
	gets his jacket off a hook on the back of the door, signals
	a few top officers to follow.  He looks resigned...

<b>	INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (LATER)
</b>
	M.J., RUBEN, NIKKO, and a number of other officers are being
	addressed by SAKS, an FBI agent.  At the back are three more
	FBI AGENTS, suited and tied.  QUINN stands off to one side.
<b>	THE SONG IS JUST ENDING, ON A CD PLAYER IN THE ROOM.  A
</b>	projector beams up a copy of the note RUBEN found in the
	phone booth.

		Dr. Hudson:  Don't lose your head.
		"Once that you've decided on a killing
		First you make a stone of your heart
		And if you find that your hands are still willing
		You can turn murder into an art.
		Well, if you have a taste for this experience
		You're flushed with your very first success
		Then you must try a twosome or a threesome
		Before your conscience bothers you much less.
		Then you can join the ranks of the illustrious
		In history's great dark hall of fame
		All of our greatest killers were industrious
		At least the ones that we all know by name."

	SAKS speaks...

<b>				SAKS
</b>		Hello.  I am (research title)
		Meryhew Saks.  The song is called
		"Murder By Numbers."  The
		performers are a group called The
		Police.  Adam here...
                ... from Behavioral Science is
		working out exactly what this
		perpetrator is trying to telegraph
		in the note.  This is an extremely
		complex case, and we have a lot of
		fancy theories floating around.
		We're not ruling out the possib-
		ility of three Copycat serial
		killers.  We have Quantico working
		on graphology, the Washington lap
		is cloning DNA from the secretor.
		It's our feeling that the best lead
		we have is the two sperm samples in
		one of the victims.  We have a team
		sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want
		to say a few word to you local
		people.  Your Commissioner asked
		for our assistance.  The Bureau
		does not send us in on these cases
		to lord it over the local police.
		We couldn't catch up on what you
		people know if we had a year.  We
		have nation-wide resources and hard
		state of the art forensic science;
		you have the local savvy.  Together
		we can be unbeatable.  Which one is
		Inspector Halloran?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Over here.

	SAKS approaches M.J., guides her away from the others.
	TWO SHOT:  Saks is unctuous and insincere, self-confident.

<b>				SAKS
</b>		We don't see too many lady homicide
		detectives.  You have <u>my</u> respect.
		Have you discussed the note with
		Dr. Hudson?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Someone broke into her place last
		night.  It wasn't connected to our
		case, but it shook her up pretty
		bad so I haven't...

	QUINN joins them, SAKS gives him a nod.

<b>				SAKS
</b>		I was just about to advise the
		Inspector here not to show Dr.
		Hudson the note.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a
		pattern develop...

<b>				SAKS
</b>			(riding over her)
		We know Helen.  She's not exactly a
		credible collaborator.  Especially
		late in the day...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		She takes tranquilizers her doctor
		prescribes.

<b>				SAKS
</b>		Who prescribes the brandy?

	M.J.'S look makes SAKS smile.  QUINN is called to the phone.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		How come you're so up on Dr.
		Hudson?

<b>				SAKS
</b>		She is a writer, writing best
		selling books about serial killing.
		Giving lectures she's well-paid
		for.  Her interests are not the
		interests of law enforcement.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Okay.

<b>				SAKS
</b>		We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's
		phone.  I know you won't mention
		it.

	So much for any trusting relationship, right?  QUINN has
	arrived, addresses SAKS.

<b>				QUINN
</b>		Sorry to interrupt.  I need a word
		with my officer...

	He turns to M.J.  Diplomatically, SAKS moves away.

<b>				QUINN
</b>		M.J., I'm going to have to borrow
		Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing
		in Chinatown is going down tomorrow
		night and Jack's kid got hit by a
		car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		What does this mean?  Now we got
		the FBI, my team is expendable?
		I'm working my ass off, is anybody
		listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He
		and Nikko don't even get on
		together...

<b>				QUINN
</b>		Teach both of them a lesson in
		cooperation and self-discipline.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		If this is a first step in kicking
		me off the case, just tell me, to
		my face, sir, don't waste time
		being diplomatic.

<b>				QUINN
</b>		Just, I need results.  And -- I am
		short-handed.  Who else am I gonna
		give him?

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(looking at Saks)
		Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a
		bitch.

	She turns and leaves, brushing past Saks as she goes... Gigi
	meets her...

<b>				GIGI
</b>		Lab called.  They got a result on
		the drug test you requested...?

	It takes a moment to remember what it was...

<b>				GIGI
</b>		They said it was Windex?

	If there was any residual doubt about what's happening, it's
	gone now.  She starts after Quinn, sees he is in spirited
	dialogue with SAKS and decides to wait.

	HELEN and M.J.  Helen unfolds a xerox copy of the note, that
	M.J. has just given her.

</b>		..."I'll be back..."

	As she looks at the back of the note... she looks up into
	M.J.'S face.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Yeah.  Addressed to you.  "Don't
		lose your head."

	Helen puts down the note.  She is holding herself together
	by main will power... doesn't want to face that note...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!

<b>				M.J.
</b>		He said to send you his regards and 
		to tell you that the Bureau holds
		you in the highest esteem.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		What I can't believe is that in an
		earlier life I slept with him!
		Christ!  Any God that loved his
		people would give women a rewind on
		their life and an erase button.
			(looks at M.J.)
		Just give me a minute here.  The
		letter is addressed to me...
			(she's breathing
			 fast, controls it)
		You don't feel fear, do you?
		You're young.  You feel like you'll
		live forever.  How wonderful.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		I put my ass on the line, giving
		you that.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		They weren't going to show it to
		me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!

<b>				M.J.
</b>		It's also the major piece of
		evidence, and it makes you a key
		part of his plan.  You can't run
		away from it anymore.
			(beat)
		Look at the order he's doing
	them... He did three as the Boston
		Strangler just to tell us a copycat
		serial killer was at work.  Then he
		did one like the Hillside Strang-
		ler.  And then one as Son of Sam.
		To lead us on -- to where and what
		end?  And he's doing more than that
		-- he's imitating each killer's
		method as closely as he can -- in
		details.  Injecting Windex.  Using
		.44.  Playing Abba.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		It's not chronological: Son of Sam
		was before Hillside.

	She begins to read.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		It's clear he thinks he knows me.
		He lives a fantasy.  'Helen, don't
		lose your head.'  Is that a threat?
		Does he want to cut off my head?
		Dahmer cut off heads.  Who else?
		Kemper.  Did Gacy?  Rivkind?  I
		think Rivkind did.

	She puts the note down on the table, smoothes it out.  She
	closes her eyes for a moment.  We begin to see certain
	filtered images.  As they come, we INTERCUT them.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		He attacks what he feels he can't
		have.  What he feels excluded
		from...

<b>	EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

	Lush, pastoral green.  We see PETER sitting by himself.  He
	wears a WHITE LAB COAT, like one we saw hanging in his
	basement.

	HIS POV:  of students on the green, playing Frisbee,
	studying together, picnicking.  Women sunbathe, their straps
	pulled down on their shoulders, their tops rolled up to
	expose their midriffs.

<b>				HELEN (V.O.)
</b>		'First you make a stone of your
		heart.'... Oh yes!  <u>He</u> doesn't
		suffer.  That's past.  Now it's our
		turn.

	One of the sunbathing girls sits up and looks round, then
	takes her top off entirely.

<b>				HELEN (V.O.)
</b>		Kemper said in order to have the
		experience he wanted with them, he
		needed to evict them from their
		bodies.  By making the body a
		completely passive object, he
		releases <u>himself</u> from passivity.

<b>	CLOSE:  HELEN, DEEP IN THOUGHT...
</b>
<b>				HELEN
</b>		But the relief he feels is only
		temporary.  '...Before your
		conscience bothers you much
		less...'  But the tension always
		comes back.
			(she now picks out
			 the words:)
		'You can join the ranks of the
		illustrious...'  He wants to be

	The SMALL BOY is flung into an under-stairs closet where

<b>				HELEN (V.O.)

		control him, that he's the one in
		control.  But the feeling of power
		never lasts.  He can control his

	PETER pulls his nondescript sedan up to them and says

	outside world HE IS MANIC...

<b>				DARYLL LEE
</b>		Hey, Doc!  How you doing?

	She turns on speakerphone.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Hello, Daryll Lee.

<b>				DARYLL
</b>		You read my book which as you know,
		hit the stands a couple of weeks
		ago.  You read it yet.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		What book?

<b>				DARYLL
</b>			(indignant)
		I sent it by private courier, he
		didn't give it to you?  That son of
		a gun...!

	Helen looks at M.J., who indicates 'tell you later.'

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.

<b>				DARYLL
</b>		Bet you never figured I'd follow in
		your footsteps.  It's real well-
		written.  You should read it --
		you're in it.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and
		talk to you about it after I've
		read it.  Right now I have a
		question... Peter Kurten.

<b>				DARYLL
</b>		Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I
		told that son I'd send him what he
		wanted if he leave you alone.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Ah ha.  What did he want?

<b>				DARYLL
</b>		Something personal.  Is he bothering
		you?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I don't know.  I'd like to know
		where he is.

<b>				DARYLL
</b>		Listen, you want my advice?  Steer
		clear.  He's writing me he's gonna
		finish 'my unfinished symphony.'
		He's gonna give me $550 for some of
		my cum, he says he's in a position
		to see that I will be immortal if
		he has some of my spunk.  I'm
		offended.  Right away I smell
		<u>freak</u>.  Writin' about him and me
		and <u>you</u> bein' joined and he's gonna
		finish my <u>symphony</u>?  I didn't care
		for his drift.  I sent some liquid
		soap in a sandwich baggie with a
		message from Jesus to mend his
		ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And
		what's funny is, now I don't mind
		bein' inside.  If I was out, even
		Born Again, I'd probably get
		restless again.  It's maybe better
		I stay here, what do you think?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I think whatever is best for you,
		Daryll.  And maybe you're right,
		that's the place.

<b>				DARYLL
</b>		You come and visit.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Where did you send the message to
		Peter Kurten?

<b>				DARYLL
</b>		Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too!
		That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to
		Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in
		return for getting my book to you.

	At this mention of Conrad, M.J. leaps to another phone...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		How was Conrad supposed to find
		Kurten?

<b>				DARYLL
</b>		Conrad has the phone number.
		Conrad, where is he?

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(from M.J.'s pantomime)
		In jail.

<b>				DARYLL
</b>		That Klutz.  They send him back
		here, I'll kick his ass good.

<b>				DARYLL LEE
</b>		Helen, how is life, you okay?  Come
		see me, talk to me.  I think about
		you, worry about you all the time.
		I am so glad Jesus didn't let me
		kill you.  You know -- you're
		blessed by Jesus.  That's why you
		need to come talk to me, because
		Jesus kept you alive for a reason,
		and I was his sacred instrument...
		In the moment Satan was in my heart
		raising my hand to kill you, Jesus
		took my hand to spare you.  I am
		both death and life to you...

	Helen hangs up.  M.J. has already left...

<b>	INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Pandemonium: the Chinatown raid has been carried off and
	NIKKO AND RUBEN and a dozen other cops are booking a group
	of Chinese gangsters of all ages, and a group of frightened
	and confused Chinese illegal aliens.  TOTAL UPROAR.

<b>	THROUGH IT, WE MOVE WITH M.J.  SHE PASSES RUBEN WHO IS
</b><b>	GRABBING A CHINESE KID STRUNG OUT ON SOMETHING, OUT OF A
</b><b>	LINE OF SUSPECTS... HE ASIDES:
</b>
<b>				M.J.
</b>		I brought back a gin-seng popper
		for you.  Guaranteed all-night
		orgasms.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Save it for Helen.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>			(enough already!)
		Wait a minute, wait a goddamn
		minute...

	He manhandles the KID INTO DOCILITY WHILE...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		The woman was in shock.  She was
		totally out on ranks.  I stayed
		because I didn't want her to wake
		up alone in a place where she'd
		just been under attack.
			(to the Kid who is
			 restless)
		Stop that, you son of a bitch!
			(back to her)
		The place wasn't secure.  I was
		doing my goddamn job!  And, for the
		<u>second time</u>, I slept in her living
		room.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't
		have the face for it.  I need you
		to help interrogate the burglar in
		Hudson's place...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Talk to Nikko...!

<b>	SHE MOVES ON TO FIND NIKKO
</b>
	NIKKO sites at his desk, processing the papers for the sullen
	YOUNG THUG who is handcuffed to a chain next to NIKKO'S
	desk.  Nikko  unholsters his gun... he shoves it into his
	desk drawer...

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		You speak English?
			(Chinese)
		You need an interpreter?

	QUINN, walking past the ILLEGALS, speaks to GIGI.

<b>				QUINN
</b>		I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted
		just the bastards dumping them in
		the harbor.  What's keeping those
		bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in
		here...

<b>	M.J. STANDS OVER NIKKO
</b>
<b>				M.J.
</b>		I gotta have Ruben, and a...

<b>	HARROWING SCREAM!!!  ILLEGAL WOMAN IS SCREAMING --
</b><b>	PANDEMONIUM AMONG THE DETAINEES.  COPS RUSH TO CONTROL THE
</b><b>	PROBLEM.
</b>
<b>				NIKKO
</b>		Outta your mind?  Look at this...

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(to Quinn)
		Lieutenant...?

	Just at that moment the kid Ruben was booking goes totally
	bananas; M.J. goes to his assistance, wrestling this wild
	kid.

	NIKKO starts from his chair, looking for the key to the
	drawer, but is isn't there... he goes to help Ruben get the
	kid under control.  Quinn steps in...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		The prowler in Hudson's apartment
		turns out to have a meeting with a
		suspect...

<b>				QUINN
</b>			(amazed)
		You got a suspect...

<b>	THEY MOVE BACK TO NIKKO'S DESK.
</b>
<b>				QUINN
</b>		How'd you get in on the deal?

<b>				M.J.
</b>		I'm gonna drop charges on the
		break-and-enter at Hudson's...

<b>				QUINN
</b>		You have no authority to make a
		deal like that.  That' s for the
<b>		D.A...
</b>
<b>				M.J.
</b>		Or the F.B.I.?

<b>				QUINN
</b>		Saks.  If he knew you did that!
		They're all asking me, 'what is she
		doing,' as it is.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		Give me Ruben back...

<b>				QUINN
</b>		Nikko?

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		We get through this shit, let 'em
		<u>all</u> go.

	NIKKO has stood and moved the handcuffed THUG toward the
	door to jail cells.  M.J. checks her time, (WALL CLOCKS HELP
<b>	US HERE:  8:47)
</b>
<b>				M.J.
</b>		I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll
		be in the jail when you wind this
		up...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		I gotta get something to eat, I
		haven't eaten all day.

	M.J. goes... RUBEN can't find a desk to work at, and
	commandeers Nikko's.  He slams the KID into NIKKO'S chair
	and cuffs him.  KID starts to rattle his chairs, spew
	Chinese epithets, then bends over the desk and, with his
	teeth picks up some paper, tries to shake it to shreds.

	RUBEN yanks the papers out of the KID'S mouth, pulls the
	KID'S chair from the side to the front of the desk, shoves
	the KID into place facing away from the desk, so that he
	can't do any more damage.  Then RUBEN can't figure out where
	he can work.  At the next desk, where he has been working,
	MAC rises.

<b>				MAC
</b>		Here... I'm finished...

<b>				RUBEN
</b>			(to Kid)
		I'm going to the coffee machine.
		Hold the fort.

	He moves off, the KID'S eyes move calculatingly around the
	room.  He twists against the cuffs, trying anything to get
	free, and discovers he can pull out the desk drawer.

	CLOSE UP:  The KID'S FREE HAND rifling through the drawer
	behind his back, finding the gun.  PULL BACK to show the
	KID.  He is as Ruben positioned him, his back pressed
	against the desk.

	She slaps him hard!  He is shocked.

</b>		You don't listen very good.  This

</b>		You get me out first.

	She's walking to the door... Conrad holds out just one more

	knob...

<b>				CONRAD
</b>		Tell me what you want me to say.
		Anything.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		You were going to make a delivery
		to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee
		Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone

<b>				CONRAD
</b>		I don't have it...

	M.J. starts to open the door...

<b>				CONRAD
</b>		Wait... wait... I already called
		him, I threw it away.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		You already made the delivery?

<b>				CONRAD
</b>		No, that's still in my jacket I was
		wearing.  We were supposed to meet
		on the docks, that number 47 wharf,
		10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand

<b>				M.J.
</b>		What Friday?

<b>				CONRAD
</b>		What day is this?  In jail you lose

	M.J. is already on her way...

	RUBEN takes coffee and doughnuts out of a box, then leans
	over the KID who seems to have calmed down.  He uncuffs him
	from the chair.

<b>				RUBEN
</b>		Behave.  You refuse my hospitality,
		I'm putting you to bed.

	He pushes the coffee toward the Kid, who WHIPS NIKKO'S GUN
	OUT FROM UNDER THE DESK, where it was hidden, and lays it up
	under Ruben's ear.  KID moves behind RUBEN and puts a skinny
	arm around RUBEN'S neck, pulling him upright.  RUBEN still
	clutching the doughnut box.  It takes a moment for the
	others to SEE.  Then the room is absolutely motionless.

<b>				NIKKO
</b>		Take it easy, Kid.  Nobody's gonna

	COMING ALMOST AT A RUN -- SHE SEES what is happening.

	The KID doesn't see her, yet, as he is backing away from the

</b><b>	REASSURANCE BRACES HERSELF WITH A HAND ON THE WALL.
</b>
<b>	THE HALLWAY (HER POV).  IT SEEMS MILES LONG.  SOUND: HER
</b><b>	FRONT DOOR CLICKING SHUT -- THE SAME ESSENTIAL EVENT AS SO
</b><b>	LONG AGO WHEN RUBEN HAD TO SHOOT OFF THE DOOR LOCK...
</b>
<b>	HELEN LOOKS BACK AT THE DOOR.  BRIDGES BURNED.  TURNS BACK.
</b>
<b>	HER HAND ON WALL: AS SHE MOVES A TENTATIVE STEP HER HAND
</b><b>	PRESSES HEAVILY, SLIDING ALONG THE WALL.  THEN HER HAND
</b><b>	MOVES A LITTLE FASTER, AND FASTER.
</b>
<b>	HER POV.  THE HALL SEEMS MORE NORMAL.  MOVING SHOT PICKS UP
</b><b>	SPEED...
</b>
<b>	HER HAND NOW BRUSHES THE WALL WITH ONLY FINGERTIPS.
</b>
<b>	HELEN MOVES WITH MORE AND MORE CONFIDENCE: HER AGORAPHOBIA
</b><b>	IS GONE... HER HAND DROPS TO HER SIDE...
</b>
<b>	EXT. HER BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
	The door opens and Helen appears in it.  She confronts the
	street and the night... One more threshold to cross...

<b>	STREET: HER OLD SAAB IS PARKED.  THE ANTENNA IS GONE, AND
</b>	IT'S COVERED WITH CITY GRIME.  The night seems to roar; the
	lights blur and flare.  A truck comes past too fast, 
	stirring up dust and buffeting her with wind.

	HELEN steeling herself and running the few steps to her car.

	INT. CAR as she slides into the driver's seat, slamming the
	door and locking it.  She drives off into the night.

<b>	EXT. MULUSKEY AUDITORIUM -  NIGHT
</b>
	A broad view through shadowy trees shows it's lighted
	facade.  Parked in front of is M.J.'s car.  SUDDENLY FROM
<b>	BEHIND THE TREES, SAKS STEPS OUT IN FRONT, BLOCKING THE WAY!
</b>
<b>	REVERSE:  HELEN'S CAR IS COMING UP THE STREET TOWARDS US.
</b><b>	SAKS (AND NOW WE SEE OTHER SWAT TYPES IN THE SHADOWS, HIDDEN
</b><b>	FROM THE VIEW OF THE AUDITORIUM) STANDS IN THE STREET
</b><b>	FLAGGING HER DOWN --
</b>
<b>	SHE STOPS, PUTTING DOWN WINDOW.  SAKS RESTS HIS HAND ON THE
</b>	DOOR... He shoves no sign of recognizing her...

<b>				SAKS
</b>		Ma'am, please get out of your
		vehicle...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Merry, how... oh, Christ, of
		course, you had my phone tapped.

<b>				SAKS
</b>		Just get out of your vehicle...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		He's got Sergeant Halloran in
		there.  He'll kill her the minute
		he sees or hears your people...

<b>				SAKS
</b>		You've been very useful, Doctor, we
		appreciate all you've done, and now
		the professional will take over...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		He wants me, he doesn't care about
		her.  Let me...

<b>	SAKS HAS THE DOOR OPEN AND IS REACHING TO PULL HER FROM THE
</b><b>	DRIVER'S SEAT... HELEN SUCKS IN HER BREATH AND JAMS ON THE
</b><b>	GAS.  SAKS IS ALMOST DRAGGED AWAY WITH HER, SPUN AROUND AND
</b><b>	FALLING ON THE PAVEMENT.  SHE SLAMS THE DOOR AS SHE SPEEDS
</b><b>	TOWARD THE AUDITORIUM...
</b>
<b>	SAKS, CURSING, LEAPS TO HIS FEET; A SWAT TYPE AIMS HIS GUN
</b><b>	AFTER HELEN, BUT SAKS PUTS HIS HAND ON THE WEAPON STOPPING
</b><b>	HIM FROM SHOOTING.
</b>
	NEW ANGLE: Helen's Saab speeds out of the tree shadowed
	street into the bright plaza in front of the auditorium, and
	brakes behind M.J.'s car.

	CLOSE: HELEN.  Sudden silence when she kills the car engine.
	She gets out of the car.  As she walks even her sneakers
	make an echo from the silent stone facade... She walks up
	the wide stairs...

<b>	INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</b>
	The huge doors creak open and Helen enters.  She stands,
	listening: light streams in from the exterior through tall
	windows, otherwise it's all back shadows, weird enough
	without the distorted vision, the vertigo that momentarily
	returns...

	Helen wills herself to move into the deep space before her.
	She stands listening: we HEAR the creaks and tiny snaps of a
	building cooling in the night air.  Or is the movement of
	Peter somewhere in the room?

	She whirls to face a distance sound that echoes in the
	auditorium...

	CLOSE: HELEN staring, trying to SEE.  NOTHING.

<b>	THEN:
</b>
<b>	PETER IS STARING BACK.  HIS FACE BECOMES DARYLL LEE.  THE
</b><b>	VISION SNAPS.
</b>
<b>	HELEN: SHE TURNS AND WALKS PAST THE ROSTRUM OF THE STAGE TO
</b><b>	A DOOR UPSTAGE LEFT... OPENING INTO A LONG AND DARK
</b><b>	CORRIDOR.  SHE GROPES FOR LIGHT SWITCHES, CAN'T FIND OUT ANY.
</b><b>	THE CORRIDOR LEADS TO THE LADIES' ROOM ON THE RIGHT.  AS SHE
</b><b>	WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY, IT BEGINS TO RESEMBLE TO HER THE
</b><b>	SAME WALK SHE TOOK AT THE BEGINNING: AND SUDDENLY AT THE
</b><b>	DOOR TO THE LADIES' ROOM SHE SEEMS TO SEE THE FAT COP.  SHE
</b><b>	SHAKES HER HEAD AND THE VISION IS GONE.
</b>
<b>	REPLACED BY INT. LADIES' ROOM.  THE COP IS NOW HELD FROM
</b><b>	BEHIND BY DARYLL LEE - SMILING AT HELEN.  IN REVERSE, WE SEE
</b><b>	FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HELEN HAS THE ROPE WELL AWAY FROM
</b><b>	HER NECK.  WE REALIZE SHE HAS AMPLE TIME TO WARN THE COP,
</b><b>	BUT SHE IS PARALYZED, FASCINATED BY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
</b><b>	TERRIBLE <i>SLOW MOTION</i> INTERCUTS BETWEEN DARYLL LEE GRINNING
</b><b>	AT HER, HELEN'S HELPLESS HORROR, THE COP'S APPEALING LOOK TO
</b><b>	HER AND BACK TO DARYLL LEE AS (BELOW THE FRAME) HE SLITS THE
</b><b>	COP'S THROAT AND LETS HIM FALL TO THE FLOOR.
</b>
<b>	HELEN (FLASHBACK) AT LAST BEGINS TO SCREAM!
</b>
<b>	CLOSE: HELEN (PRESENT) RECOVERING.  (SHE HASN'T SCREAMED AT
</b><b>	ALL.)  SHE PULLS RUBEN'S GUN FROM HER POCKET AND SHOVES OPEN
</b><b>	THE DOOR INTO THE LADIES' ROOM.
</b>
<b>	AS THE DOOR OPENS.  THE LIGHTS ARE ON: IT IS BRILLIANT,
</b><b>	BLINDING IN HERE.  SHE STEPS IN.  THERE IS A SOUND THAT
</b><b>	DRAWS HER ROUND, HER GUN COMING UP: BACK OF THE DOOR IS THE
</b><b>	BROOM CLOSET... SHE FIRES TWO ROUNDS INTO THE CLOSET DOOR.
</b><b>	IT SPRINGS OPEN AND MOPS AND PAILS FALL THUNDEROUSLY OUT
</b><b>	ONTO THE TILE FLOOR.
</b>
<b>	SHE WHIRLS TO COVER HER BACK; FACES THE STALLS.
</b>
<b>	EXT. SAKS' ROADBLOCK - NIGHT
</b>
<b>	THEY REACT TO ECHOES OF THE GUNFIRE.
</b>
<b>				SWAT
</b>		Oh, man?!  Let us in there.

<b>				SAKS
</b>		Go.  Go.  Go!

	Men begin moving cautiously out of the trees and shadows
	toward the Auditorium...

<b>	INT. LADIES' ROOM
</b>
<b>	HELEN MOVES ALONG THE STALLS PUSHING DOORS OPEN.  UNTIL SHE
</b><b>	SHOVES ONE OPEN AND SEES:
</b>
<b>	M.J. IS HANGING BY A NOOSE, DANGLING THE SAME WAY HELEN DID
</b><b>	IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE.  SHE IS ALIVE, HOLDING THE NOOSE
</b><b>	FROM HER NECK BY ONE HAND...
</b>
<b>	HELEN STARTS TO RUSH TO HER ASSISTANCE, WHEN THE LIGHTS GO
</b><b>	OUT.  PETER TAKES HER FROM BEHIND, SWIFTLY DISARMING HER,
</b><b>	REGARDING THE GUN WITH AMAZEMENT.
</b>
<b>				PETER
</b>		You cheated!  You said you'd come
		die with me.

<b>	WITHOUT PAUSE HE PUMPS TWO BULLETS INTO M.J. WHERE SHE
</b><b>	HANGS.  HER BODY JUMPS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE BULLETS, HER
</b><b>	HEAD FLIES BACK AND SHE SLUMPS, THE NOOSE TIGHTENS; THE DOOR
</b><b>	OF THE STALL SWINGS SLOWLY SHUT, AS PETER TURNS ON HELEN,
</b><b>	WHERE SHE LIES ON THE FLOOR, HORROR-STRUCK.
</b>
<b>	EXT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</b>
<b>	WITH EFFICIENCY AND CAUTION FBI SWAT TYPES MOVE TOWARD THE
</b><b>	AUDITORIUM.  A GRAPPLING HOOK IS THROWN HIGH OVER THE ROOF;
</b><b>	THEY PREPARE FOR AN ASSAULT.  A HELICOPTER SWOOPS IN, BATHING
</b><b>	THE SCENE IN ITS BRILLIANT LIGHT...
</b>
<b>	INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - NIGHT
</b>
<b>	PETER HAS HELEN ON THE STAGE WHERE CHAIRS ARE RANDOMLY
</b><b>	SCATTERED AND PUSHED HER TO A SEAT FACING HIM, ALMOST KNEE
</b><b>	TO KNEE... HELEN WILL USE HER PSYCHOLOGICAL WILES TO TRY TO
</b><b>	TAKE AWAY PETER'S CONTROL OF THE SITUATION... PETER LOOKS UP
</b><b>	AT THE SOUND... HE IS PROUD AND THRILLED.
</b>
<b>				PETER
</b>		Listen to them!  We'll be on all
		three channels.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Kill me, Peter, do it, now.

<b>				PETER
</b>		No.  Not yet.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Do it.  If that's what all this
		carnage is about, then do it.  Have
		enough guts to do it.

<b>				PETER
</b>		Don't talk to me about courage.  I
		know death, what it's like to kill.
		You're not a killer -- you watched
		Daryll Lee kill that cop and you
		didn't make a peep, because you
		were paralyzed with fear.  You
		chocked.  I know something <u>else</u> about
		you.

	Peter is jerking about with amphetamine energy; he pops a
	pill into his mouth and swallows...

<b>				PETER
</b>		You want one?  No?  There was
		something in you that was
		fascinated, that wanted to see what
	it was like for a man to die.
		Everybody feels it.  Like every
		person who slows to see a bad
		accident, or runs to see a fire.
		That's true.  I see it in you...
		you're the same as me.

<b>	THERE IS NOISE OUTSIDE... LIKE SOMEONE BREAKING IN.
</b>
<b>				PETER
</b>		Oh, no.

<b>	HE GRABS HER, AND SHE MOVES WITH HIM, WITHOUT RESISTANCE, AS
</b><b>	HE TURNS OUT THE LIGHTS INSIDE.
</b>
<b>	FLOODLIGHTS SUDDENLY ILLUMINATE THE FACADE OUTSIDE,
</b><b>	INCREASING THE BRILLIANCE OF THE LIGHT STREAMING IN AND
</b><b>	DARKENING THE SHADOWS FURTHER.  GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM.
</b>
	He leads her back to the stage... he pushes her into a chair
	facing him... He looks into her face and smiles...

<b>				PETER
</b>		We'll keep talking.  Until they get
		here.  Then...
			(smiles)

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I have no life anymore.  I ruined
		your life, make me pay for it.

<b>				PETER
</b>		Why did you do that?  Didn't you
		have any idea how hard it was for
		me, to get that far?  I worshipped
		you.  You inspired me.  I thought
		you could understand me the way you
		understood the others.  I knew that
		about you -- the ones you admired
		were the great murderers; they
		fascinated you.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		That's not who I admire -- I admire
		people who are good at what they
		do, great artists, writers,
		thinkers...

<b>				PETER
</b>		I don't have the talent for any of
		those things.  All I have a talent
		for is death.  And I am one of a
		kind.  What do you think of your
		student now?  I have made you
		famous, I am your creation and your
		monument.

<b>	BEHIND HIM A SHADOWY FIGURE DARTS FROM HIDING SPOT TO A
</b><b>	VANTAGE POINT: WE CAN'T MAKE OUT THE FIGURE... HELEN SEES
</b><b>	BUT PETER DOES NOT.
</b>
<b>				HELEN
</b>		If you let me, I can make you more
		famous than any of them.

<b>				PETER
</b>		Oh, please.  I know what's coming,
		now.  "Let me help you..."

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Do anything you want to me.  I give
		myself to you.  Only put the knife
		down.  Isn't this what you always
		wanted?  I know it's what we all
		want, to love and to loved.  I
		could love you.  You could work
		together in some safe place, learn
		to really understand you, help you,
		give you some peace of mind, some
		happiness...

<b>				PETER
</b>		Back in the driver's seat again,
		Doctor?  That old dream -- study us
		to see what makes us sick.  So you
		can find a cure -- they'd name it
		after you?  Death is the only cure
		for people like me.

	He leans toward her with the knife.  This might be the
	moment.  His gun lies on the floor beside him.

<b>	HER EYES HAVE FLICKED TO THE SHADOW BEHIND HIM; HE SEES IT
</b><b>	AND STOOPS TO PICK UP THE GUN AND FIRES INTO THE SHADOWS,
</b><b>	TWO OR THREE QUICK ROUNDS.  HE TURNS BACK TO HELEN, DROPPING
</b><b>	THE GUN TO REACH FOR THE KNIFE.
</b>
<b>	HELEN HEAD BUTTS HIM WITH ASTONISHING STRENGTH, KNOCKING HIM
</b><b>	BACKWARD.  SHE STANDS... HE COMES UP WITH GUN... AND AIMS AT
</b><b>	HER...
</b>
<b>	BEHIND HIM M.J. STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS HAVING NOW A CLEAN
</b><b>	SHOT.
</b>
<b>	HELEN DOESN'T GIVE A CLUE, JUST LOOKS INTO PETER'S EYES AS
</b><b>	M.J. AND PETER IN SLOW MOTION DETAILS AS SHE LINES UP HER
</b><b>	SHOT: SHE COULD KILL HIM OR GO FOR THE EXPOSED SHOULDER.
</b>
<b>				HELEN
</b>		Do it.  For God's sake, <u>now</u>...

<b>	M.J. FIRES.
</b>
<b>	PETER IS SPUN AWAY FROM HELEN BY THE IMPACT, STANDS THERE,
</b><b>	SHAKING WITH THE SHOCK OF THE HIT... HE STARES AT HER.
</b>
<b>				PETER
</b>			(surprised, like a
			 child)
		You hurt me!

<b>	M.J. HOLDS HER GUN ON HIM, READY TO SHOOT AGAIN, BUT HE JUST
</b><b>	GOES DOWN ON ONE KNEE, HIS BODY VIOLENTLY SHUDDERING... AS:
</b>
<b>	THERE IS A HUGE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS AND THEN AN ENORMOUS
</b><b>	EXPLOSION THAT THROWS THEM TO THE GROUND.
</b>
<b>	THE BIG FRONT DOORS ARE BLASTED OPEN, AND THE FLAK VESTED
</b><b>	SWAT TEAM SWARMS THROUGH... SMOKE FROM THE CONCUSSION
</b><b>	GRENADE SWIRLS IN THE CHIAROSCURO OF FLOODLIGHTS AND
</b><b>	SHADOWS.
</b>
<b>	OUT OF THE SMOKE COME SKI-MASKED SWAT MEN...
</b>
<b>				M.J. &amp; HELEN
</b>		No!!

<b>	PETER TURNS TO THE SWAT TEAM, OFFERING HIMSELF, AS THE WOMEN
</b><b>	SCREAM TO THE SWAT MEN'S WOUNDED AND HARMLESS...
</b>
<b>	A PATTERN OF RED DOTS FROM LASER BEAM SIGHTS ON THE SWAT
</b><b>	TEAM RIFLES DAPPLE PETER'S HEAD AND TORSO.
</b>
<b>	SWAT TEAM
</b>
<b>	LIKE A FIRING SQUAD THE TEAM FIRES.
</b>
<b>	PETER'S BODY FLIES THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE IMPACT AND
</b><b>	SLIDES SPRAWLING ACROSS THE STAGE TO A STOP.
</b>
<b>							CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER
</b>
<b>	M.J. SITS AS PARAMEDIC GENTLY PULL OFF HER SHIRT AND THE
</b><b>	BULLET PROOF VEST THAT SAVED HER LIFE.
</b>
<b>				M.J.
</b>		Jesus that hurts.  You think the
		rib is busted?

<b>				PARAMEDIC
</b>		That looks like just a bad bruise.
		I'll tape it up if you want to...

<b>				M.J.
</b>		I'll take some Tylenol and codeine,
		instead, how about a lot of number
		six?

	The medic turns to his medicine bag.  Cops swarm around
	them.  Helen sits down next to M.J.  M.J. begins to put on
	her shirt, wincing at the movement.  Helen helps her.

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(it hurts)
		Oh, God.

<b>	SAKS AND QUINN EMERGE THROUGH THE CHIAROSCURO OF SMOKE AND
</b>	LIGHT AND SHADOW.  When M.J. sees him she takes out her gun
	and hands it to him.  It is what he expects, but she
	misunderstands -- she is offering it to him as her
	resignation from the cops.  He takes it only as a part of
	officer related shooting routine.  SHE LOOKS INTO HIS FACE
<b>	AS HE SMELLS THE MUZZLE, KNOWS SHE FIRES IT, APPROVED.
</b>
<b>				QUINN
</b>		I'll take it, kid.  You take two
		weeks paid leave.  Don't waste a
		second thinking about that shitbag.
		Then come back.  You're a cop, M.J.

	He nods to Helen...

				QUINN (cont'd)
		Get the civilians outta here.

<b>				M.J.
</b>		She's in no shape to give her
		statement tonight...

<b>				QUINN
</b>		No, she can come in tomorrow...
		gonna want to know a lot of
		things...

	B.G. the cops have pulled PETER'S BODY BY THE FEET, LETTING
	HIM BUMPITY BUMPITY BUMPITY DOWN THE STEPS from the stage
	and lifted him onto a gurney.  The body is wheeled past
	them, as...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		The only one who could tell you
		what you really need to know is
		dead.

<b>				QUINN
</b>		Yeah, it's a thought...

	Of no importance to him, he turns away...

<b>	INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</b>
	In the LOBBY area between the auditorium proper and the big
	exterior doors (now the worse for wear from the concussion
	grenades).  Outside, through the glass we SEE a media circus
	under the BRIGHT LIGHTS put up for the assault.  M.J. and
<b>	HELEN SQUINT AGAINST THE LIGHT, AND TURN...
</b>
<b>	THE AUDITORIUM (POV).
</b>
	The cops and technicians are working away; at one side is a
	small door -- easy escape.  They run toward it...

<b>	EXT. MCCLUSKEY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</b>
	It is dark where they step out into the night.  Around the
	corner of the building we see the light from the MEDIA
<b>	CIRCUS.  THEN HELEN STEPS OFF DOWN INTO THE DARK CAMPUS.
</b><b>	M.J. LOOKS AT HER: REALIZING: HELEN IS NO LONGER AFRAID.
</b><b>	SHE CATCHES UP TO HER.  HOLD ON THEIR BACKS AS THEY WALK
</b><b>	AWAY...
</b>
<b>				M.J.
</b>		You could use a long hot bath, you
		know that?  You better get somebody
		to drive you home.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Why can't I drive home?  I will.
		You.  Look at you.  <u>You</u> need a ride
		home.  And you don't even know it.

<b>				M.J.
</b>			(beat)
		Well, thanks.

	The two women continue down toward Helen's car, just outside
	the circle of media.  CAMERA RISES AND RISES TO A HIGH FULL
<b>	SHOT.
</b>
	THE MOUTH AND THE HAIRCUT spot them and race toward them.

<b>				SUSAN
</b>		Hey!  Halloran!  What's the story
		here?

	On the two women getting in the car...

<b>				HELEN
</b>		If she has to ask, she's never
		gonna know.

<b>	HIGH FULLSHOT OF THE CAMPUS AS THEY DRIVE AWAY INTO THE
</b><b>	NIGHT.
