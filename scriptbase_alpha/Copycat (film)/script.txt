     INT. LECTURE HALL BERKELEY - DAY

     The hall is full.  On the stage, DR. HELEN HUDSON is
     speaking.  HELEN is a forensic psychologist.  Behind her is
     a projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA,
     FANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and
     TRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser
     pointing device.  We see her from a considerable
     distance... the back of the balcony.  Her voice is crisp and
     assured.

                    HELEN
          Our society creates these socially
          and psychically disenfranchised
          men, and their revenge on society
          is terrible.  They are hard to
          catch.  They are "the nice guy next
          door," their employers -- if they
          work at all -- find them quiet and
          uncomplaining.  Early abuse and
          rejection have taught them
          passivity.  Only in their violent
          fantasies do they feel alive.  What
          they seek in their frenzied
          assaults on their victims is relief
          from passivity.  For these men, ten
          minutes relief is worth far more
          than the life of another human
          being.  Torture, the pain they
          inflict, the screams of the victim,
          are all part of the ritual that
          gives them a brief respite from
          their own psychic pain.  And then
          the depression, the forgetting, the
          feeling of sadness and despair
          begins the cycle all over again.
          Like addicts seeking their drug,
          Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,
          Berkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they
          seek out their next victim.

     During the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera
     has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the
     balcony railing.

     CLOSEUP: HELEN

                    HELEN
          The cycle is endless until they are
          caught.  And they are caught by
          chance -- they run a red light, and
          a body is in the trunk.  A leaking     
          pipe brings a plumber to a basement
          where they is the smell of death.

     Her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in
     the balcony... Her voice chokes off.  She stares.

     HELEN'S POV:

     Sitting in the front row of the balcony, a YOUNG RED-HEADED
     MAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward, resting his tattooed
     arms on the railing.  He smiles intimately at HELEN.

     HELEN cuts her eyes to the left.  She sees:

     Backstage, an overweight COP in plain clothes.  Instantly
     alert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of
     exposing his presence to the audience.  A SECOND COP, in the
     wings on the other side of the stage, also springs to
     attention.  FIRST COP'S eyes follow HELEN'S...

     Their POV:  THE BALCONY - YOUNG RED-HEADED MAN is no longer
     there.

     HELEN  Can she believe her eyes?  Resumes:

                    HELEN
          At any time, right now, as you
          listen, the FBI estimates there are
          30 to 35 serial killers stalking
          their victims.  The serial killer is
          a plaque that must be addressed not
          only by the law, but by science.
          Florida spent eight million dollars
          to execute Ted Bundy.  It would
          have been better spent building a
          forensic penal facility devoted to
          research.

     Once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself
     that the smiling man is not there...

                    HELEN
          Confined for life, without parole,
          and subjected to scientific study,
          these men's lives might finally, in
          some small measure, educate and
          thereby protect society.  Thank
          you.

     Applause as Helen warily checks for the TWO COPS.  They are
     carefully casing the crowd.

                                        CUT TO:

     LATER:

     The crowd is breaking up.  FIRST COP walks HELEN to the
     ladies' room.  People reach to shake Helen's hand; she copes 
     as well as she can with her fear.  THEY LEAVE THE STAGE
     THROUGH A DOOR OPENING TO A CORRIDOR LEADING BACK TO
     DRESSING ROOMS AND A LADIES' ROOM...

                                        CUT TO:

     INT. LADIES' ROOM - DAY

     THE COP, clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks
     around.  Under one stall he sees a woman's HIGH HEELS.  He
     hastily ducks back into HALL and signals an okay to Helen.
     Before the door behind her closes, we see the COP prepare to
     stand guard outside.  HELEN walks past the stall with the
     high heels to a stall several doors down.

     CLOSE UP HIGH HEELS:

     And a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the
     ankles.  The shoes are kicked off.  The feet disappear from
     view as

     HELEN, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper
     around the seat before raising her skirt.  A faint noise
     makes her freeze.  Her hand reaches for the door.  She is
     just able to unlock it, but no more, before a NOISE COMES
     DOWN FROM THE NEXT STALL.

     Like a lariat it falls over HELEN'S head and is violently
     yanked tight.  She kicks at the stall door.

     CORRIDOR: COP, leaning against outside door smoking, hears
     the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. He
     reacts...

     INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUED

     The RED-HEADED MAN is struggling to secure the rope around a
     hook inside his own stall.  KNOCKING (o.s.)

                    COP (o.s.)
          Doctor Hudson?  Are you okay in
          there?

     The MAN lets slip a little slack.

     HELEN'S fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck,
     get just enough air for HELEN to let out a strangled little
     scream.

     CORRIDOR: COP, not certain what to do about the ambiguous
     sounds from inside.  Women stands nearby, inhibiting him for
     a split second from going in the Ladies' Room door.  Now
     there is more SOUND from inside...

     INT. LADIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     COP steps into the room, gun down.  Over the COP'S shoulder
     we see HELEN hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering at
     her throat.  She has one slippery shoeless foot on the
     toilet seat.

     COP takes a couple of steps forward.  Behind COP'S back we
     see a broom closet door opening.

     HELEN'S POV: CLOSE UP: The COP, taken from behind.  In a
     second, his throat is slit.  In a gush of  blood, he falls,
     his gun still in his hand.

     RED-HEADED MAN standing over the fallen COP, smiling at
     HELEN.

     COP'S BODY IS TWITCHING, JERKING.  The violent contractions
     in his fingers cause the gun to go off... ONE... TWO SHOTS,
     the sound reverberating against the tile walls.

     STAGE AREA

     The audience and SECOND COP react to the gunshots.
     HELEN, her eyes bulging, struggling against the rope.

                                        SLAM CUT:

     INT. HELEN'S APT - SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

     As HELEN, in bed, bolts up from the nightmare, her hands try
     desperately to pull the dream rope from her neck.  She is now
     pale, her hair is dirty, there are deep circles under her
     eyes.  This is a woman in the throes of a breakdown.

                    HELEN
          Andy!  Andy!

     She races through this LOFT APARTMENT (THE WALLS ARE EIGHT
     FEET UNDER A TWELVE-FOOT CEILING) to study opening off a
     hall.  She looks in, gasping for breathing...

     INT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS

     The room is neat -- nobody there.  (We will later see that it
     is used on and off by her computer, Andy.)

     HELEN whimpers in frustration; she is alone.  SHE TALKS TO
     HERSELF as she turns back and moves past a LIVING ROOM,
     where she turns on lights and the TV flicks on, (COURT TV.)
     The sound comes up, loud... She moves on... trying to calm
     herself with the sound of her own voice...

                    HELEN
          It is October twelfth, 1994 in the
          city of San Francisco, California,
          U.S.A., the strongest, richest,
          most stable and happiest country in
          the world.  That is the sole place
          of life in the universe.  Under
          God.

     CLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  Two pills are shaken out into a palm,
     others scattering from the nervous haste...

     CLOSE: HELEN  Watching herself in BATHROOM mirror as she
     tosses down the pills, gulps water.  She regards her haggard
     reflection with a certain detachment...

                    HELEN
          Good God.  What happened to you?

     She barks a rueful laugh... we are seeing a woman will
     herself from near-hysteria to relative calm...

                                        CUT TO:

     HALL  As she exits the bathroom.  And moves into her OFFICE.
     She pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers.
     Of the side-by-side computer screens, one is blank.  The
     other shows a chess setup.  Flashing on the bottom of the
     screen comes a command.

                    CHESSMASTER
          'It's almost seven.  Make a goddam
          move.'

     She studies the chess set-up for a moment, then makes a
     move.  She has not even hit the Keyboard of the other
     computer before CHESSMASTER sends another message.

                    CHESSMASTER
          'Lousy move.  Not really into this
          game, Helen.  Let's drop it.  I've
          got a feeling about you.  Let's
          meet.  Like a date.'

     HELEN types the following to CHESSMASTER.

                    HELEN
          'I'm a terrible date.  I'd mess up your
          life.'

                    CHESSMASTER
          'Another romantic dream gone all to
          hell.'

                    HELEN
          'Maybe it's better to just dream
          on; avoid the disappointments of
          life.  Come on, move.'

     She pushes a button on the remote, and we see the window
     curtains open.  BRIGHT SUNLIGHT STREAMS IN!  We see that the
     T-shirt HELEN wears says "Shrinks 'R' Us."  She crosses to
     the window with her glass of cognac, looks out.

     VIEW:

     A sweeping view of the bay, and across to Marin County.  The
     morning sun is dispelling the last of the night's fog.
     HELEN opens window, puts a hand outside, trying to feel the
     air, the freedom.  Feeling quite restored from the dream
     horror of the night...

     O.S., THE PHONE RINGS.  HELEN.  A FRISSON.

     CLOSE: PHONE  Her hand comes into FRAME and picks up the
     handset and carries CAMERA TO CLOSEUP HELEN.

                    HELEN
               (carefully)
          Yes?
               (listens)
          You son-of-a-bitch!  Son of
          a bitch...

     Stiff with fear and rage, she slams down phone.

                    HELEN
          You filthy... son of a bitch!

     On the computer screen behind her the Chessmaster makes his
     move: the computer speaks in its tiny computer voice:

                    COMPUTER
               (filter)
          You Queen is in check.
          Protect your Queen.

     OVER CREDITS:

     HOME MOVIE of a young woman dressed in a seat suit.  It is
     morning, and she is jogging on a park path.  Her hair is in
     a long braid.  She is sweating, breathing heavily, clearly
     near the end of a satisfactory run.

     THE FILM REVERSES, THE FILM STARTS UP AGAIN IN EXTREMELY
     SLOW MOTION.  WE ARE NOW AWARE THERE IS ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW
     AT WORK HERE.

     NOW THE FRAME FREEZES AT A POINT WHERE IT MAKES THE JOGGER'S
     OPEN-MOUTHED DEEP BREATHING LOOK LIKE

     A SCREAM!

     END TITLE AND CREDITS:

     INT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY

     MUZZLE OF SEMI AUTOMATIC PISTOL BLASTS NINE SHOTS ALMOST
     DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA.  A BEAT OF SILENCE...

     THE TARGET: it is a silhouette of a man's head and torso;
     centered in the right side of the upper chest, near the
     shoulder, is a small red circle.  Still SMOKING, THE HOLES
     FROM THE BULLETS are scattered all over the chest, and none
     in the circle.

                    M.J. (V.O.)
          My third grade teacher at the
          convent shot better than that.

     THE SHOOTER, RUBEN GOETZ, AND PARTNER M.J.

                    RUBEN
          Yeah, but she had divine guidance.

     We now take in the shooter, RUBEN, and his companion M.J.
     HALLORAN.  M.J. is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking
     young woman.  She is neat, buttoned down, crisp.  M.J.
     appears to be about twenty-five.  She is, in fact,
     thirty-four and a homicide inspector with the rank of
     sergeant.  She is usually dressed in slacks and a loose
     sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear
     even smaller and younger than she is.

     RUBEN GOETZ is also in homicide, about twenty-six and junior
     in authority to M.J.  RUBEN is good-looking, good-humored
     and laid back.  He has a cellular phone attached to his
     belt.

     M.J. PULLS THE LINE THAT DOLLIES THE TARGET BACK TO THEM,
     AND RUBEN REPLACES IT WITH ANOTHER AS THEY TALK.

                    M.J.
          I'd feel a whole lot safer with
          Sister Loretta for my backup.  Look
          at this guy: you shredded him!

                    RUBEN
          Well, he's dead, he can't hurt me
          now.

     The target is rigged; they pull the line that dollies it back 
     to shooting position.

                    M.J.
          It's sloppy shooting.  It's in
          character, Ruben, but unnecessary.
          And bad for your career.

     RUBEN LETS OFF THREE QUICK SHOTS: they cluster nearer the
     circle.  M.J. looks at him in surprise.

                    RUBEN
          I've been practicing.  Now can I
          kiss your tummy?

     M.J. hides her smile as she prepares her weapon for her turn.

                    M.J.
          Perp's holding a hostage, the
          shoulder on his gun hand is gonna
          be exposed.

     SOUND: A CELLULAR PHONE (ON RUBENS' BELT).  M.J. holds her
     fire.

                    M.J.
          Answer it.

                    RUBEN
          I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't
          you at least interested in which
          one it is?

     She's lost her concentration lowered the gun; now as he
     answers, she raises her gun and aims...

                    RUBEN
               (into phone)
          I'm here, where are you?...
          Heeeeyyy!  What a surprise!  No.  On
          duty, have to call you back... You,
          too, you too.  My God, you made my
          day.

     He hits the "end" button...

                    M.J.
          You hit the brachial nerve...

     SHE FIRES!  The shots make a perfect heart around the circle,
     inside his looser pattern.  ONE FINAL SHOT STRIKES EXACTLY
     IN THE MIDDLE!

                    M.J.
          You're good enough you'll never
          have to kill anyone.  I joined the
          cops to save lives, not waste them.

                    RUBEN
          You know, M.J., when I watch you
          shoot, I realize I've got a little
          problem with my stance... could you
          just move over here and critique my
          legs?

     He slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be.
     She is unloading her weapon...

                    M.J.
          The problem is between your legs.
          You told your shrink about that?

     She is unloading and cleaning up.  Ruben doing the same...

                    RUBEN
          I tell my shrink about you,
          Sergeant.  I tell him you're the
          top cop of my dreams.

     Ruben has been gathering up his box of doughnuts, from which
     he has nibbled during the preceding... he drops them, picks
     one up off the floor and sticks it in his mouth...

                    M.J.
               (putting away her
                gear)
          Don't take that mess in the car.

     They're on the move; as they go away from us...

                    RUBEN
          He's in love with you already...

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

     They pull up in front of an apartment building in the
     Pacific Heights section.  Patrol cars flank the street, the
     thick yellow ticker tape "POLICE CRIME SCENE DO NOT CROSS"
     is already up.  M.J. double parks beside a blue-and-white.
     A couple of cars from the media are already there.  SUSAN
     SCHIFFER a bulldog of a woman, and her camera crew, waylay
     M.J. and Ruben as they cross the sidewalk...

                    M.J.
          Oh, Christ, the Mouth is already
          here.

     She is, with a cameraman with a haircut and smile that speak
     of a life of orthodontics and dreams of TV anchorship.

                    RUBEN
          Hey.  And there's the Haircut right
          behind.  If she stops short he's
          gonna be there feet up her ass...

                    SUSAN
               (on camera)
          Inspector, can you...

                    M.J.
          I just got here myself, Susan.

                    SUSAN
          ...confirm this third murder adds
          up to a pattern?  Do we have a
          serial killer on the loose in the
          city?

                    M.J.
          I just got here.  Talk to you
          later...

                    M.J.
               (as they escape behind the
                barrier tape)
          What the hell does she want to do,
          scare everybody to death?

                    RUBEN
          That's her job... Jesus, Quinn is
          here already.

     QUINN, a splenetic Irishman, a politician, Chief of Homicide
     stands at the top of the steps leading to the front door.
     As they climb up toward him...

                    QUINN
          I been waiting... I have to do
          everything myself.  Photo, crime
          tech, the Coroner are already
          inside.  The Landlady calls it in;
          tenant is not answering when
          called, she sticks her head in,
          sees the body, uses the deceased's
          telephone to call 911.  Otherwise
          nothing disturbed.  It's all yours,
          kid.  I'll take care of the Mouth
          and the Haircut.

     M.J. and Ruben enter...

     INT. APARTMENT HOUSE - HALL - DAY

     Four uniformed cops stand in the hall securing the premises;
     at the back one cop stands by a stunned and tearful woman
     chain-smoking (the Landlady).

                    M.J.
               (to cop)
          That the Landlady?
               (to Ruben)
          You wanna talk to her, Ruben?
               (back to cops)
          Who was first on the scene?

     Mike answers her question by answering to Ruben!

                    MIKE
          I was.

                    M.J.
               (forcefully)
          I'm over here?  What's your name,
          Officer?

                    MIKE
          Michael Johnson.

                    M.J.
          You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up
          anything?  Use the doorknob?  I
          don't want to find your prints on
          anything later and you tell me you
          forgot to tell me.

                    MIKE
          No.  I didn't.

     She glances at him, at the SLIGHTLY OLD INFLECTION ON THE "I
     DIDN'T."  But moves on, as Ruben goes to the Landlady...

     INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     The same YOUNG WOMAN we saw jogging, is now dead.  Hair
     still in a long braid.  She wears only a blouse, open and
     pushed back.  She is on her back in the bathtub, with one
     leg dangling over the side of the tub.  The effect is
     slightly posed, but casual, relaxed.

     Bending over her is DOC, the Coroner, WITHDRAWING A HUGE
     MEAT THERMOMETER FROM HER SIDE.

     M.J. APPEARS IN THE BACK OF THE SHOT taking in the scene.
     Foreground, Doc reads the thermometer.  The photographer is
     finishing up his shots.  The room is crowded.  Two Coroner's
     men wait in the doorway, a stretcher standing on end between
     them; M.J. has to pass between them to come down to the
     body.  THROUGHOUT WE FOCUS ON M.J.'S FACE; HER REACTION TO
     THE SCENE, RATHER THAN DWELLING ON THE SCENE ITSELF.  
     
     ON M.J.:
     
                    DOC (V.O.)
          Liver and rigor are telling me
          about eight hours.  I'm gonna take
          her out now if it's alright.

                    M.J.
          I'm seeing ligature marks on her
          neck here, petechial hemorrhages in
          her eyes.  Strangled.

                    DOC
          You got it.  Same as the other two.

     THE TELEPHONE RINGS.

                    COP (V.O.)
          Tell whoever she can't come to the
          phone, she's all tied up.

     Nobody laughs...

                    M.J.
          That's real old material, get a new
          writer...

     She picks up the phone after the second ring, holding
     it in tissue someone hands her...

                    M.J.
          Hello?

                    PHONE VOICE
               (extremely cheerful)
          Hello!  This is Geena Martinez, how
          are you this morning?

                    M.J.
          What is this about, Ms Martinez?

                    PHONE VOICE
          I'm conducting a telephone survey
          to determine whether you're
          satisfied with your insurance on
          your personal valuables...

     M.J. gently hangs up the phone.  She has been looking at the
     Dead Woman... They pick up where they left off.

                    DOC
          He used something soft, like a
          stocking or a bathrobe tie.

                    M.J.
          Anybody find it?

     No answer as the Coroner's men crowd in beside M.J. to begin
     lifting the body out of the tub.  M.J. takes one last look
     into the dead woman's eyes...

                    M.J.
          Cover her up, please.

     INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     Ruben still talking to the Landlady and taking notes.  M.J.
     approaches Mike... takes him aside...

                    M.J.
          Mike.  Why don't you tell me what's
          bothering you?

     Mike is acutely uncomfortable.

                    M.J.
          Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out
          and sooner is a hell of lot better
          than later.

                    MIKE
          Well, there's something missing in
          there.  There was something around
          her neck when I came in there, but
          it's gone now.

                    M.J.
          Who came in after you?

                    MIKE
          Lieutenant  Quinn.

     She seems relieved.  Brightly:

                    M.J.
          Well, it's all right, then, Mike.
          Thanks.

     EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY

     In the door, M.J. appears, looking out thoughtfully over the
     scene; Ruben appears behind her.  The photographer is coming
     out...

                    M.J.
               (to Photographer)
          Get me good faces on the crowd
          here.  Get a couple of harness bulls
          to grab anybody who starts to
          run...

                    PHOTOGRAPHER
          Don't tell your Grandmother how to
          suck eggs.  I only been doing this
          work since your junior prom,
          darling...

     But M.J. is already on to other things.

     INT. HELEN'S OUTSIDE HALLWAY - DAY

     CLOSE ON A FOLDED NEWSPAPER THAT LIES ON THE FLOOR FIVE OR
     FIX FEET FROM THE DOOR TO HELEN'S APARTMENT.  HOLD DOOR IN
     B.G.

     The door opens and Helen looks out, wasted from cognac and
     Xanax.  She looks for the newspaper and sees it with a look
     of despair.

     HELEN'S POV

     The newspaper lies there, out of reach.

     HELEN

     As she stretches out her foot toward the paper, can't reach
     it.

     POV.  As she moves out into the hall her agoraphobia
     manifests itself: DISTORTED VISION THAT MAKES THE HALL
     STRETCH AND THE WALLS TAKE ON EXAGGERATED PERSPECTIVE;
     SICKENING -- VERTIGO!  The newspaper seems further away.

     HELEN  She drops to her knees and tries to lean out further
     into the hall...

     POV.  The floor seems to melt and roll in waves toward her.
     The newspaper melts like a Dali watch.

     HELEN sweats.  She lies flat on her stomach and crawls toward
     the newspaper... and with a supreme effort grabs it and
     squirms back inside.

     INT. APARTMENT - DAY

     As she slams the door shut on the hall, and sits gasping for
     breath.  After a moment she can bring herself to look at the
     newspaper... INSERT:

     POLICE BAFFLED IN DEATHS OF THE WOMEN

                    HELEN (V.O.)
          Damn fools!

     INT. QUINN'S OFFICE - DAY

     QUINN is watching a portable TV screen with profound distrust.
     Onscreen is SUSAN SCHIFFER.

                    SUSAN
          ... continues to stonewall the
          public.  Now...

     There is a knock, but before QUINN can respond, M.J. enters.

                    M.J.
          You messed with the scene.

                    QUINN
          Shut up.

     He and M.J. both listen to SUSAN.

                    SUSAN
          ... third Bay Area woman has been
          strangled, but the police continue
          to deny that this is the work of
          one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn
          declares that the murders will be
          treated as unrelated crimes, unless
          new evidence...

     M.J. TURNS OFF THE TV, FACES QUINN...

                    M.J.
          You messed with the evidence.

                    QUINN
          I tagged the goddamned stocking.
          It ain't lost.  We're sequestering
          that evidence.  That's the trap some
          son of a bitch is going to fall
          into...

                    M.J.
          Am I in charge of this thing?  Or
          not.

                    QUINN
          I said you were...

                    NH
          Then I decided what evidence we
          choose to sequester.

                    QUINN
               (a beat here)
          Okay.  What do you want to
          sequester?

                    M.J.
          The stocking around the neck.

     A long moment of looking at each other.  Then...

                    QUINN
          You didn't say serial killer and I
          didn't say serial killer.

                    M.J.
          Right.

                    QUINN
               (not satisfied she
                really means it)
          This is the anniversary of the
          summer of love and your city
          fathers have declared a Festival of
          Love.  The Mayor and Chamber of
          Commerce don't want TV announcing
          killers on the loose.

                    M.J.
          Right.

     And she starts to go...

                    QUINN
          We're gonna have a bunch of clapped

     INT. SQUAD ROOM - DAY

     This large room is very busy, many officers at work.  Known
     sexual offenders have been rounded up.  False confessors add
     to the crowd.  Detectives who are not dealing with these
     people are making and taking calls.  At this desk, a tall
     intense looking Detective, NICCOLETTI, interrogates a false
     confessor, a man who looks like a businessman...

                    NIKKO
          Harvey, I don't want you in here no
          more, making false statements...

                    CONFESSOR
          They are not false.  We pay for
          city government like this, you
          don't even care about the truth?!
          I killed her in the bathtub.

                    NIKKO
          Why?

                    CONFESSOR
          Because she was dirty, a dirty
          girl!

                    NIKKO
          How?  How did you do it, Harvey?

                    HARVEY
          With a knife?

                    NIKKO
          Good guess, but not good enough.
          Get the fuck outta here...

     He has stood as M.J. passes coming from Quinn's office.  He
     falls into stride with her through the crowded scene... He
     is sweaty and sniffs his armpits as a matter of general
     hygiene checkup...

                    NIKKO
          What am I wasting my time with this
          shit for?

                    M.J.
          Because it's your job, that's all.

                    NIKKO
          Not what I meant; why me?

                    M.J.
               (cutting)
          Maybe it's something you did in
          this life, Nikko...

     It has the flavor of a spoiled intimacy, an unfinished
     argument... He pantomimes she got him with a poison dart.

                    NIKKO
          Got me.  That really hurt!  You...

     Ruben joins them; Nikko stifles and turns away...

               (to Ruben)
          Get Mercer to run the medical,
          dental, legal bills, laundry and
          dry cleaning receipts, extermin-
          ators, mailmen, grocery and
          drugstore deliveries, handymen,
          plumbers...

                    RUBEN
          It's mostly done, they got nobody
          in common, the three of them... No
          mutual friends -- the Landlady says
          nobody was ever there, she never
          saw her with anybody.

     They are approaching PACHULSKI'S desk.  PACHULSKI is on
     phone.  Pachulski is looking at M.J., grinning...

                    PACHULSKI
               (into phone)
          Yes, ma'am, I know.  You can't talk
          her right now... because she's 
          busy, she's all tied up.
               (sotto to M.J.)
          Deep Throat's back.

     He hits the speaker phone...

                    FEMALE PHONE VOICE
          This is the third one.  You've got
          a serial killer here.  When are you

                    PACHULSKI
               (whispering)
          Fourteen calls from this broad.
          And she ain't stupid.

     M.J. signals for GIGI to trace the call.  Takes the phone,
     switches off the speaker...

                    M.J.
          Inspector Halloran, Homicide.  I'm
          in charge here.

                    PACHULSKI
               (amused)
          Ask her about the moon bike.

                    M.J.
          I'm really interested in your
          ideas.  The moon bike.  What is
          that?

                    HELEN
          What is wrong with you people?
          The first two, I thought he might
          be on a lunar cycle because they
          were 28 days apart, but obviously
          not.  This new one is only two
          weeks.

     Pachulski is delighted at the joke he's played on M.J., M.J.
     not so much... Gigi signals they're getting it.

                    HELEN (cont'd)
          You want to joke about moonbikes?!

                    M.J.
          No, ma'am.  This is no joke.  And
          neither is tying up telephone lines
          to police with crank calls while
          people in trouble are trying to get
          through for help.

                    HELEN
          You're calling me a crank?

                    M.J.
          Do you have any evidence to report,
          ma'am?  Do you know any of the
          victims...

                    HELEN
          I think this is number three...

                    M.J.
               (over her)
          That's an opinion, not evidence...

     Gigi hands her a slip of paper... M.J. reads it... glares
     at Pachulski who is still laughing.  M.J. knows the name on
     the slip of paper...

     INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

     HELEN, now wearing slippers and shorts with the same T-shirts
     she slept in, is standing behind the living room curtains
     looking down at the street.  She hears a code knock, then a
     key turns in the lock.  She moves to greet ANDY her
     assistant and friend.  ANDY is laden down with groceries and
     mail.  HELEN immediately reaches a hand up to touch his
     face...

                    HELEN
          Where were you?  Don't tell me.
          It's just under seventy, right?  The
          sun is strong but the air is dry
          and fresh...

                    ANDY
          Would you please get your hands off
          my face, Tallulah?  What happened
          to the newspaper?

     He withdraws a popsicle from the bag, offers it to her.
     When she rejects it, he takes it for himself.

                    HELEN
          I got it myself... I couldn't wait.

                    ANDY
          Well!  Aren't we the daring one?
          What's morbid and ghastly enough in
          the news to make Doctor Helen set
          foot outside her door?  The antenna
          is gone off her car again.  I had
          no music, all the way to the
          market.  Let me find a garage for
          it?

     They're in the kitchen area; Andy unpacking stuff...
     expensive goodies...

                    HELEN
          I've told you:  I can't afford to
          garage it.

                    ANDY
          Are you kidding?  You buy enough
          gourmet junk every week... most of
          which rots... to garage a fleet of
          stretch limos.

                    HELEN
          I had the dream again.
               (beat)
          And I got another call.  This time
          he spoke.  He said "You and me, you
          and me."

                    ANDY
          A little heavy breathing is what
          most of us yearn for.  Forget it.

                    HELEN
          He whispered, but it was him!  I
          know it was him!

     Andy now stops to address this seriously...

                    ANDY
          He can't phone you unless the
          warden gets an okay from you.  Did
          you give him an approval?

                    HELEN
          Andy?  When a three-year-old says
          there's a monster under the bed,
          you don't say 'forget it'.  You
          look under the bad.
               (beat)
          I'm three years old.  Call the
          prison.

     Her fear is so palpable, she is so nakedly vulnerable it
     breaks his heart.  He puts his arms around her.

                    HELEN
          Oh God.  I'm really crazy.

                    ANDY
          When was the last time you washed
          your hair?

                    HELEN
               (shaky, but trying)
          Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my
          coiffure?

                    ANDY
          Monsieur Andy can smell your
          coiffure.  And guess what else?

     He pats her thighs... she walks to the window as he talks...

                    ANDY
          Cellulite.  What do you say I
          blindfold you and take you to the
          gym.  Aerobics with housewives...

     HELEN AT WINDOW

                    HELEN
          Andy?

     Andy has heard this tone before:  panic attack alert.

                    ANDY
          Here we go again.

     ANGLE AT WINDOW TO INCLUDE THEIR POV OF STREET

     In a parked car a man is reading a newspaper that hides his
     face.  Behind him is parked a slightly beat up red Saab.

                    HELEN
          You parked right behind him.  The
          one I noticed earlier.  I didn't
          say anything, I thought he'd leave.
          Just take a look.

                    ANDY
          Oh my God!  Help!  HE'S READING A
          NEWSPAPER!

                    HELEN
          But earlier, he was staring up
          here.  Please, Andy.

                    ANDY
          Okay.  You win.  'Dirty Harry'
          coming up.

     ANDY leaves the apartment.

     EXT. FRONT DOOR OF HELEN'S BUILDING - DAY

     The heavy old industrial door is pushed slightly open, ANDY
     peers out, sees:

     ANDY crosses behind the car and then sneaks back, coming
     up to Driver's side window, surprising the Driver.
     THE NEWSPAPER DROPS:  IT'S RUBEN.

                    ANDY
          Excuse me, but would you mind
          explaining why you're watching the
          lady upstairs?

                    RUBEN
          None of your fucking business.

     Usurping RUBEN'S aggressive attitude, ANDY leans his face
     close to RUBEN'S window.

                    ANDY
          Listen, asshole, I've got a gun...

     RUBEN grabs ANDY by the collar and yanks his head inside the
     car.  With the other hand he pulls his gun and pushes it up
     ANDY'S nose.

                    RUBEN
          I hate this...

                    ANDY
          Only kidding!

     RUBEN pushes the 'up' button on the window, capturing ANDY'S
     head in a deadlock.  Then he opens the door, gets out, slams
     door, forcing the squawking ANDY into a helpless frisk
     position.  We HEAR HELEN scream, (O.S.).  Ignoring this,
     RUBEN begins to frisk ANDY.

     M.J. APPROACHING IN HER OWN CAR, SEES THE ACTION, BRAKES
     FAST AND GETS OUT.

     HELEN at window, shouting.

                    HELEN
          I'm calling the police!

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Andy enters, followed by Ruben and M.J., who holds up her
     badge to Helen.

                    M.J.
          Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I
          apologize for Goetz, he's a
          firehouse dog.

                    ANDY
               (trying to defuse)
          I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed
          it.

     Uncomfortable silence for a beat as they try to take in
     what's happening, who's who and what's what.  Helen is
     confused, fighting back fear...

                    M.J.
               (trying to communicate
                here)
          Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor
          impulse control.

                    HELEN
          Is he out?

                    M.J.
          Who?

                    HELEN
               (to Andy)
          If he's not out, why are they here?

                    M.J.
          Because of your phone calls.

                    HELEN
          What calls?  I haven't made any
          calls.

                    ANDY
               (to distract)
          Are you staying long?  Shall I shut
          the door?  Make your coffee?  Make
          the beds?

                    M.J.
               (to Helen)
          You talked to me.  Do you remember?

     The two women measure each other, Helen struggling to
     control herself.  A beat.

                    HELEN
          You were the one that talked about
          moonbikes and called me a crank?
          Oh God, I am!
               (to Andy)
          Make them some coffee.
               (to M.J.)
          Halloran, is it?  Investigator
          Goetz?  I had a crank call myself--
          he said...
               (a moment of real
                fear)
          I thought it might be Daryll Lee
          Cullum.  I thought he might be out
          of prison.

                    RUBEN
          Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think
          so.  If he's escaped we'd have the
          National Guard, cops'd be crawling
          through sewers.  You'd have a guard
          on your front door.

                    M.J.
               (looking around)
          I want to tell you it's a great
          honor to meet you and talk to you.

                    HELEN
          You don't admire me.  No police
          admire me.  I got one of you
          killed.  Why don't you say right
          out what you're here for?

                    M.J.
          You called us, Doctor Hudson.

                    HELEN
          Yes, I did.  Poor impulse control.
          The accounts of the firs two
          murders made it so clear they were
          the work of the same man, but you
          kept announcing they were
          unrelated.  You'll never catch him
          that way.

     M.J. regards her for a moment...

                    M.J.
               (to Andy)
          Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take
          mine black.
               (beat)
          You're absolutely correct.  The
          politicians don't want panic
          headlines spoiling the Festival of
          Love.

                    HELEN
          Well, let's thank God you and
          Inspector Goetz are on the case,
          then.

                    M.J.
          Would you want to work with us on
          this?

                    HELEN
          Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical
          hysteric, with panic syndrome, and
          anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm
          afraid of everything, real and
          imaginary.  I never leave this
          apartment now.  Nobody ever comes
          here.  I just wanted to get your
          attention.  I write and I used to
          lecture on these crimes, but... I'm
          not competent.

                    M.J.
          I think you are.  I really admire
          everything you've done; it would be
          an honor to work with you, and we
          need all the help we can get,
          especially yours.

                    HELEN
          Inspector Halloran, that is so much
          bullshit, you don't like or admire
          me, but the beautiful part is I
          don't give a fuck.  That's the
          upside of having a breakdown.

                    M.J.
          Well, it's a hell of an apartment
          you got here.  I'm living one step
          away from the projects, myself, but
          I get to go to work every day,
          wading in blood and guts.  I guess
          the books you wrote about these
          sons of bitches paid off pretty
          good.

                    HELEN
          Will you go.  Andy, make them go.

                    M.J.
          You can't go out lecturing?  Tough
          shit.  Women are dying.  Where can
          I lay this stuff out?

     She dumps files of photos, etc., out on Helen's cocktail
     table.

                    HELEN
          I don't want this.  What are they?

                    RUBEN
          You called us, Doctor, if you don't
          want to look at them here, how
          about downtown.  I'll drive you
          down...

     She pushes the pictures off onto the floor, tries to get up
     to leave the room.  M.J. and Ruben are both appalled at the
     force of what is happening: an all-out panic attack...

     Andy races t o the kitchen; Ruben tries to help but Helen
     fights him off viciously, gasping for air... Andy races
     back in with a PLASTIC BAG HE PULLS OVER HELEN'S HEAD AND
     FACE...  She hyperventilates into the bag...

     THE PLASTIC BAG BALLOONS OUT AND BACK IN HELEN'S FACE until
     she faints.  Andy deals with it like an everyday event,
     treating her very gently...

                    ANDY
               (to Ruben)
          Now look what you did.

                    RUBEN
          What did I do?

                    ANDY
          You threatened to drive her
          downtown.  She has agoraphobia.

                    RUBEN
          Fear of what...

                    ANDY
          Open space.  She hasn't been out of
          this apartment in three years.  I
          didn't used to think it was real...

     He's making her comfortable.

                    M.J.
          We'll get the paramedics...

                    ANDY
          Oh, God, uniforms, more stress.
          Let her sleep.  It's a self-limiting:
          she hyperventilates till she passes
          out, then her breathing goes back
          to normal, and she wakes up singing
          like a lark.
               (rocking the
                unconscious Helen)
          We know, don't we, Princess?
               (to them)
          Give her a couple of hours.  I know
          about this.

     M.J. starts to gather up the pictures and files.  She is
     angry and disgusted.

                    M.J.
          Tell her we're sorry we bothered
          her.

                    ANDY
          Hey, no.  Leave those here.  If you
          really want her help.  I mean if
          you really do, leave them.  Let her
          see them.  I'll see they're safe...

     M.J. takes in the scene; the now soundly sleeping Helen;
     Andy sitting over her protectively, the files and photos
     strewn around.  Makes a decision...

                    M.J.
          Tell her to ask for me...

     She's handing Andy her card...

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. HELEN'S APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

     M.J. AND RUBEN come out in the street...  CAMERA IN A HIGH
     ANGLE LOOKING DOWN ON THEM...

                    M.J.
          Snotty neurotic bitch...

                    RUBEN
               (amused)
          Classy madonna.

                    M.J.
          Sure.  She likes you, Rube.  She
          likes the way you move.  She sure
          as hell isn't in love with me.

                    RUBEN
          You came in there with this
          attitude...

                    M.J.
               (over him)
          Order Chinese for us and meet me
          the library?  Anything but beef.

     She jumps in her car, still steaming, leaving Ruben to move
     to his car.  AS HE MOVES CAMERA FOLLOWS, BECOMING A WIDER
     ANGLE TO INCLUDE FACADE OF HELEN'S APARTMENT.

     We can SEE ANDY, SITTING WHERE WE LEFT HIM, HOLDING HELEN IN
     HIS ARMS.  SHE SLEEPS PEACEFULLY.  DISTANTLY WE HEAR THE
     PHONE RING.  ANDY SHOWS IMPATIENCE, THEN CAREFULLY
     DISENGAGES FROM HELEN SO AS NOT TO DISTURB HER SLEEP.

     HE MOVES ACROSS THE ROOM UNTIL HE IS OUT OF FRAME.  THE SHOT
     HOLDS ON HELEN FOR A BEAT.  PHONE RINGS.

     THEN THE CAMERA PANS LEFT (OUR FIRST CLUE THIS IS ANOTHER
     POINT OF VIEW) ACROSS TO A SECOND WINDOW WHERE IT CATCHES
     ANDY MOVING UNTIL WE AGAIN DISAPPEARS BEHIND THE BUILDING
     WALL AND THE CAMERA PANS SMOOTHLY TO THE THIRD WINDOW, WHERE
     ANDY ENTERS.  WE SEE HIM PICK UP THE PHONE AND SPEAK INTO
     IT.  HE SEEMS IMPATIENT.

     THEN CAMERA PANS DOWN TO A CELLULAR PHONE, F.G. AND FOCUS
     RACKS TO E.C.U. AS A FINGER PUSHES THE "END" BUTTON.

     CLOSE: ANDY

     Putting down the phone.  Irritated...

                    ANDY
          Shit...

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. POLICE LIBRARY - DAY

     CLOSE: AN ATTORNEY IN COURT

                    ATTORNEY
          ... it was your feeling after
          careful evaluation that he was a
          sexual sadist who satisfied at
          least four out of ten criteria in
          the DMS III?

     SHOW M.J. and Ruben watching videotapes, and eating Chinese
     takeout.  HELEN is being interrogated by the ATTORNEY for
     Daryll Lee Cullum.  Helen sure of herself to the point of
     arrogance, which is her undoing...

                    HELEN
          Yes.  Without question.

                    ATTORNEY
          Without question?  He only scored
          40 percent, four out of ten
          criteria?  Couldn't another expert
          say he flunked the sexual sadist
          test?  What curve are you marking
          on, Doctor?

                    HELEN
          The test criteria are only part of
          what we look at in evaluating
          subjects.

                    ATTORNEY
          Only part.  What else?  What did
          you think of his claim that he tied
          this girl to the tree and set fire
          to her because Joan of Arc told him
          to do it.

                    HELEN
          He was lying.

                    ATTORNEY
          'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked
          you what you thought, not what he
          did.

                    HELEN
          I thought he was lying.

                    ATTORNEY
          You said, first, he was lying.  How
          do you know that, Doctor?

                    HELEN
          Because people who are suffering
          from aural hallucinations hear
          voices in both ears.  Daryll Lee
          told me that Joan of Arc always
          appeared beside him on his left
          side and spoke softly in his left
          ear.

     Murmur of subdued laughter in court.

                    HELEN
               (emboldened)
          He took pains to hide his actions
          because he knew they were morally
          wrong.  He was not acting on mad
          impulse.  He was sane and acting
          out a pattern he carefully followed
          every time.

                    ATTORNEY
               (playing causal)
          What pattern was that?

                    HELEN
          The same as the first time...

     She catches herself.  The D.A. has leapt to his feet, but now
     tries to sit down as though nothing was happening, but
     Helen, the Attorney and the D.A. all are clearly disturbed
     by the line this questioning is taking.

                    ATTORNEY
          The first what?
               (as she hesitates)
          Your Honor, she's got this far, I
          think she should finish.  I don't
          think this jury should be left
          wondering where the rest of her
          statement would lead.

                    JUDGE
          I agree, Doctor.

                    HELEN
          The first two murders.

                    ATTORNEY
          What first two murders.  We don't
          know about them here, do we?

                    HELEN
               (giving up)
          He told me he had done two others
          just like it.

                    ATTORNEY
          When was that?

                    HELEN
          When he was seventeen.

                    ATTORNEY
          And you believed him when he told
          you he had done that.

                    HELEN
          Yes.  I believed him.

     The D.A. is rushing to the bench to argue with the Judge.

                    JUDGE (V.O.)
          Yes, I'll accept a call for a
          mistrial.  Evidence of that other
          crime when the defendant was a
          juvenile is inadmissible and never
          should have been heard by this
          jury...

     FREEZE FRAMES.

     NOW WE SEE M.J. AND RUBEN LOOKING AT HELEN on the TV screen,
     THINKING...

     THE DOOR OPENS AND QUINN ENTERS.

                    QUINN
          There was no sperm.

                    M.J.
          The same as the firs two.
          Definitely a serial.

                video)
          What are you looking at that for?
          Helen Hudson.  Work the clues.

                    M.J.
          What clues?  I'm going to work
          Helen Hudson.

                    QUINN
          Would you step outside, Sergeant?

     M.J. leaves a cautiously silent RUBEN.  Once the door shuts,
     he turns tape back to 'play.'

     EXT. OUTSIDE DOOR TO LIBRARY - DAY

                    QUINN
          I'm telling you.  Don't you ever
          address me publicly in that tone.
          You'll work what and who I tell you
          to work.

                    M.J.
          Anybody in this department ever
          worked a serial killer case?  She's
          the expert.  I need help.

                    QUINN
          How about I put Nikko on it?

                    M.J.
          That's always your privilege, sir.

     QUINN snorts, starts on his way, then turns back.

                    QUINN
          Sergeant?

                    M.J.
          Yessir.

                    QUINN
          You ever reflect how this big
          explosion in dead women coincides
          with the flowering of women's lib?

                    M.J.
          Yessir.  I have reflected on that,
          sir.  Which explains my gushing
          deference to you, sir.

     QUINN is somehow cheered by this little exchange.

                    QUINN
          Nikko's looking better by the
          minute, Inspector.

     He stomps off.

     INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

     HELEN on couch, ANDY is massaging her neck.

                    HELEN
          Oh, God.  I must have looked
          horrible.

                    ANDY
          No, dear.  You're at your best with
          a bag in front of your face.

                    HELEN
          I want to die.

                    ANDY
          I wouldn't.  He'll be back.  If you
          want him.  The cute brutal type
          with handcuffs.  Very sexy.

     HELEN grins, and ANDY starts to tickle her, she laughs.

                    ANDY
          You thought he was cute too, didn't
          you?  Admit... admit...

     HELEN now laughing a little too hard.  Suddenly the laughter
     changes to tears.

                    ANDY
          What?  What'd I do?

                    HELEN
          Reminded me that I used to be
          attractive.  That men used to want
          me...

                    ANDY
          You slut!  No sexy young cop for
          you unless you shampoo your hair.

     She clings desperately to him.  He rocks her as he would a
     small child.

                    ANDY
          When are you going to call them?

                    HELEN
               (big beat)
          About what?

     ANDY PRODUCES THE FILE M.J. LEFT WITH HIM.  Helen looks at
     it.  Andy watches her...

                    HELEN
          I can't, Andy.

                    ANDY
          Then, why don't you just die.  I'm
          going.  They'll find your body
          years later, the old recluse lady,
          she ate cat food, ten years of the
          New York Times, unread, piled on
          top of the unread mail, the TV
          still on.  Make up your mind.  Live
          or die.
               (beat)
          I'll get coffee.

     He exits.  After a moment fighting her fears, Helen reaches
     for the file.  She opens it and looks at the first picture.
     THE PHONE RINGS.  She freezes... Panic hangs in the air...
     Andy answers the phone in the kitchen...

                    ANDY (O.S.)
          Yes?  Inspector Halloran, she's
          going through the material now.
               (beat)
          She'll call you... No, she'll be
          alright, I'll sleep over on the
          couch in case.  But now, I told
          you, singing like a lark.

     Hangs up.  After a moment Helen bends to her work...

     Slew police bodyguard in attack on expert witness

     M.J. hears NIKKO entering, looks up, gives him a half-smile,
     returns her attention to the microfilm.

                    NIKKO
          Working late.
               (no response)
          You're a damn fool.

                    NIKKO
          You're almost ten years older than
          he is.

     M.J. turns off the microfilm.  The last headline is retained
     on screen:

     "ESCAPE KILLER CLAIMS NEW VICTIM"

                    NIKKO
          It's none of my business anymore...

          none of your business.

                    NIKKO
          You're shitting ion your career.  You
          outrank hi...

     M.J. looks at him at last with wry amusement: he's jealous 
     of Ruben?
     
                    M.J.
          Well, you outranked me, Nikko.

                    NIKKO
          Yeah.  And you used that. Used me

                    M.J.
          Don't put yourself down like that.
          I never used you.  I worked my way
          up like a marine grunt!

                    NIKKO
          Yeah, you did that too.  You earned
          what you got; don't shit on it,
          that's all I'm saying.

                    M.J.
               (maddeningly)
          God, you're cute when you're mad.

     The door opens and RUBEN enters, instantly takes in the
     scene:  M.J. sitting in front of a stalled machine, NIKKO,
     looming over her.  After an awkward beat, NIKKO heads for
     the door.  Ignoring RUBEN, he barks at M.J.

                    NIKKO
          Think about it.

     RUBEN regards M.J., who busies herself examining the other
     tapes.

                    RUBEN
          What's wrong with him?

                    M.J.
          He's just mad he let me keep the
          espresso machine.  We heard from
          Doctor Hudson?

                    RUBEN
          Nada.  Lemme make the call.

                    M.J.
          Honest to God, Ruben!

                    RUBEN

     kneels on the grass, weeding a lush flowerbed.  The CAMERA
     SWISHHPANS TO the back door of the house as a man comes out

     INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY

     CLOSE UP:  early crime scene photos.

     WE SEE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FIRST TWO MURDER VICTIMS, SO
     WE SEE THE PATTERN HELEN DESCRIBES AND ANALYZES.

                    HELEN (V.O.)
          The way he's posed the bodies...
          he's flaunting his power to do
          whatever he wants to her.  This
          man... He probably seems perfectly
          normal.  These murders are organized
          and planned.

     WE ARE NOW SEEING THE ROOM:  M.J. AND RUBEN, HELEN AT A TABLE
     IN HER OFFICE LAYING OUT THE PICTURES.  Helen picks out one
     picture from the rest...

                    HELEN
          Except for this one.  You put that
          one in to test me.

     M.J. nods, pleased with HELEN>

     INSERT: THE PICTURE.  The victim's body is covered with
     bruises.  But, unlike the others, her face has been covered.

                    HELEN (V.O.)
          Is it an ongoing case?

     BACK TO SCENE...

                    M.J.
               (nods)
          For months... last October.

                    HELEN
          It was a lover or a husband.
          Someone close.  Somebody who knew
          her and cared about her.

                    M.J.
               (glancing at Ruben)
          How do you know that?

                    HELEN
          He felt remorse.  He covered her.

     HELEN arranges and rearranges photos like tarot cards.

                    HELEN
          The bodies have been carefully
          arranged... different positions,
          but somehow the same.  The
          positions are brutal... yet
          quite... artful.  It's like... a
          signature.  He's proud of his
          accomplishments.  There are early
          Picassos and late Picassos, but you
          always recognize the hand.  He
          wants us to recognize his hand.
          I've seen this hand before... what
          are you hiding?

                    M.J.
               (taken aback)
          Nothing.

                    HELEN
          Where are the stockings he
          strangled them with?

                    M.J.
          How did you know they were
          stockings?

                    HELEN
               (sarcastic)
          I sent Andy out on murder missions.
          For God's sake -- it's the Boston
          Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used
          their own stockings to strangle
          them.  Tied in a bow-knot.

     She gets down a file from her bookcase and flops it open to
     pictures of deSalvo's victims:  they are identical...

                    HELEN
          Somebody is imitating his m.o.
          Look for a plumber or carpenter or
          handyman; that's how deSalvo got in
          the door and caught them off guard.

                    RUBEN
          The Boston Strangler, when was
          that...?

                    HELEN
          In the sixties.  He's dead --
          stabbed to death in prison.

                    M.J.
          Why imitate a dead serial killer?

                    HELEN
          If you knew why, you might know
          where to look for him.
          I don't envy you this; he's not
          done -- he's going to do them faster
          and faster to keep the adrenaline
          rush.  Now, I've done what you 
          asked me.

                    M.J.
          Work with me.

                    ANDY (O.S.)
          It's good for you.

     They are startled by his appearance!  A little unsettling.

                    ANDY
          It's good medicine.

                    RUBEN
          A little homeopathic cure for the
          willies.

                    HELEN
               (exhausted)
          None of you know anything about it.
          Now go.  And Andy, if you persist
          in playing doctor, leave, with
          them.

          I'm the only friend you've got,
          darling, and I don't intend to stop
          doing what I think is good for us.

                    HELEN
          Get out!  All of you!

     Andy helps M.J. and Ruben scoop up the files...

                    RUBEN
          You said you don't give a fuck and

          wearing green.  Checking out
          psychiatric hospitals for his
          personality profile.  Cross check-
          ing names from arrests for sexual
          offenses, public fondling.  If
          they've got a German wife.  We can
          keep cops working on this kind of
          junk for years, and this guy's

          information?

                    QUINN

          boyfriend so the bastard spends the

          a lesson.  We'll get a shitload of

     HELEN sits at side-by-side computers.  The chess game is
     again in progress.

     HELEN makes a move.  Pleased with herself, she smiles,
     types, "I'm creaming you."

     Suddenly over HELEN'S shoulder, the other screen becomes
     active, we see 'Message for Helen Hudson.'

     Engrossed in her own chess game, she does not notice the
     screen until, tense from sitting too long, with waiting for
     CHESSMASTER'S move, HELEN begins to stretch her neck and
     toll her head.  Now, out of the corner of her eye, she sees
     the other screen.  Quickly, she clicks on this, and the
     screen prints out 'A GAME FOR DR. HUDSON PLEASE RUN THIS
     "TOMORROW.AVI" FILE ON YOUR PLAYER.'

     HELEN TYPES 'WIN' AND WINDOWS SCREEN COMES UP.  WITH THE
     MOUSE SHE CLICKS ON THE AVI PLAYER ICON, TYPES IN

     from a breast of the other.  Two heads.  One, properly on
     its own neck, the other emerging from between two legs.
     Hands, feet, breasts, hair of two bodies mixed mischievously

     INT. HELEN'S OFFICE

     The computer glow, the unfinished chess game still up, and
     the RED-HEADED WOMAN'S joyful face on the other.  HELEN SITS
     IN A CHAIR WITH HER BACK TO THE SCREEN, ROCKING BACK AND
     FORTH, suppressing her fear by sheer will.  M.J. and Ruben
     enter with Andy...  they look at the face on the computer
     screen... (this is the only light in the room).

                    HELEN
          That's the face of the next one
          he'll kill.

     She hasn't looked at them or the computer... SHE ROCKS...

                    M.J.
          How do you know that?

                    HELEN
               (can't look at it)
          Look at the bottom of the screen.
          You see the icon with the arrow
          pointing left?  Click on that...
          twice.

     RUBEN (FROM A MISSPENT YOUTH IN VIDEO ARCADES) expertly
     maneuvers the mouse and clicks on the icon as instructed.
     NOW THE ANIMATED COLLAGE PLAYS BACKWARD!  IN TENTH OF A
     SECOND STEPS WE SEE THE IMAGE OF THE RED-HEADED WOMAN MERGE
     BACKWARD THROUGH THE DISTORTED IMAGES AND BECOME

     THE DEAD WOMAN IN THE BATHTUB.

     M.J. AND RUBEN REACTING, LIGHTED BY THE GLOW FROM THE SCREEN.

                    M.J.
          How did you do that?

                    HELEN
          That computer's wired into
          INTERNET.

                    RUBEN
          He's hacked into her Internet
          address.  He's a hacker.

                    HELEN
               (rocking, rocking)
          He can get into my computer any
          time he likes!  This is exactly the
          kind of thing I didn't want to have
          happen.

                    M.J.
          Can you make a copy we can show on
          our computers?

                    HELEN
          It's too big a file to copy to a
          disk.

                    RUBEN
          You got a tape backup, yeah, here
          lemme copy it on tape...

                    M.J.
          Why would he send this to Helen
          Hudson...

                    HELEN
          It's a game they like to play.
          Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung
          around the crime scene, talking to
          the cops.  This one's probably
          watching you, laughing at you.

                    RUBEN
          Let me get a little action started
          here.

     M.J. nods to him to get along... He calls on his cellular
     phone while simultaneously working the computer...

                    M.J.
          I'm going to put a guard on your
          door.

                    HELEN
          One officer already got killed
          trying to protect me.  Please, just
          take it all away.  Leave me alone.

                    M.J.
          He won't.

                    RUBEN
          Look at this...

     THE COMPUTER SCREEN HAS A LEGEND ON IT:
     NOW YOU SEE ME...

     As they watch, it is replaced by:

     NOW YOU DON'T...

     AND THEN IT FADES TO BLACK...  Helen goes to the machine and
     maneuvers with mouse and keyboard.

                    HELEN
          It's gone.  The file's not here.
               (to Ruben)
          What did you do?

                    RUBEN
          I just started it copying to tape,
          but the tape never ran.  It just
          did that...

                    HELEN
               (respect)
          He's brilliant.  This one is
          brilliant.

                    M.J.
          We'll show that to...

                    HELEN
          Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a
          self destruct virus into the code,
          so it would only play until we try
          to copy it.  Then it erased itself.
          Gone...
               (beat)
          Do you remember what you saw?

     INT. POLICE HQ CORRIDOR - DAY

     M.J., RUBEN, QUINN, MAYBE OTHERS OF HIS STAFF STRIDE
     PURPOSEFULLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR, CAMERA MOVING WITH THEM...
     For a moment we won't know who Quinn is talking about...

                    QUINN
          He's on the phone calling me like an
          insurance salesman soliciting my
          business, for Christ's sake.  I
          didn't tell him the three most
          over-rated things in life are young
          pussy, regular exercise and the
          F.B.I.

                    M.J.
          Oh, maaaaan?!

                    QUINN
          What?  I talk like a cop, this is
          the way I talk.  I can't believe
          this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy
          Assistant Director of the F.B.I.
          "Let me help you!"

                    M.J.
          We could use a little help.

                    QUINN
          With the F.B.I. there's no such
          thing as a little help.  They bury
          you with help.  Explain to me about
          this virus, no don't tell me about
          the virus.  Thing is, you saw it,
          the pictures.

     They pass through a door into a ROOM where the homicide team
     sit waiting... M.J. goes right into a briefing...

                    M.J.
          We saw it.  The unknown target is
          kneeling, she's gardening.  Red
          hair, high cheekbones, mid-
          thirties, height I don't know,
          she's not overweight, she's
          zofting... She's in front of a
          house that looks like...

     EXT. MARINA HOUSE - LATE DAY

     As she is speaking, her description becomes V.O. as we SEE
     police cars and an ambulance drawn up IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE
     SHE IS DESCRIBING...

                    M.J. (V.O.)
          ... the Marina area, there was
          earthquake damage repair on the
          house it looked like, a little
          garden.  The light was late
          afternoon.  Say about cocktail
          hour.  He was bringing out drinks,
          margaritas by the look.  So we got
          a house facing west, on the east
          side of the street.  Full sun, so
          there's no high trees or buildings,
          residential both sides.

     SUSAN SCHIFFER and her crew arrive, leaping out of their van
     with their equipment, a makeup woman ADJUSTING SUSAN'S
     MAKEUP AND HAIR RIGHT THERE IN THE STREET...

     INT. MARINA HOUSE - DAY

     M.J. and Ruben, Quinn, etc., trying to calm and/or question
     the HUSBAND, who is in shock.  He is the man we saw bringing
     drinks.

                    HUSBAND
          Stupid goddam s-stupid p-poker
          game!  Always have to s-stay until
          Phil makes a c...comeback.  Am I
          stuttering?

     The husband's voice follows QUINN and others as another COP
     leads them toward the back of house.

     DOOR TO BEDROOM.  QUINN AND RUBEN have stopped just inside
     door.  M.J. forced to peer around them.

     M.J.'S POV: On the bed, the RED-HEADED WOMAN'S body is
     propped up against the headboard, her knees up, her head
     fallen onto a shoulder: her pajama top has been ripped open
     and pushed up.  Knotted around her neck is a pink scarf tied
     in a huge bow under her chin.  On her feet, secured between
     her toes, is a commercial flyer advertising the Festival of
     Love.  It is brightly printed with red hearts.  It has been
     hand-lettered:

     HELL IN THE FESTIVAL OF LOVE

     EXT. FESTIVAL OF LOVE IN GOLDEN STATE PARK - NIGHT

     CAMCORDER capturing the audience of a ROCK CONCERT in full
     blast, in GOLDEN GATE PARK.  The audience, mostly young,
     some in 70's costume, sit and loll around on blankets.  Most
     seem to have some variety of refreshment... liquid or rolled.
     The CAMERA records the unsteady progress of a lovely YOUNG
     GIRL, weaving her way through the blankets and the bodies.
     She suddenly becomes aware of the camera being aimed at her.
     She stops, strikes a comically seductive pose and gives a
     big, gorgeous smile.  FREEZE FRAME.

     ANDY answers the door.  M.J. and Ruben...

                    ANDY
          She just got to sleep.  Do you have
          to tell her about it now?

                    M.J.
          Tell her about what?

                    ANDY
               (mock admiration)
          Gaahhd!  What a cop!  You busted
          me!
               (real)
          The new one, in the Marina.
               (to their reaction)
          She has a police radio scanner.
          It's always on.  She turns it off,
          and then she has to turn it on
          again.  She's obsessed.  She can't
          not listen to it, but she can't
          listen to it, so she makes me
          listen to it.

     HELEN APPEARS IN WHATEVER SHE SLEEPS IN.

                    HELEN
          I am not going to look at any more
          pictures.  They're like a disease.
          They get into my head.  I can't get
          them out.

                    M.J.
          I don't look at pictures.  I look
          at the real thing.  I don't feel
          infected.

                    HELEN
          Maybe that's why you can't catch
          him.  I know what she looks like --
          the red-headed woman in my
          computer.

                    M.J.
          I just came from her... here's what
          you haven't seen.

     M.J. takes out a picture of the dead RED-HEADED WOMAN.  Her
     manner is that of cop with a witness.

                    M.J. (cont'd)
          A forgery of the Mary Sullivan
          murder scene, he's done it perfect.
          Except for the sign.

                    HELEN
               (looking at photo)
          She probably let him in the door
          without a thought.  Where are their
          mothers?!  Where are the mothers
          that are supposed to teach them to
          be wary and to tough and not afraid
          to fight?

                    M.J.
          Look at the sign.  'Hell'?  In the
          Festival of Love?  You make any
          sense in that?

     HELEN stares at the picture.

                    M.J. (cont'd)
          For 'Hell', read 'Helen'.  He's
          talking to you.

                    HELEN
          It's anybody connected to author-
          ity.  They write, they even knock
          on your door.  They're fans.  It
          thrills them to flirt with getting
          caught.

                    M.J.
          Nobody knows you have anything to
          do with this case; nothing has been
          on TV or the news... Why would he
          want to get in your computer?

                    HELEN
          Because I'm his damned pin-up girl!
          His, all of them!  They know me.
          They're in prisons with libraries,
          they collect clippings, I'm their
          worthy opponent.  You keep my name
          out of this.

                    RUBEN
          Absolutely.

                    M.J.
          My promise.

     Andy, who has ducked out, now reappears, dressed for a date.

                    ANDY
          The moon is up, my night to howl.
          Will you be okay?

                    HELEN
          Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You
          go.  Poor thing, you ought to get
          out.

                    ANDY
               (to M.J.)
          Look out for her.  She's tougher
          than you think.

     He goes...

                    HELEN
          I know 'Halloran.'  What's the rest
          of it?

                    RUBEN
          MaryJane.  We call her M.J.

                    HELEN
          MaryJane.  You think that logic and
          police procedure, order and science
          and method will hold back the
          horrors of a world gone mad and the
          sickness of the night.  I did once.
          But you know how he'll get caught?
          He'll have an accident, or some cop
          will get lucky.  You can't catch
          him by being intelligent and
          working hard.  Or the worst:  there
          are dozens of women slaughtered in
          the most horrible way, month after
          month.  The news stories grow more
          grotesque and bizarre and in the
          city people lock their doors and
          windows, and hurry home before
          dark.  And then, one day, there are
          no more.  What happened?  Did he
          just stop?  Get tired and disgusted
          and decide not to kill any more?
          Did he kill himself?  Did he die in
          an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or
          get sick and die?  It's like the
          murderer walked off the edge of the
          earth.  And you never know.  But
          you keep asking yourself -- when you
          read about a new murder -- is he
          back?

     M.J. stands.  She has noted Ruben's reaction to Helen's
     story.  There is an edge of sarcasm in her voice...

                    M.J.
          That's amazing.  A whole new book,
          thought up in a minute.  Very good.
               (beat)
          All I know how t do is get up,
          take a shower, and go to work.
          Hope, if he does another I'll nail
          the son of bitch, and they'll spell
          my name right in the newspaper.
          Where is Andy going?

                    HELEN
          He's going home.  He slept over
          because I was a little anxious...

                    M.J.
          I want a guard on you.  I'm worried
          about leaving you alone.

                    RUBEN
               (to M.J.)
          We're through for the night, aren't
          we?  You go on.  Get some sleep.
          I'll stay until we can get a man
          out here and maybe catch a cab
          home.

                    HELEN
          That would be much appreciated.
          Thanks.

                    M.J.
               (to Helen)
          Somewhere down the line we're doing
          to find a connection between him
          and you.  I want you to worry that
          idea like a loose tooth.

     Three voices chime self-conscious 'Good-nights.'

     The drapes swing open.  RUBEN CAN BE SEEN DOING SOMETHING AT
     THE WINDOWS... The Camcorder zooms to a close-up of M.J.
     She gets into her car and speeds off.

     INT. HELEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Ruben is checking the windows...

                    RUBEN
          You ought to get some decent locks
          on these.  A six-year-old could get
          in here.  Much less a motivated
          man.

     At the phrase 'motivated man', HELEN looks at him boldly in the
     eye.
                      HELEN
          You and MaryJane aren't lovers.

                    RUBEN
          Not yet.

     HELEN laughs.  So does RUBEN.  Her boldness, her laughter,
     attracts him.  His honesty attracts HELEN.  He feels the
     heat.

                    HELEN
          Are you always so bold?

                    RUBEN
          No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.

     His grin says he'd select her anytime...

                    RUBEN
          The problem for me is... you're in
          the witness category.
               (beat -- Jack
                Nicholson)
          Know what I mean?

                    HELEN
          Well.  Another time, then.
               (beat)
          I'll be all right.  He's not going
          to attack me; what I' m rally
          afraid of is all in my own head,
          Ruben.

     They smile ruefully at one another, and without further
     conversation, leave the bedroom.

          I know you have the idea, but it'll
          make me feel a lot better.

     She smiles, and RUBEN turns, walks away.  She stays in the
     doorway watching his retreat.  About ten feet away, he
     suddenly stops.

                    RUBEN
          Hey!

     He turns around, she is still in the doorway.  He reaches
     for his wallet, withdraws a card, holds it up to her.

                    RUBEN
          The number for my cellular.

                    RUBEN
          Don't hesitate.  Anytime.  Night or
          day.  I mean that.

     He hods card out to her.  HELEN, holding onto the door
     frame, doesn't move.  RUBEN continues to extend his hand
     with the card in it.  It is a charged moment.  She is frozen
     in the doorway; RUBEN refuses to make a move towards her.
     HELEN summons all her nerve and lets go of the door frame,
     determined not to have any further mortification this night,
     she takes one shaky step out into the hallway to meet him.
     Then a second step and a third.

     Her hand touches the card, takes it.

     She turns her head to gauge the distance she must retreat.
     What she sees is that the door's Sureclose device has
     quietly and efficiently closed.  The door is locked.
     Frantic, she turns back toward RUBEN.

     HER POV:

     RUBEN, now seems a vast distance away from her.  He is just
     turning down the stairs and is gone... The hallway first
     narrows, squeezing her in, then expands.  She is lost in the
     miles and miles of space between the two walls.

                    HELEN
          Oh, God!  Help me!

     RUBEN reappears, races toward her...

                    RUBEN
          Tell me what to do!

                    HELEN
          I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!

     She starts to pass out, to sink to her knees, but RUBEN
     catches her, puts her up against the wall, handling her like
     a suspect.  He puts one hand on the back of her neck,
     spreads her legs, gets her in frisk position.  Somehow, this
     is comforting to her, but she is still in full-blown
     panic...

                    HELEN
          ...falling... FALLING!

     He pressed his body up against hers, his weight anchoring
     her against the feeling of free-fall.

                    RUBEN
          I'm right here.  I won't let you
          fall.

     He still has a hand on the back of her neck.  Suddenly, the
     proximity effects him, makes him want to kiss her neck.  She
     begins to hyperventilate.

                    HELEN
          Don't let go... I can't breathe...
          I'll die!

                    RUBEN
          Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe.
          I'll fix it...

     RUBEN takes out his gun...

                    RUBEN
          Put your hands over your ears.

     RUBEN shoots off the lock.  Then he picks HELEN up and
     carries her back into her apartment.

     INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     RUBEN enters and puts HELEN down on the couch, pulls a throw
     up over her.  He sees her Xanax bottle on a table, hands it
     to her.  She takes out three as he pours her some seltzer
     water, then watches her take the pills.  After which he
     takes the bottle and pockets it.

                    HELEN
          The lock...

                    RUBEN
          I'll get a locksmith.

                    HELEN
          Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid
          to sleep... I don't want...him...in
          my head...

     RUBEN pulls a big chair up beside the sofa.  As her eyes
     close, RUBEN comforts her.  TV features the antics of a
     nervous little prairie dog family.  He looks back at HELEN.

     CLOSE UP HELEN:

     We hear a faint but impatient voice call:

                    V.O.
          Peter... Peter...

                                   CROSS FADE TO:

     INT. BEDROOM (DALY CITY) - NIGHT

     Dim light.  The room is unattractive, over-furnished but not
     comfortably.  A WOMAN is sitting propped up in a double bed.
     She is in her mid-thirties, but drained and pale, she looks
     older.  A chronic invalid.  By her side is a NASTY LITTLE
     DOG, with ribbon bows in its fur.  Near the bed is a TV and
     video, on which a movie's final credits are running.

     THE WOMAN IS IMPATIENTLY PUSHING AN INTERCOM BUTTON

     PETER enters.  Younger than the woman, rather good-looking.
     Boyish and nondescript except for a patch of white skin near
     his hairline.  AN OLD SCAR.  He goes straight to TV and puts
     the tape on 'eject.'

                    WOMAN
          Put in the Kevin Costner.

                    PETER
          Why don't we save it for later?
          It's almost time for Letterman.

                    WOMAN
          You know I don't like to watch talk
          shows by myself.  Where're you?

     He inserts the video she wants and pushes 'play.'  Then he
     approaches the bed, leans over his wife and gently pushes a
     lock of hair back from the forehead.

     She ignores him, staring at the screen.  The NASTY LITTLE
     DOG BARES ITS TEETH AND SNAPS AT HIM.

                    WOMAN
          See, now you've annoyed her.  You
          know she doesn't like you to touch
          me.
               (to dog)
          Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve
          you so much!
               (to Peter)
          Did you feed her?

                    PETER
          Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's
          hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.

                    WOMAN
          She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed
          her?

                    PETER
          She lies all the time.  Why would I
          say I fed her if I didn't?

                    WOMAN
          That's what I don't know.  Why
          would you lie?  That's the
          problem... I can't understand why
          anyone would lie.

     He leaves.  As he goes we can hear the Woman still talking
     to her dog over the TV soundtrack.

                    WOMAN (cont'd)
          You wouldn't lie to Mummy, would
          you?  Just to get Dad in trouble?
          Such a naughty widdle dog...

     HER VOICE FADES AWAY AS WE FOLLOW HIM down the stairs into a
     small, ill-lit and dreary living room, into a messy kitchen,
     then through a door leading to the basement.  He locks the
     basement door behind him.

     THE BASEMENT is brightly lighted, full of high tech, gadgets
     and computers.  As he approaches the bottom stair, we see a
     small TV/video set attached to a wall.  On its screen,
     freeze-framed and silent, is a video of a PRETTY GIRL at an
     outdoor rock concert, smiling seductively.

     PETER puts on a WHITE LAB COAT and then reaches over
     something to turn the video back on.

     The CAMERA PANS DOWN to what he has leaned across.  It is
     the YOUNG GIRL from the concert.  She is strapped onto a
     table, her mouth taped shut.  A plastic bag covers her head,
     but not tightly.  She is semiconscious.  She is being
     asphyxiated by slow degrees.

     PETER looks at her, gently pushes the bag up far enough to
     repeat the tender gesture with her damp hair that he made
     toward his wife.  He whispers:

                    PETER
          Didn't I promise I'd come right
          back?

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. HILLSIDE - DAWN

     ALL NIGHT FESTIVAL REVELLERS dance across the skyline, of
     glorious misty green hills, hand in hand.  The Camera moves
     down, across verdant meadows, until we arrive at the bottom
     of the nearest hill which slopes finally to a highway.  A
     few festival up-all-night REVELERS, looking down at a new
     CRIME SCENE, where three blue-and-whites are parked, plus a
     number of unmarked cars.

     RUBEN ARRIVES IN A TAXI.

     As he moves past the ever-present SUSAN we THREAD THROUGH
     THE SCENE TO FIND M.J.  M.J. takes one look at RUBEN'S
     stubble, his yesterday's slept-in clothes, and she turns
     away.  Before RUBEN can catch up with her, NIKKO approaches.

                    RUBEN
          Up all night with a sick friend.

     NIKKO'S face is tight with anger.

                    NIKKO
          You dumb son of a bitch!  You don't
          even know how to treat a woman.

                    RUBEN
          Who?  M.J.?  Hey, Nikko, explain to
          me why she gave you the boot...

     He moves to M.J. who stands beside the dead BODY OF THE
     WOMAN WE LAST SAW STRAPPED TO A TABLE.  The plastic bag is
     now tied tight around her neck.  She has been posed beneath
     a sign that says "NO DUMPING".  The usual technicians,
     photographers, Doc, the Coroner, etc.

                    RUBEN
          Is Niccoletti assigned here?

                    M.J.
               (angry about it)
          Quinn decided we should form a task
          force -- they're all one case, now.
          He wants all the senior detectives
          on it...
               (to Doc)
          She wasn't killed here.

                    DOC
          Not likely.

     M.J. is kneeling, inspecting everything here; Ruben kneels
     beside her... to Ruben...

                    M.J.
          Tell me what you see.

     He inspects the dead girl's fingernails.

                    RUBEN
          She didn't fight back, no hair or
          skin under her fingernails.  I'm
          not seeing any bruises or
          contusions...

                    M.J.
          What about her arms?

                    RUBEN
          Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at
          this...

     Nikko appears, looming over her...

                    NIKKO
          Probably so stoned she never knew
          what got her.  Like Goetz's sick
          friend.  Right Goetz?

     They ignore him.  M.J. stands...

                    RUBEN
          She's blue as hell.  No marks on her
          neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same --
          no ligature marks.  Outdoors...

                    M.J.
          Look at her legs.

                    RUBEN
          Spread out like she was sexually
          assaulted here.

                    DOC
          After she was dead.

                    RUBEN
          She was dragged up here from the
          road, you can see the tracks.  She
          was already dead or unconscious.
          Let's get plaster casts on any --
          all footprints.

                    M.J.
          If this is just the dump site,
          where did he do the job?  Where did
          he pick her up?

                    NIKKO
          Doped up kids all over town.  Park
          was full of them last night.  Very
          easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.

     Ruben hits him, Nikko reflexively throws a punch that grazes
     Ruben.  Everybody stops in astonishment.  M.J. steps between
     them.  Ready to get physical herself; they settle...

                    M.J.
          What the hell are you doing?  The
          Mouth and the Haircut are right
          down there, thank God they didn't
          see that.

     Down below, Susan and the Haircut are interviewing Festival-
     of-Lovers.

                    M.J.
          Niccoletti, they're on the wrong
          side of the tape, you want to push
          them back?  Now.

     Nikko trots off to Susan and the Haircut.  M.J. gestures for
     RUBEN, now on his feet and dabbing at a split lip, to follow
     her back to the cars.  As they move more slowly down the
     hillside to their cars...

                    M.J.
          Ruben, my God, I ought to put you
          on report.

                    RUBEN
          You're right.  I can't stand that
          bastard.  Sorry.
               (getting back to
                work)
          This is something new.  Not the
          same guy, that's for sure.

                    M.J.
          Yeah, everything's different.

     But she seems unhappy... to techs standing by:

                    M.J.
          Get the pictures, and casts of
          footprints.

                    RUBEN
          Look at him, grandstanding...

     Nikko is talking to Susan Schiff...

                    M.J.
          That's all we need...

     She strides toward them...

                    M.J.
          Detective Niccoletti?

                    SUSAN
          What's this about the Boston
          Strangler, M.J.?

     M.J. looks at Nikko.  He should know better.  She's also
     thinking: is this a good thing to have the media announce at
     this point -- or not?

                    M.J.
          Hey, Susan -- I'm sorry, you're on
          the wrong side of the tape.  We're
          still trying to find any footprints
          or tire marks and we don't want to
          chew up the ground, okay?  I'll
          talk to you later.
               (to Nikko)
          You, too.

     She's got Susan outside the tape...

                    SUSAN
          Inspector, will you confirm
          somebody is copying the Boston
          Strangler?  This is the fourth, is
          that correct?

                    M.J.
          We're going to review all the
          evidence carefully before making
          any statement...

     She is getting into her car; Ruben jumps in on the other
     side.  Susan races for her silver Audi...

                    M.J.
          Ruben, put the light on...

     From outside the car as they drive away we see Ruben's arm
     clap the magnetic flasher on the top of their unmarked car.

     M.J. switches it on... A CHASE ENSUES.  SUSAN has a faster
     car, but M.J. is a better driver.  Stomach dropping hills,
     trolley cars, the corkscrew turns of Lombard Street, all the
     familiar San Francisco chase scenes.

                    M.J.
          Now listen up, Ruben.  You never,
          never, never mess with somebody
          inside the case!

                    RUBEN
          Excuse me?  Excuse me?!  What do
          you...

                    M.J.
          You damn well better start working
          on that impulse control.  A woman
          who is implicated in this case?
          Someone who's practically a piece
          of evidence?

                    RUBEN
          It's against your rules that I try
          to help a witness who's scared
          shitless?  Who's...

                    M.J.
          The woman's unstable.  You could
          wind up with a harassment charge.
          Anything.  You're like some horny
          little teenager.

     M.J. takes another two-wheel corner.  In the rear view
     mirror, M.J. watches SUSAN lose control of her car as she
     tries to make a tight turn, M.J. smiles in contempt.

                    M.J.
          Anybody who's ever watched TV knows
          about that corner.

     Having lost SUSAN, M.J. slows down to a normal speed.

                    M.J.
          Everybody could see you -- unshaved,
          same clothes from yesterday,
          reeking of sex.

     RUBEN'S eye-brows lift.  She peels into the HQ parking lot
     and jumps out.

                    M.J.
               (going away)
          Park the car.  Call the lab.  Get
          Doc to lean on the coroner for a
          really fast prelim on the sperm.

     RUBEN gets out of the car to cross to the driver's side...

                    M.J. (O.S.)
          When you get it, call me.

     RUBEN look after her, a smile of delight on his face.

                    RUBEN
          She loves me.

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. QUINN'S OFFICE - DAY

     QUINN, NICCOLETTI.

                    QUINN
          I know; the kid hit you first.  He
          already told me.

                    NIKKO
          He's not treating her right...

                    QUINN
          She left you, Nikko.  She's not
          your responsibility.  She takes
          very good care of herself.  If she
          wants to romance the kid, it ain't
          your business.  Your business is to
          snap out of it.

                    NIKKO
          We were together six years, sir!

                    QUINN
          Don't give me six years!  You never
          divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd
          you expect from M.J.?

                    NIKKO
          She knows I'm Catholic!  She never
          mentioned divorce!  Not once!

                    QUINN
          Then you shoulda known she wasn't
          buying.  She was just long-term
          leasing' you.
               (beat)
          Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare
          twenty-second twitch, there ain't
          nothin' about sex I don't hate.
          But of course, I'm Irish.
               (beat)
          Plus I got real problems.  I'm
          worried I might have to put you in
          over M.J.  There's something going on
          here, the Commissioner is targeting
          her now, I can't leave a woman in
          that position.  But the thing is,
          how can I move you in, if you go on
          acting like a teenage asshole?

                    NIKKO
          I don't want the job.  Don't do

          damned hard for it.

     INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY

     A ROOM IN THE BASEMENT OF THE POLICE HQ IS BEING SET UP TO
     HOUSE A NEW TASK FORCE, WITH CATERER'S TABLE FOR TEMP
     DESKS.  Bulletin boards with notices and pictures; telephone
     techs are still installing phones, cops are learning
     unfamiliar computer menus, etc.  M.J. IS EXAMINING HUGE
     BLOWUPS OF ONLOOKERS AT CRIME SCENES PINNED UP ON A WALL,
     WITH A MAGNIFYING LENS.

                    QUINN (V.O.)
          Sergeant...

     She walks away BECKONS, BECKONS, COME ON, WALK AFTER ME!  He
     walks out of a door and they stand on the steps...

     EXT. STEPS POLICE HQ - DAY

     A couple of Cops, maybe male and female, are smoking there.
     Quinn gives them a look that sends them scuttling inside,
     flipping their butts into the shrubbery.  Quinn sighs and
     digs out a cigarette.  The looks between them tell the story
     of his trying to give it up and not being able to, etc.

                    QUINN
          So what have we got?

                    M.J.
          It's not the same guy.  It should be
          a self-solver.  No bow around the
          neck, left and body outdoors,
          completely different.  The others
          were housewives, secretaries, he
          talked his way inside, killed them
          in their own living room or bed- or
          bathroom.  This one didn't have a
          husband or a boyfriend, no family,
          temp waitress, 3 arrests for
          misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI,
          asphyxiation probably from a
          plastic bag over her head.  Sexually
          assaulted.  The others weren't
          molested that way.  We're waiting
          for the sperm tests...

                    QUINN
          Christ.  How old are you?  You sure
          you want to be in this line of
          work?

                    M.J.
          You're damn right I do.

                    QUINN
          Okay, now what about your sidekick
          punching my favorite detective?
          What the hell is going on?  You got
          no discipline in your operation.

                    M.J.
          I'm sorry it had to come to your
          attention.  I am dealing with it.

     She starts to go...

                    QUINN
          Where you going?

                    M.J.
          Helen Hudson...

                    QUINN
          What the hell you need her for?

                    M.J.
          Because I think I'm wrong.

     INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

     CLOSE: XANAX BOTTLE.  SHAKING HANDS DUMP OUT PILLS.  FOUR.
     SIX.  TWO, PUT BACK.  ONE MORE, PUT BACK.

     HELEN: RAVAGED.  WATCHING HERSELF IN MIRROR AS SHE GULPS THE
     REMAINING PILLS.

     DOOR BELL RINGS O.S.

                    HELEN
          I'm not seeing anybody.

     We HEAR muffled voices -- ANDY and M.J.  HELEN, as she
     realizes Andy is letting M.J. in, goes to the bathroom door
     and tries to slam and lock it: Andy beats her to it,
     blocking with his foot in the door.

                    HELEN
          You're fired.

                    ANDY
          I know.  Do come and meet your
          guest.

     M.J. appears.  Taking in Helen's condition -- due to a wild
     night with Ruben?  Helen moves from the bathroom down the
     hall to her office, as...

                    M.J.
          We've got another one.

                    HELEN
          That's no surprise.

                    M.J.
          But it's a different m.o.

                    HELEN
          Then what do you need me for?

                    M.J.
          She was killed somewhere else and
     dumped outdoors in an empty lot.
          Where it says "no dumping."  Her
          legs pulled apart in a kind of
          sexual pose.   It's all different
          but it seems so -- the same.
          Artificial and posed... Something's
          wrong with it.

                    HELEN
          You're saying it's the same man,
          but he's changed his style?  That
          doesn't happen.  These men are
          robotic; the murder is like a
          ritual.  The method itself is part
          of the pleasure...

     They've turned into the office.  Something is wrong...

                    M.J.
          Who turned off the Internet
          computer...

                    HELEN
          I turned it off.  It's like an open
          window he can climb right in...

                    M.J.
          He comes in the window, we maybe
          grab him.  Where's the on-switch?

                    HELEN
          Have you got a warrant?  Get the
          hell out o here!  This is the
          only space I have left in the
          world!  Why can't you leave me out
          of it?

                    M.J.
          Helen -- the killer directly
          contacted you.  His interest in you
          is intense.  I'm worried about you.
          I don't want to lose you.  I know
          this stirs up every monster under
          the bed, but this is the only
          direct contact we have with him.
          The only chance we have to trap
          him.
               (beat)
          So, you can turn Internet back on,
          or I do, and we put somebody here
          on a 24 hour shift and you can
          kick, scream and hyperventilate.

                    HELEN
          That little Winona Ryder manner...
          you're more convincing as Clint
          Eastwood.

                    M.J.
          Clint is putting a guard on you.
          But if you swear to leave the
          computer on, Winona will assign him
          to the hall outside.

     HELEN has to laugh.  The laugh turns to a hacking cough.

                    ANDY
          She's smoking again.

     Andy leaves.  Helen sits, and with the care of someone
     handling a rattlesnake, turns the computer on.  Meanwhile...

     THE PHONE RINGS.

                    HELEN
          Hello?... Oh...
               (a beat)
          ...yes, she's right here.

     HELEN hangs the phone to M.J.  The air is a little more
     charged... Helen goes back to the computer.

                    HELEN
          Ruben.

                    M.J.
          Hello, Ruben...
               (listens, nods)
          So that's that...

                    HELEN
          Please thank Inspector Goetz for
          taking care of me last night.

     M.J. delivers the message straight-faced.

                    M.J.
          Ruben, Dr. Hudson wants me to
          thank you for taking care of her
          last night.
               (hangs up)
          Lab report on the new one.  At
          least two guys penetrated her.
          There were two kinds of sperm.  The
          poor thing.  What it must have been
          like.

     Helen has come alert...

                    HELEN
          She was near a sign that said "No
          Dumping?"  Two kinds of sperm --
          the lab said one was a secretor and
          the other was not?

     M.J. mumbles a surprised yes.  Helen is at computer.

                    HELEN
          There were needle marks.  But no
          drugs in her blood.

                    M.J.
          So far nothing they test for comes
          up positive.

     Helen has a Window type screen: she clicks icons...

                    HELEN
          Is that it?

                    M.J.
               (stunned)
          That's exactly... I could have
          taken that same picture, this
          morning.

     A RATHER GRAINY PICTURE OF A DEAD GIRL SPREAD OUT IN A
     SUGGESTIVE POSE IN AN EMPTY FIELD.  A SIGN RIGHT BY HER SAYS
     "NO DUMPING."

                    HELEN
          He's switched from DeSalvo to the
          Hillside Strangler.  The Strangler
          was two men, that's why there are
          two kinds of sperm.  His idea of a
          joke, very witty our boy.

                    M.J.
          That's not consistent... You said
          they never changed their style,
          they're robots...

                    HELEN
          Consistency is the hobgoblin of
          little minds.  Tell them to test
          for the chemicals found in Windex.
          That's a product for cleaning
          with...

                    M.J.
          I know Windex, for God's sake, I
          clean my own windows...

                    HELEN
          It's what Bianchi and Buono
          injected into one of their victims.

                    M.J.
               (sensing something
                appalling)
          Injected Windex!  Why would he
          switch to a new m.o.?

                    HELEN
          Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half
          way to nailing him.  Serial killing
          is irrational and rigid and 
          compulsive.  This guy has a plan
          all thought out, flexible and
          complex.  He's playing a game with
          us.  Who will he imitate next?
          Maybe he's doing all the serial
          killers in history, the great
          innovators, the murderers' hall of
          fame.  Just to prove he's better
          than all of them.  They got caught;
          he didn't.

                    M.J.
          He'll get caught.  If he has a plan
          that'll be what trips him up...

                    HELEN
          Who's going to catch him?  You?
               (beat)
          And if you do, there'll be another
          one.  And one after that.

                    M.J.
               (gently, surprised)
          You're afraid of him.

                    HELEN
          This one, yes.  I was always
          curious about these twisted little 
          souls, but this is the first one
          I've felt personally terrified of.
          He's something new and unheard of.
          I don't know what he wants.

                    M.J.
               (beat)
          I'm giving you Clint outside.

     The room is empty, the messy unmade bed has covers thrown
     back.  Nasty Little Dog is sprawled asleep on it.  The TV is
     on: SUSAN SCHIFFER'S broadcast... Over SUSAN'S shoulder, big

     INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     We see on HIS computer screen a picture of HELEN scanned
     from some newspaper or magazine.  PETER is building a morph:
     beside Helen on screen is another image -- of the RED-HEADED
     woman.  He is placing marks on one picture, on the exact
     corner of Helen's left eyes.  As he does so, a red dot
     appears near the corner of the left eye of the Red-headed
     woman.  Both pictures are dappled with similar dots.  It
     looks very odd, as though someone had stuck Post-its all
     over the images.  Around him, as he works are other pictures:
     ASPHYXIATED GIRL taken while she was strapped to the table.
     Of the sign "NO DUMPING."  M.J. leaving Helen's!  HE ALSO HAS

          a nickname around here -- "Deep

     EXT. HELEN'S STREET - NIGHT

     A MAN parks a car.  He gets out.  He is dressed entirely in
     black.  Glancing around to be sure he is not observed, the
     MAN moves to cars, banging them hard with his hand until he
     SETS OFF A CAR ALARM.  He trots silently to HELEN'S side of
     the street and merges into the dark side of her building.
     THE ALARM GOES INFURIATINGLY ON.  A light comes on in an

     BURT, the cop on guard, marginally irritated by the car

     EXT. RICHMOND DISTRICT - NIGHT

     CAR WHERE A WOMAN HAS BEEN SHOT DEAD.  KLIEG LIGHTS PAINT
     HER FEATURES A BLEAK WHITE ON BLACK.  M.J. and RUBEN work
     the scene along with the CRIME TECH CREW.

     One of the TECH GUYS holds up a bullet.

                    TECH GUY
          Pulled this out of the door, it's
          bigger than a .38; it's a .44 or 9
          millimeter.

     CLOSE: M.J. is crawling along the floor, looking at
     everything she can find -- gum wrappers, hobby pins, loose
     change, etc.  She lifts her head and finds the car radio and
     tape player right in her face.

                    M.J.
          Was this on?  When you found the
          car was the tape player on or off.

                    COP (V.O.)
          It was on, auto-reverse, over and
          over.

     M.J. has rubber gloves on.  She switches on ignition and the
     tape player starts:  ABBA.  A phone rings...

     ON RUBEN standing beside the car; he answers his phone...

                    RUBEN
          Yeah?... I can't talk now...
          What?... No.  There's no sexual

          in a car, it's not him.

                    HELEN
          She on the passenger side?

                    M.J.
               (shouting to be
                heard)
          Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on
          with his work...

                    HELEN
          What's that music.  It's Abba.  I
          can hear it.  It's Abba.

                    RUBEN
          What's Abba?

                    M.J.
          Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too
          young.

     Dread clouds HELEN'S face.  She is calling up databases,
     screens scrolling across her computer monitor.

                    HELEN
          Don't hang up!

                    RUBEN
          What?...

                    HELEN
          Listen to me.  Is there a gas
          station nearby?

     RUBEN look around, sees a gas station across the street and
     further down the block...

                    RUBEN
          Yes.

                    HELEN
          Is there a phone booth there?

                    RUBEN
          They all have one...

                    HELEN
          Go and look for a note.

     RUBEN hands the phone over to M.J.

                    RUBEN
          She wants me to check the phone
          booth for a note.

                    M.J.
          Helen... excuse me, we...

     ON HELEN'S SCREEN IS THE FACE OF BERKOWITZ... SHE CALLS UP
     ADDITIONAL FRAMES SHOWING SCENES OF HIS CRIMES.

                    HELEN
          She was listening to Abba in her
          parked car when she was shot with a
          Bulldog .44.

     M.J. reacts:  the scene of what Helen is saying hits her
     hard.  This is repeating the pattern of yet another
     killer...

                    M.J.
          Tony!

     The techie who pulled the bullet out of the door turns...

                    M.J.
          Let me see the slug outta the door!

     He pulls a baggie out his pocket and hands it to her...

     RUBEN RUNNING across to the gas station.  He's alone now,
     the blazing lights of the crime scene recede.

     EXT. HELEN'S BUILDING - NIGHT

     A small annoyed crowd has gathered around the are whose
     alarm is still shrieking.

     INT. HELEN'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

     BURT finally gets up, goes to window, sees situation,
     decides to go and fix it.

     EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

     M.J. still on phone to HELEN.  She's just got the bullet out
     of the baggie; Tony stands watching.

                    M.J.
          What's that siren?

                    HELEN (V.O.)
          One of those goddamned car alarms.
          What's going...

                    M.J.
          Ruben's gone to look... It's banged
          up but it looks like a .44.  It's
          Son of Sam.  Is it Son of Sam?

                    HELEN
          Look in the crowd.  He liked to
          hang around and watch the cops at
          work...

     EXT. SHELL STATION - NIGHT

     Closed.  RUBEN at the phone booth.

     A note lies on the shelf, handwritten in felt-tip pen.  He
     puts on a rubber glove, picks note up by one corner.

     CRIME SCENE:

     RUBEN has taken phone back from M.J.  He is reading the note
     to HELEN.  M.J., agitated, stands by.

                    RUBEN
          "Police: let me haunt you with
          these words:  I'll be back."

     M.J. notices that there is writing on the other side of the
     note.  She forces RUBEN'S gloved hand to turn note over.

                    RUBEN
          Hold on a minute, Helen...

     By this time M.J. has seen that this part is addressed to
     HELEN.  M.J. takes phone from RUBEN, forcing herself to
     sound casual.

                    M.J.
          Helen, Ruben's going to drop by.
          He's got some questions.

     She hangs up, RUBEN is already on his way.  M.J. calls a
     number...

                    M.J.
          Answer me!!...

     EXT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     The beeper on Burt's belt is beeping, but his head is under
     the hood of the car where the car alarm is blaring.  He
     can't hear the beeper...  

     BACK TO CRIME SCENE:

     M.J. ends the call, yells to another Detective.

                    M.J.
          I need a unit at 19809 Lorenda
          Drive.  Tell them to approach code
          2 and wait for instruction.  Find
          the goddamn officer supposed to be
          on security.  Ruben's on his way.
          He'll go in alone.

     SHE TURNS AND SEES:

     BEHIND YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE THE NIGHT IS FULL OF THRILL
     SEEKERS AND CURIOUS.  WHICH OF THEM MIGHT BE THE KILLER?
     THE GUY IN THE BACK OF THE CROWD WHO FOR NO APPARENT REASON
     SUDDENLY BEGINS TO RACE ALONG BEHIND THE ONLOOKERS?  THE MEN
     WHO DUCKS TO TIE HIS SHOE WHEN A PHOTOGRAPHER SHOOTS A
     PICTURE?

     INT. FRONT DOOR OF HELEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     The horn blares across the street, (O.S.).  No one notices
     the MAN at HELEN'S door, swiftly fiddling the lock with a
     ring full of burglars' keys and picks.

     INT. HELEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     HELEN is putting on makeup (Ruben is coming).  A small but
     alarming noise at the front of the loft.  She listens
     carefully, and moves to the door looking down the hall
     toward the front door.  It is OPEN"  Burt is not there!

     She hesitates a moment, then turns off the lights and
     sprints for the front door, to escape.

     INT. LIVING ROOM

     THE MAN IS PULLING A BALACLAVA UP OVER HIS FACE.  AS HE HEARS
     HER HE STEPS TO THE...

     INSERT: TELEPHONE

     A HAND IN A FINE LEATHER BLACK GLOVE LIFTS THE RECEIVER OFF
     THE HOOK.

     HELEN RUNS DOWN THE HALL AND REACHES THE FRONT DOOR.  SHE
     RUNS RIGHT OUT INTO THE HALL A FEW STEPS BEFORE RECOILING:

     HER POV.  THE WALLS AND FLOOR WEAVING AND CONTRACTING...
     AGORAPHOBIA HAS HIT.

     HELEN FALLS.  SHE SCRAMBLES IN TERROR BACK TO THE "SAFETY"
     OF HER WALL, NOW A CAVE OF DARKNESS.

     SHE FALLS ON THE FLOOR OF THE HALL, GASPING FOR BREATH.

     LIVING ROOM.  THE MAN MOVES ACROSS THE ROOM TOWARD THE
     HALL.

                                   CUT TO:

     RUBEN:  taking the hills fast.

     THE MAN: STEPS OUT INTO THE HALL.

     HELEN:  SHE HAS RUN BACK THE LENGTH OF THE HALL TO HER
     OFFICE.  SHE IS JUST VANISHING AS THE MAN STEPS TO WHERE HE
     CAN SEE HER.

     THE MAN STARTS TO FOLLOW, NOT FAST, BUT WITH TERRIFYING
     SURENESS...

     THE POLICE SCANNER SUDDENLY COMES UP LOUD.  HE HESITATES.

     HELEN:  HER REMOTE CONTROLS IN HAND SWITCHES ON TV SETS,
     LAMPS, ETC.

     THE MAN:  HE STARTS TO MOVE AGAIN, TOWARD WHERE HE BELIEVES
     SHE IS.  HE IS PASSING A WINDOW, WHEN THE CURTAINS SUDDENLY
     DRAW, RIGHT BESIDE HIM.  HE PAUSES AGAIN, LOOKS DOWN AND WE
     AND HE/WE SEE THE STREET SCENE: BURT AND NEIGHBORS TRYING TO
     SILENCE THE CAR ALARM.  THEN HE STARTS TO MOVE AGAIN.

     THE CURTAINS CLOSE.

     HIGH ANGLE OVER THE MAZE OF THE APARTMENT WALLS.  WE CAN SEE
     THE MAN MOVING ALONG THE HALLWAY AGAIN -- TOWARD ANDY'S DEN,
     AND DIRECTLY TOWARD WHERE WE LAST SAW HELEN.

     SUDDENLY, FOREGROUND, HELEN'S HEAD POPS UP, HUGE!  SHE IS
     WRESTLING HERSELF UP OVER THE WALL TOWARD CAMERA, INTO
     ANOTHER ROOM OUT OF HIS PATH.  WE PAN WITH HER AS SHE WIGGLES
     HERSELF OVER THE TOP OF THE WALL AND UNTIL SHE FALLS INTO
     FURNITURE, MAKING A HUGE NOISE.

     MAN STOPS, TRYING TO LOCATE DIRECTION.  HE DECIDES.  LEAPS
     WITH CATLIKE GRACE ONTO A PIECE OF FURNITURE AND FROM THERE
     ONTO THE TOP OF THE WALL!

     NOW HE STANDS ON THE PARTITION, LOOKING AROUND AT THE
     GROUNDPLAN (AS IT WERE) OF THIS APARTMENT MAZE FROM A HIGH
     ANGLE POV.

     HELEN:  SHE CROUCHES IN HIDING.  IN DEEP FOCUS, BEYOND HER,
     AND HIGH ABOVE HER, WE SEE THE MAN SILHOUETTED AS HE BEGINS
     TO WALK ALONG LIKE A CAT ON A GARDEN WALL, ABLE TO SEE ON
     BOTH SIDES INTO WHATEVER ROOMS HE IS PASSING.

     HE DROPS OFF THE WALL FOR A MOMENT INTO HER BEDROOM.
     INTERCUT MAN AND HELEN.  HE LOOKS FOR HER, PRODS THE BED
     COVERS.

     THEN LEAPS BACK UP TO THE TOP OF THE WALL.

     SHE TAKES A VASE AND THROWS IT OVER THE WALL INTO THE
     ADJACENT ROOM.  THE MAN'S FIGURE DOESN'T EVEN SLOW, HE'S
     ALREADY FIGURED IT OUT:  HE LEAPS CLEAR ACROSS AN OPENING
     ONTO THE WALL THAT LEADS DIRECTLY TO HER.

     SHE HITS THE REMOTE:  THE CURTAINS SWEEP OPEN, AND MORE LIGHT
     COMES IN NOW FROM THE STREET.

     CLOSE, THE MAN: HIS FACE TURNS TO THE LIGHT: FROM THIS HIGH
     ANGLE WE AND WE SEE DOWN INTO THE STREET, WHERE

     RUBEN'S CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP.  RUBEN charges into the
     building.

     BURT, COMING AWAKE, FOLLOWS RUBEN up the stairs three at a
     time.

     HALLWAY AND APARTMENT DOOR:  THE MAN COMES RACING OUT AND
     TURNS TOWARD THE STAIRS, JUST AS RUBEN REACHES HELEN'S
     FLOOR.  THE MAN TRIES TO DO A 180, BUT RUBEN THROWS A BODY
     BLOCK AND THE MAN FALLS BACK INSIDE THE APARTMENT.

     LIGHT FROM HALL GIVES US OUR FIRST LOOK AS RUBEN TEARS THE
     BALACLAVA OFF HIS FACE.  He is a middle-aged Afro-Asian with
     a knife-scarred face.

                    MAN
          I can explain!

                    RUBEN
          The fuck you can!
               (shouts)
          Helen!  Are you okay?  HELEN!

     Then he sees her.  In shock, she stares down at the MAN.

                    RUBEN
          Did this animal touch you?

     She shakes her head, turns and runs out of the room, as
     RUBEN catches sight of BURT.

                    RUBEN
          Turn on a light and call in the
          unit.  NOW!

     BURT rushes to okay.  RUBEN FRISKS THE MAN.

                    MAN
          No gun!

                    RUBEN
          Bullshit's gonna get your balls
          stomped on!  What's your name?

                    MAN
          Chow.  Conrad Chow.

     The improbability of this name makes RUBEN deliver an angry
     kick to the man's side.

                    MAN
          Swear to God!  Conrad Chow.  Never
          carry a gun.

                    BURT
          Backup's here...

                    RUBEN
               (to Burt)
          Then you get your ass outta here, I
          don't wanta see you again...

                    CONRAD
          I brought a present for the lady,
          there.  I'm looking for her, to give
          her the present...

                    RUBEN
          You break into her apartment to
          deliver a gift?  Where is it?

                    CONRAD
          The door was open, swear to God,
          I'm just looking for her when you
          come charging up the stairs...

                    RUBEN
          Where is it?

                    CONRAD
          I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the
          lady's pillow...

     Ruben shoves Conrad into Backup Cop's hands.

     INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Ruben comes running in, sees a parcel lying on pillow... 
     scoops it up, and rips it open.  It's a book.  He returns
     to Conrad, who is now surrounded by police.  Ruben holds the
     book up like a question.

                    CONRAD
          Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that
          book, he wanted the lady to have
          it.  They won't let him send it to
          her, so I'm getting out, he asks me
          to deliver it in person, he says,
          put it on her pillow.  It has all
          about how he tried to kill her.

                    RUBEN
          He told you she was loaded, any-
          thing you could steal you could
          keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself
          a return ticket to Quentin,
          breaking and entering.

                    CONRAD
          The door was already open...

                    RUBEN
          We know...
               (to a cop)
          Send the book to evidence...

                    CONRAD
          She's supposed to have it.

                    RUBEN
          She don't want it.

     INT. HELEN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

     HELEN is sitting on the floor, her knees pulled up to her
     chest.

                    RUBEN (V.O.)
          Helen?  Open the door.  The guy's
          nothing.  A burglar.

     She sits there, says nothing.

                    RUBEN (V.O.)
          Open the door.  Please.

                    HELEN
          Why don't you shoot off the lock?

     She starts to laugh.  The sound is awful.  After a moment,
     she gets up on wobbly legs and opens the door.  RUBEN takes
     her to the sink, sort of sits her down on it.  Wets a
     washcloth, goes to sponge off her face.  She is trembling.

                    HELEN
          He was in my apartment!

                    RUBEN
          I know, baby.  I know.

     Without warning, in some sort of manic phase of a freak-out,
     she breaks away from him, ricochets through bedroom, down
     the hallway, RUBEN follows, tries to put his arms around
     her.

                    RUBEN
          It's okay... you're safe with me!

     He pulls her down into a chair with him, his arms tight
     around her, holding her still.  He smoothes her hair, rubs
     her neck, pets her like a frightened and resistant cat.

                    RUBEN
          When I was a little kid, and I'd be
          in a state, my father would hold me
          on his lap, until all the fight
          would go out of me...

     She breaks free and whacks him across his nose.

                    HELEN
          You think you're my Daddy?

     There is something so perverse about this, so erotic, that
     RUBEN kisses her.  She goes limp, kisses him back, then
     she's suddenly sobbing.  His nose is bleeding, but she's
     smiling.  Something between them has finally connected.
     Been agreed upon.

                    RUBEN
          Helen...honey, you know I gotta go.

     He digs out his sneaky gun from whenever he keeps it.

                    RUBEN
          You know how to use this?

                    HELEN
          They taught me at the FBI.  I was
          very good at it.  It scared me... I
          liked it.

                    RUBEN
          You take it, hang on to it, it'll
          make you feel safer.  Stay put.

                    HELEN
          What else?

     He goes.

     A SONG BEGINS, PRELAPPING THE FOLLOWING SCENES:  "MURDER BY
     NUMBERS" BY THE POLICE...

          "Once that you've decided on a killing
          First you make a stone of your heart
          And if you find that your hands are still willing
          You can turn murder into an art..."

     HELEN OPENS THE WEAPON, SEEMINGLY COMPETENT ENOUGH TO HANDLE
     IT WELL, AND EMPTIES OUT THE BULLETS.  SHE LOCKS IT UP AND
     HEAVES A SIGH OF RELIEF.

     THE SONG CONTINUES...

                                   CUT TO:

     EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     THE FBI ARRIVES.  High angle, looking down: three identical
     cars draw in front, park with military precision: all four
     doors on the all three cars open at the same time and
     identically dressed men, in suits, get out, slam the doors
     in sync., and march toward the front steps to HQ, ignoring a
     couple of bemused cops smoking on the sidewalk...

     INT. POLICE HQ - CONTINUOUS

     As the parade of FBI, led by their Commander SAKS, walk down
     the corridor from the front door, toward CAMERA, performing
     a smart right angle turn, and (CAMERA PANNING TO FOLLOW)
     continue away from CAMERA down another corridor.  Through
     the glass partitions and in the halls they pass cops who
     pretend they aren't looking at them: no eye contact between
     cops and FBI.  The cops are at ease; bellies slop over
     belts; neatly pressed blouses strain over breasts; sweat
     stains; shirtsleeves.  The marching men wouldn't sweat.

     QUINN emerges from his office and sees them arriving.  He
     gets his jacket off a hook on the back of the door, signals
     a few top officers to follow.  He looks resigned...

     INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (LATER)

     M.J., RUBEN, NIKKO, and a number of other officers are being
     addressed by SAKS, an FBI agent.  At the back are three more
     FBI AGENTS, suited and tied.  QUINN stands off to one side.
     THE SONG IS JUST ENDING, ON A CD PLAYER IN THE ROOM.  A
     projector beams up a copy of the note RUBEN found in the
     phone booth.

          Dr. Hudson:  Don't lose your head.
          "Once that you've decided on a killing
          First you make a stone of your heart
          And if you find that your hands are still willing
          You can turn murder into an art.
          Well, if you have a taste for this experience
          You're flushed with your very first success
          Then you must try a twosome or a threesome
          Before your conscience bothers you much less.
          Then you can join the ranks of the illustrious
          In history's great dark hall of fame
          All of our greatest killers were industrious
          At least the ones that we all know by name."

     SAKS speaks...

                    SAKS
          Hello.  I am (research title)
          Meryhew Saks.  The song is called
          "Murder By Numbers."  The
          performers are a group called The
          Police.  Adam here...
                ... from Behavioral Science is
          working out exactly what this
          perpetrator is trying to telegraph
          in the note.  This is an extremely
          complex case, and we have a lot of
          fancy theories floating around.
          We're not ruling out the possib-
          ility of three Copycat serial
          killers.  We have Quantico working
          on graphology, the Washington lap
          is cloning DNA from the secretor.
          It's our feeling that the best lead
          we have is the two sperm samples in
          one of the victims.  We have a team
          sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want
          to say a few word to you local
          people.  Your Commissioner asked
          for our assistance.  The Bureau
          does not send us in on these cases
          to lord it over the local police.
          We couldn't catch up on what you
          people know if we had a year.  We
          have nation-wide resources and hard
          state of the art forensic science;
          you have the local savvy.  Together
          we can be unbeatable.  Which one is
          Inspector Halloran?

                    M.J.
          Over here.

     SAKS approaches M.J., guides her away from the others.
     TWO SHOT:  Saks is unctuous and insincere, self-confident.

                    SAKS
          We don't see too many lady homicide
          detectives.  You have my respect.
          Have you discussed the note with
          Dr. Hudson?

                    M.J.
          Someone broke into her place last
          night.  It wasn't connected to our
          case, but it shook her up pretty
          bad so I haven't...

     QUINN joins them, SAKS gives him a nod.

                    SAKS
          I was just about to advise the
          Inspector here not to show Dr.
          Hudson the note.

                    M.J.
          Sir, Doctor Hudson and I see a
          pattern develop...

                    SAKS
               (riding over her)
          We know Helen.  She's not exactly a
          credible collaborator.  Especially
          late in the day...

                    M.J.
          She takes tranquilizers her doctor
          prescribes.

                    SAKS
          Who prescribes the brandy?

     M.J.'S look makes SAKS smile.  QUINN is called to the phone.

                    M.J.
          How come you're so up on Dr.
          Hudson?

                    SAKS
          She is a writer, writing best
          selling books about serial killing.
          Giving lectures she's well-paid
          for.  Her interests are not the
          interests of law enforcement.

                    M.J.
          Okay.

                    SAKS
          We've put a tap on Dr. Hudson's
          phone.  I know you won't mention
          it.

     So much for any trusting relationship, right?  QUINN has
     arrived, addresses SAKS.

                    QUINN
          Sorry to interrupt.  I need a word
          with my officer...

     He turns to M.J.  Diplomatically, SAKS moves away.

                    QUINN
          M.J., I'm going to have to borrow
          Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing
          in Chinatown is going down tomorrow
          night and Jack's kid got hit by a
          car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.

                    M.J.
          What does this mean?  Now we got
          the FBI, my team is expendable?
          I'm working my ass off, is anybody
          listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He
          and Nikko don't even get on
          together...

                    QUINN
          Teach both of them a lesson in
          cooperation and self-discipline.

                    M.J.
          If this is a first step in kicking
          me off the case, just tell me, to
          my face, sir, don't waste time
          being diplomatic.

                    QUINN
          Just, I need results.  And -- I am
          short-handed.  Who else am I gonna
          give him?

                    M.J.
               (looking at Saks)
          Give him thatpompous son of a
          bitch.

     She turns and leaves, brushing past Saks as she goes... Gigi
     meets her...

                    GIGI
          Lab called.  They got a result on
          the drug test you requested...?

     It takes a moment to remember what it was...

                    GIGI
          They said it was Windex?

     If there was any residual doubt about what's happening, it's
     gone now.  She starts after Quinn, sees he is in spirited
     dialogue with SAKS and decides to wait.

     INT. HELEN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

     HELEN and M.J.  Helen unfolds a xerox copy of the note, that
     M.J. has just given her.

                    HELEN
          ..."I'll be back..."

     As she looks at the back of the note... she looks up into
     M.J.'S face.

                    M.J.
          Yeah.  Addressed to you.  "Don't
          lose your head."

     Helen puts down the note.  She is holding herself together
     by main will power... doesn't want to face that note...

                    HELEN
          They put  Merry Saks on it?!

                    M.J.
          He said to send you his regards and 
          to tell you that the Bureau holds
          you in the highest esteem.

                    HELEN
          What I can't believe is that in an
          earlier life I slept with him!
          Christ!  Any God that loved his
          people would give women a rewind on
          their life and an erase button.
               (looks at M.J.)
          Just give me a minute here.  The
          letter is addressed to me...
               (she's breathing
                fast, controls it)
          You don't feel fear, do you?
          You're young.  You feel like you'll
          live forever.  How wonderful.

                    M.J.
          I put my ass on the line, giving
          you that.

                    HELEN
          They weren't going to show it to
          me?!  The arrogance!  It's my life!

                    M.J.
          It's also the major piece of
          evidence, and it makes you a key
          part of his plan.  You can't run
          away from it anymore.
               (beat)
          Look at the order he's doing
     them... He did three as the Boston
          Strangler just to tell us a copycat
          serial killer was at work.  Then he
          did one like the Hillside Strang-
          ler.  And then one as Son of Sam.
          To lead us on -- to where and what
          end?  And he's doing more than that
          -- he's imitating each killer's
          method as closely as he can -- in
          details.  Injecting Windex.  Using
          .44.  Playing Abba.

                    HELEN
          It's not chronological: Son of Sam
          was before Hillside.

     She begins to read.

                    M.J.
          It's clear he thinks he knows me.
          He lives a fantasy.  'Helen, don't
          lose your head.'  Is that a threat?
          Does he want to cut off my head?
          Dahmer cut off heads.  Who else?
          Kemper.  Did Gacy?  Rivkind?  I
          think Rivkind did.

     She puts the note down on the table, smoothes it out.  She
     closes her eyes for a moment.  We begin to see certain
     filtered images.  As they come, we INTERCUT them.

                    HELEN
          He attacks what he feels he can't
          have.  What he feels excluded
          from...

     EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

     Lush, pastoral green.  We see PETER sitting by himself.  He
     wears a WHITE LAB COAT, like one we saw hanging in his
     basement.

     HIS POV:  of students on the green, playing Frisbee,
     studying together, picnicking.  Women sunbathe, their straps
     pulled down on their shoulders, their tops rolled up to
     expose their midriffs.

                    HELEN (V.O.)
          'First you make a stone of your
          heart.'... Oh yes!  He doesn't
          suffer.  That's past.  Now it's our
          turn.

     One of the sunbathing girls sits up and looks round, then
     takes her top off entirely.

                    HELEN (V.O.)
          Kemper said in order to have the
          experience he wanted with them, he
          needed to evict them from their
          bodies.  By making the body a
          completely passive object, he
          releases himself from passivity.

     CLOSE:  HELEN, DEEP IN THOUGHT...

                    HELEN
          But the relief he feels is only
          temporary.  '...Before your
          conscience bothers you much
          less...'  But the tension always
          comes back.
               (she now picks out
                the words:)
          'You can join the ranks of the
          illustrious...'  He wants to be
          like them.  The best.  To become
          the best.  But, he has his own
          desires, his own compulsions apart
          from theirs.'  His own horrors...

     FLASHBACK: PETER'S CHILDHOOD HOME - DAY

     An incremental flash of a SMALL BOY standing by his bed
     which he has wet.  His pajamas are soaked.  His powerful
     MOTHER grabs him by the hair and drags him with her.

                    HELEN (V.O.)
          Some horrors that are all his
          own...

     The SMALL BOY is flung into an under-stairs closet where
     firewood and stacked papers are kept.  The door is slammed
     hard.  He gropes around in the darkness, finds a big box of
     matches, lights one.  Then, angrily, he sets fire to a pile
     of newspapers.  They start to burn.  We see, but do not,
     hear, his screams for help.

                    HELEN (V.O.)
          He needs to prove they don't
          control him, that he's the one in
          control.  But the feeling of power
          never lasts.  He can control his
          victims, but he can't control
          anything else... his place in the
          world.  He want s to be recognized.
          He puts messages in my computer; he
          sends me a letter...

     INT. HELEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

     She picks out the lines... "then you must try a twosome or a
     threesome."

                    HELEN
          Of course he wants to do a
          threesome!  Only Bundy did three in
          one day.  Is Bundy next?  But Bundy
          should be last... the grand finale.
          What about Kemper and Ramirez?
          Gacy, Dahmer, Williams?  Rivkind?
          Who else is on his list?  In what
          order?

     EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

     PETER in his car.  Ahead, he see TWO GIRLS at a bus stop.
     We see PETER take a long bladed-knife and carefully conceal
     it under his right thigh.  The TWO GIRLS are wearing
     backpacks.  'FESTIVAL OF LOVE' stickers decorate the bags.
     PETER pulls his nondescript sedan up to them and says
     something.  They giggle, shake their heads.  He laughs,
     holds up his hands to level of his shoulders in a 'Not
     guilty!' gesture, then makes a peace sign.  The girls giggle
     again, but do not get in.

     PETER drives off.

          greatest heroes?  He wants to be
          famous.  When they're caught and
          people like me write about them, we
          give them a kind of immortality.
          They get thousands of letters.
          Ramirez kills eight women and gets
          a hundred marriage proposals a
          month.  They're like film stars.

                    M.J.

          It's not a real name: it's the name
          of a mass murderer in Germany in
          the 1930s.  They called him the
          Monster of Dusseldorf.

          Let's speed up the game plan...
          call all the living serials to ask
          if they've had contact with a Peter
          Kurten.  We could use some help on

     atmosphere charged...

                    M.J.
          Do those things really help?

     Like she really wished they might, so she could have one.
     Helen looks at her cigarette as though she'd never seen one
     before... grinds it out...

                    HELEN
          Not a damn bit...

     And unconsciously lights another during following...
     PHONE RINGS.  M.J. PICKS IT UP, LISTENS, HANDS IT TO HELEN...
     Gestures encouragement; fist in victory gesture...

                                   INTERCUT TO:

     INT.  PENITENTIARY INTERVIEW ROOM

     DARYLL LEE CULLUM is on the phone, a Warden is attendance,
     but not on the phone line.  On this rare contact with the
     outside world HE IS MANIC...

                    DARYLL LEE
          Hey, Doc!  How you doing?

     She turns on speakerphone.

                    HELEN
          Hello, Daryll Lee.

                    DARYLL
          You read my book which as you know,
          hit the stands a couple of weeks
          ago.  You read it yet.

                    HELEN
          What book?

                    DARYLL
               (indignant)
          I sent it by private courier, he
          didn't give it to you?  That son of
          a gun...!

     Helen looks at M.J., who indicates 'tell you later.'

                    HELEN
          I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.

                    DARYLL
          Bet you never figured I'd follow in
          your footsteps.  It's real well-
          written.  You should read it --
          you're in it.

                    HELEN
          I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and
          talk to you about it after I've
          read it.  Right now I have a
          question... Peter Kurten.

                    DARYLL
          Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I
          told that son I'd send him what he
          wanted if he leave you alone.

                    HELEN
          Ah ha.  What did he want?

                    DARYLL
          Something personal.  Is he bothering
          you?

                    HELEN
          I don't know.  I'd like to know
          where he is.

                    DARYLL
          Listen, you want my advice?  Steer
          clear.  He's writing me he's gonna
          finish 'my unfinished symphony.'
          He's gonna give me $550 for some of
          my cum, he says he's in a position
          to see that I will be immortal if
          he has some of my spunk.  I'm
          offended.  Right away I smell
          freak.  Writin' about him and me
          and you bein' joined and he's gonna
          finish my symphony?  I didn't care
          for his drift.  I sent some liquid
          soap in a sandwich baggie with a
          message from Jesus to mend his
          ways.  You hear I found Jesus?  And
          what's funny is, now I don't mind
          bein' inside.  If I was out, even
          Born Again, I'd probably get
          restless again.  It's maybe better
          I stay here, what do you think?

                    HELEN
          I think whatever is best for you,
          Daryll.  And maybe you're right,
          that's the place.

                    DARYLL
          You come and visit.

                    HELEN
          Where did you send the message to
          Peter Kurten?

                    DARYLL
          Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too!
          That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to
          Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in
          return for getting my book to you.

     At this mention of Conrad, M.J. leaps to another phone...

                    HELEN
          How was Conrad supposed to find
          Kurten?

                    DARYLL
          Conrad has the phone number.
          Conrad, where is he?

                    HELEN
               (from M.J.'s pantomime)
          In jail.

                    DARYLL
          That Klutz.  They send him back
          here, I'll kick his ass good.

                    DARYLL LEE
          Helen, how is life, you okay?  Come
          see me, talk to me.  I think about
          you, worry about you all the time.
          I am so glad Jesus didn't let me
          kill you.  You know -- you're
          blessed by Jesus.  That's why you
          need to come talk to me, because
          Jesus kept you alive for a reason,
          and I was his sacred instrument...
          In the moment Satan was in my heart
          raising my hand to kill you, Jesus
          took my hand to spare you.  I am
          both death and life to you...

     Helen hangs up.  M.J. has already left...

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

     Pandemonium: the Chinatown raid has been carried off and
     NIKKO AND RUBEN and a dozen other cops are booking a group
     of Chinese gangsters of all ages, and a group of frightened
     and confused Chinese illegal aliens.  TOTAL UPROAR.

     THROUGH IT, WE MOVE WITH M.J.  SHE PASSES RUBEN WHO IS
     GRABBING A CHINESE KID STRUNG OUT ON SOMETHING, OUT OF A
     LINE OF SUSPECTS... HE ASIDES:

                    M.J.
          I brought back a gin-seng popper
          for you.  Guaranteed all-night
          orgasms.

                    M.J.
          Save it for Helen.

                    RUBEN
               (enough already!)
          Wait a minute, wait a goddamn
          minute...

     He manhandles the KID INTO DOCILITY WHILE...

                    RUBEN
          The woman was in shock.  She was
          totally out on ranks.  I stayed
          because I didn't want her to wake
          up alone in a place where she'd
          just been under attack.
               (to the Kid who is
                restless)
          Stop that, you son of a bitch!
               (back to her)
          The place wasn't secure.  I was
          doing my goddamn job!  And, for the
          second time, I slept in her living
          room.

                    M.J.
          Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't
          have the face for it.  I need you
          to help interrogate the burglar in
          Hudson's place...

                    RUBEN
          Talk to Nikko...!

     SHE MOVES ON TO FIND NIKKO

     NIKKO sites at his desk, processing the papers for the sullen
     YOUNG THUG who is handcuffed to a chain next to NIKKO'S
     desk.  Nikko  unholsters his gun... he shoves it into his
     desk drawer...

                    NIKKO
          You speak English?
               (Chinese)
          You need an interpreter?

     QUINN, walking past the ILLEGALS, speaks to GIGI.

                    QUINN
          I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted
          just the bastards dumping them in
          the harbor.  What's keeping those
          bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in
          here...

     M.J. STANDS OVER NIKKO

                    M.J.
          I gotta have Ruben, and a...

     HARROWING SCREAM!!!  ILLEGAL WOMAN IS SCREAMING --
     PANDEMONIUM AMONG THE DETAINEES.  COPS RUSH TO CONTROL THE
     PROBLEM.

                    NIKKO
          Outta your mind?  Look at this...

                    M.J.
               (to Quinn)
          Lieutenant...?

     Just at that moment the kid Ruben was booking goes totally
     bananas; M.J. goes to his assistance, wrestling this wild
     kid.

     NIKKO starts from his chair, looking for the key to the
     drawer, but is isn't there... he goes to help Ruben get the
     kid under control.  Quinn steps in...

                    M.J.
          The prowler in Hudson's apartment
          turns out to have a meeting with a
          suspect...

                    QUINN
               (amazed)
          You got a suspect...

     THEY MOVE BACK TO NIKKO'S DESK.

                    QUINN
          How'd you get in on the deal?

                    M.J.
          I'm gonna drop charges on the
          break-and-enter at Hudson's...

                    QUINN
          You have no authority to make a
          deal like that.  That' s for the
          D.A...

                    M.J.
          Or the F.B.I.?

                    QUINN
          Saks.  If he knew you did that!
          They're all asking me, 'what is she
          doing,' as it is.

                    M.J.
          Give me Ruben back...

                    QUINN
          Nikko?

                    NIKKO
          We get through this shit, let 'em
          all go.

     NIKKO has stood and moved the handcuffed THUG toward the
     door to jail cells.  M.J. checks her time, (WALL CLOCKS HELP
     US HERE:  8:47)

                    M.J.
          I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll
          be in the jail when you wind this
          up...

                    RUBEN
          I gotta get something to eat, I
          haven't eaten all day.

     M.J. goes... RUBEN can't find a desk to work at, and
     commandeers Nikko's.  He slams the KID into NIKKO'S chair
     and cuffs him.  KID starts to rattle his chairs, spew
     Chinese epithets, then bends over the desk and, with his
     teeth picks up some paper, tries to shake it to shreds.

     RUBEN yanks the papers out of the KID'S mouth, pulls the
     KID'S chair from the side to the front of the desk, shoves
     the KID into place facing away from the desk, so that he
     can't do any more damage.  Then RUBEN can't figure out where
     he can work.  At the next desk, where he has been working,
     MAC rises.

                    MAC
          Here... I'm finished...

                    RUBEN
               (to Kid)
          I'm going to the coffee machine.
          Hold the fort.

     He moves off, the KID'S eyes move calculatingly around the
     room.  He twists against the cuffs, trying anything to get
     free, and discovers he can pull out the desk drawer.

     CLOSE UP:  The KID'S FREE HAND rifling through the drawer
     behind his back, finding the gun.  PULL BACK to show the
     KID.  He is as Ruben positioned him, his back pressed
     against the desk.

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. CITY JAIL CELL - DAY

     CONRAD is brought in by a Guard.  Lightly shacked.  M.J.
     stands.  Conrad sits.

                    CONRAD
          Who are you?

                    M.J.
          Inspector Halloran.  Homicide.
          You were supposed to contact a
          Peter Kurten?

                    CONRAD
               (cagey)
          I was?  How you spell that?

                    M.J.
          Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the
          length of my arm...

                    CONRAD
               (interrupting)
          I never hurt nobody...

                    M.J.
          Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got
          felony breaking and entering,
          burglary, felonious...

                    CONRAD
               (interrupting)
          I never carried a gun!

     She slaps him hard!  He is shocked.

                    M.J.
          You don't listen very good.  This
          break in -- I can call it a felony --
          three strikes, and you got about
          sixteen strikes already, and you're
          in jail for the rest of your life,
          no parole.  Or I could see it gets
          forgotten.

                    CONRAD
          You get me out first.

                    M.J.
          Doesn't work that way.  You had your
          chance, now fuck yourself...

     She's walking to the door... Conrad holds out just one more
     beat to see if she's bluffing... her hand is on the door
     knob...

                    CONRAD
          Tell me what you want me to say.
          Anything.

                    M.J.
          You were going to make a delivery
          to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee
          Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone
          number.

                    CONRAD
          I don't have it...

     M.J. starts to open the door...

                    CONRAD
          Wait... wait... I already called
          him, I threw it away.

                    M.J.
          You already made the delivery?

                    CONRAD
          No, that's still in my jacket I was
          wearing.  We were supposed to meet
          on the docks, that number 47 wharf,
          10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand
          me 500 bucks.

                    M.J.
          What Friday?

                    CONRAD
          What day is this?  In jail you lose
          track.  This week.  Friday.

     M.J. is already on her way...

                    CONRAD
          Don't forget me, please.  I told
          you what you wanted -- don't forget
          me.

     EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

     DESERTED.  A LONG SHADOW OF A MAN STRETCHES OUT ACROSS THE
     DOCK.  IT IS PETER, WALKING LEISURELY FROM THE WATERFRONT
     DRIVE TOWARD THE HUGE WATERHOUSE AT THE END OF THE DOCK.  HE
     STEPS INTO THE DEEP SHADOWS AND SEEMS TO VANISH.

     CLOSE:  PETER.  HE CHECKS HIS WATCH AND TURNS TO WATCH THE
     DOCK AND THE SHORE.  HE CAN SEE AND NOT BE SEEN.  HE IS 
     ENTIRELY ALONE NOW.

     INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

     RUBEN takes coffee and doughnuts out of a box, then leans
     over the KID who seems to have calmed down.  He uncuffs him
     from the chair.

                    RUBEN
          Behave.  You refuse my hospitality,
          I'm putting you to bed.

     He pushes the coffee toward the Kid, who WHIPS NIKKO'S GUN
     OUT FROM UNDER THE DESK, where it was hidden, and lays it up
     under Ruben's ear.  KID moves behind RUBEN and puts a skinny
     arm around RUBEN'S neck, pulling him upright.  RUBEN still
     clutching the doughnut box.  It takes a moment for the
     others to SEE.  Then the room is absolutely motionless.

                    NIKKO
          Take it easy, Kid.  Nobody's gonna
          do anything.  Just let the gun
          down, so it don't go off...

     A CHINESE DETECTIVE REPEATS THE SAME IDEA IN CHINESE...

                    KID
               (screams)
          Nobody comes through the door...

     Behind the KID, as he backs through the door, across the
     corridor we LOOK STRAIGHT DOWN A CORRIDOR TO WHERE M.J. IS
     COMING ALMOST AT A RUN -- SHE SEES what is happening.

     The KID doesn't see her, yet, as he is backing away from the
     others... M.J. DRAWS HER GUN AND STANDS IN FIRING POSITION.

     IF SHE FIRES FROM HERE RUBEN IS DIRECTLY BEHIND THE KID, AND
     OTHER OFFICERS, IN THE LINE THE BULLET WOULD TAKE ARE STILL
     SCRAMBLING OUT OF HER LINE... SHE CAN'T FIRE.

                    M.J.
          Hey, you...

     The KID turns, sees her, exposing his shoulder to her... SHE
     FIRES AND HITS THE KID.

     HE IS THROWN TO THE FLOOR AND TWISTED AROUND BY THE IMPACT,
     LANDING BEHIND RUBEN SO SHE CAN'T MAKE A SECOND SHOT.

     RUBEN GOES FOR HIS OWN GUN, BUT THE KID'S GUN THAT FELL FROM
     HIS HAND IS RIGHT BY HIM STILL.  THE KID GRABS IT AND FIRES
     BEFORE RUBEN HAS HIS GUN ALL THE WAY OUT OF HIS HOLSTER.  THE
     KID SHOOTS RUBEN IN THE THROAT AT AN ANGLE THAT TAKES THE
     BULLET STRAIGHT INTO HIS BRAIN.

     THEN THE KID THROWS THE GUN AWAY, AND STANDS, HIS HANDS UP
     IN SURRENDER, A GRIN ON HIS FACE.  THIS ENTIRE ACTION HAS
     TAKEN ABOUT SIX SECONDS.  THE KID GOES DOWN, FLATTENED BY
     BODIES OF THE COPS WHO HAVE RUSHED HIM.

                    KID
          I'm a juvenile!  I'm a juvenile!

     M.J. RUSHES TO RUBEN.

     EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

     PETER, STANDING AS BEFORE.  CHECKS HIS WATCH, LIGHTS A
     CIGARETTE.

     INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

     The KID has been taken away.  PARAMEDICS are removing
     RUBEN'S body.  M.J. stands frozen as RUBEN'S stretcher is
     carried out of the room.  Her hand holds the doughnut box.

     Finally, M.J. blinks, her head turns as if she can't imagine
     what to do, where to go.  Then, suddenly conscious of the
     doughnut box, she clutches it tight against her chest.

     CLOSE:  M.J.

     She abruptly remembers: the rendezvous with Peter Kurten!

                    M.J.
          Gigi!  Dock 47.  I need a couple
          units to drag the area...

          are you going to say?

                    NIKKO
          Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking
          drawer!  You spend twenty years
          thinking some perp's gonna whack
          you... you'll crash your car... but
          what happens is, you fuck
          yourself...

          Want to hear something weird?  I
          feel like I'd give my life to bring
          him back.

          You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.

          You were right!  He knew me!  He
          went to my lectures.  He recorded
          them!  Listen to this...

     She is too full of her own shock to wonder why M.J. is here
     at this hour and to notice the state M.J. is in... she has
     turned back to the answering machine and hits the play

          Where's the john?  Let me clean up
          this mess, and get back to work.

     Helen has stepped to her brandy decanter; M.J., too dejected
     to move, sits, staring now at the only thing to stare at: the
     computer screen.

          Who's the married man?

                    M.J.
          What does it matter?  This guy, you
          checked your course records, who
          signed up?

     Helen returns with the brandy.  M.J. holds it, doesn't drink,
     just stares at the computer screen, emotionally dead...

                    HELEN
          The University computer is down for
          maintenance, but I've been going
          through my own notes...

               (her voice is dead)
          Look.  There's the order:  you
          wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi &
          Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's
          going to be Dahmer next.  Which
          means he'll kill a man.

     With an effort of will M.J. moves to the phone, putting the
     brandy down.

                    HELEN
          Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...

          Are you looking for it?  Oh, God,

          this what...?

     SOUND:  HER FRONT DOOR OPENS.  She starts, turns.  Feet
     moving toward her, but quietly, cautiously.  As the
     footsteps turn into the hall.  She stands, reaching for
     anything to defend herself with: a paperknife.  She moves to
     the door, raising the knife... footsteps closer... A man
     turns into the office, and she launches herself, only
     stopping the stab of the knife at the last split second...

     ANDY.  She SCREAMS!

                    ANDY
          Stop screaming!

     She screams again.  Then smothers him with kisses and
     hugs...

                    ANDY
          For God's sake, stop -- my head!  I
          have the Iraqi mother of all hang-
          overs.  Very quiet in the hospital
          zone, please.

     She clings to him.

                    HELEN
          Where have you been?  What happened
          to your wallet?

                    ANDY
          Hal has it.

     INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

     SAKS is sitting on edge of a desk.  M.J. is standing, and
     QUINN is sitting almost knee-to-knee with ANDY.

          ...then he gave me a popper and I
          started to feel really wild... all
          over the dance floor.  Then
          suddenly I was just s o stoned.  And
          sick?  I had to race for the
          john... horribly sick.  Over and
          over and over.  I was in there a
          very long time.  And when I came
          out they were gone.  So was my
          jacket which I'd tossed to Hal when
          I was dancing.  Hal was my...
          Could I have a glass of water?

     An FBI man intrudes... with a printout of a driver's

          Mister Saks.  We gotta Peter Foley,
          medical technician in a fertility
          clinic in Oakland.  We got a home

                    ANDY
               (looking at license)
          That's him.

                    SAKS
          Got him!

     THE FBI AND THE COPS ALL RISE AND ARE ON THEIR WAY OUT.

                    QUINN
          I called our SWAT Commander...
               (to Saks)
          He's ours now... You come watch
          our boys in action...

     And walks away...

     SWAT TEAM SURROUNDING THE HOUSE, WITH GREAT QUIET AND EFFORT
     TO CONCEAL THE OPERATION.  QUINN in command over a SWAT
     COMMANDER -- JENSEN.  There are ambulances, a fire truck,
     search lights.  SWAT TEAM, AND FBI all wear bulky flack
     jackets, with yellow ID stencilled on the back.  Quinn sees
     M.J., huddled in her old oversize jacket, gestures M.J.
     should have a flack jacket like theirs.  She taps her chest,
     where she has a bullet-proof vest under her shirt.

     THE HOUSE:  VARIOUS SHOTS, SILHOUETTED FIGURES MOVING TO

     A HAND GASPS THE HANDLE OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE A GUN; AS IT IS
     BROUGHT UP INTO A WIDER VIEW IT HAS A LONG BARREL WHICH
     SUDDENLY SHOOTS FLAME: A PROPANE BARBECUE LIGHTER...

     EXT. HOUSE

     THEY ARE ALMOST READY FOR THE FIRST MOVE; THREE SWAT MEN BY

          above your head...(etc.)

     INSIDE A SMOKE ALARM BEGINS TO GO.  LIGHT FLICKERS IN CELLAR
     WINDOWS.

     SWAT MEN AT THE DOOR: THEY SMASH THE LOCK AND CHARGE IN.  M.J.
     AND OTHER DETECTIVES WITH THEM.

     INT. HOUSE

     A dozen men pour into the house from front and back,
     converging in the dimly lit living room.  SMOKE OBSCURES
     EVERYTHING.  The dining room and kitchen are empty.  M.J.
     FOLLOWS CONTINGENT THAT RACES UPSTAIRS.  OTHERS FAN OUT
     THROUGH THE WHOLE STRUCTURE.  FIREMEN COME BEHIND LOOKING
     FOR THE FIRE.

     INT. PETER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     SMOKE IS THINNER HERE.  The room lighted only by the
     glowing TV screen.  The WIFE still in bed, shot through the
     head.  Others crowd in, kicking in closet and bathroom
     doors.  M.J. IS BY THE  BED JUST TURNING TO START ABACK
     DOWNSTAIRS LOOKING FOR PETER.

     SWAT MAN emerges from the bathroom with the body of NASTY
     LITTLE DOG, holding it by the tail:

     THEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT'S WARNING SIRES SHRIEK:  THEY MEAN
     EVERYBODY OUT... FIREMEN CHARGE FOR EXITS...

     AS THEY CHARGE THROUGH DOWNSTAIRS...

     M.J. CAN SEE TWO FIREMEN AT THE BASEMENT DOOR.  SMOKE BILLOWS
     FROM UNDER IT.  BEHIND IT WE HEAR SCREAMING.  THE FIREMEN
     SMASH THE DOOR, DROPPING TO THE FLOOR AS THEY DO...

     M.J'S POV: BLACK SMOKE BILLOWS OUT ACROSS THE CEILING
     THEN EXPLODES INTO WHITE HOT FLAME.  SHE HAS STEPPED FORWARD
     SO SHE CAN SEE OVER THE FIREMEN DOWN INTO THE BASEMENT: IN
     THE SUDDEN FLARE SHE SEES A MAN, WITH TIN-RIMMED GLASSES AND
     BLACK LEATHER CLOTHING ENTIRELY ENGULFED IN FLAME RUNNING UP
     THE BASEMENT STAIRS; BEHIND HIM THE BASEMENT IS BURNING.

     INT. BASEMENT

     LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP STAIRS: FLAME ALL AROUND -- PETER'S 
     PHOTO COLLAGES ON THE BULLETIN BOARD BURNING.  THE MAN 
     RUNNING UP THE STAIRS ALMOST MAKES IT TO THE TOP BEFORE
     HE FALLS BACK DOWN INTO THE CAMERA.  AT THE TOP, WE SEE M.J.
     AND THE FIREMEN'S APPALLED FACES.  THE SCREAMING DIES OFF...

     EXT. HOUSE

     FLAME NOW ENGULFING THE BASEMENT AND GROUND FLOOR: FIREMEN
     AND M.J. RACING OUT COUGHING AND CHOKING.

     THEN: A HUGE HOT FLOOM OF AN EXPLOSION: FLAMES THREATEN TO
     CONSUME THE ENTIRE HOUSE.  FIREMEN SWARM BACK TO KNOCK DOWN
     FLAME FROM OUTSIDE.

     M.J., QUINN, ETC., WATCHING THE EVIDENCE GO UP IN SMOKE.
     THEIR FACES LIGHTED BY THE FLAME.

     She has now changed into a pair of sweat pants and a
     T-shirt.  SUSAN SCHIFFER IS ON TV: WITH SHOTS OF THE FIRE
     BEING SNUFFED OUT.

                    SUSAN
          I am here with Lieutenant Quinn of
          the Homicide Division and (title)
          Saks of the FBI.  Can you tell us
          what happened here, tonight?

     During the following we move to PETER'S HOUSE where Quinn
     and Saks are being interviewed.

                    QUINN
          Susan, the San Francisco Police
          Department, assisted by the FBI,
          developed evidence that the serial
          killer, referred to as the Copycat
          killer was an individual who
          resided at this address.  Upon
          being asked to step out of the
          house to be interviewed, the
          suspect set fire to the house
          possibly to destroy evidence of his
          wife's murder.  We found her dead
          of gunshot wounds in an upstairs
          bedroom.  He himself died in the
          fire.
               (to shouted
                questions)
          No, we'll wait until we've located
          any relatives who should be
          notified.  Witnesses saw the
          individual burn to death, they were
          unable to reach him in time to save
          him.  We're glad, as the entire
          city must be glad, this reign of
          terror is ended.  No, no more at
          this time.  Thank you...

     END OF HELEN STARING STONILY AT THE SCREEN:  SHE DOESN'T

     INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT

     M.J., wearily enters.  Others quietly entering, slipping out
     coats, talking and drinking at some distance.  M.J. takes
     off her shoulder holster and gun and puts them down on her
     workspace.  NIKKO is at little distance cleaning out his
     desk.  He comes down to her as she sits...

                    NIKKO (V.O.)
          I heard. Good police work.

                    M.J.
          Just horseshit luck.

                    NIKKO
          Don't ever forget how good you are.

     He is standing behind her and leans over to almost touch her
     hair with his lips...

                    NIKKO
          I love you.

     He goes.  M.J. twists in misery and fury... Her phone is
     ringing on another line; she punches it...

          Helen.

          I saw him die.  I saw him burning on
          the basement stairs, he never
          reached the top.

                    HELEN
          They never kill themselves.  How do
          you know it was him.  You never met
          him.  You never even saw a
          photograph...

                    M.J.
          Helen -- let go.  You've got to let
          go.

                    HELEN
          He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done
          every one of the others, hasn't he?
          If there are three dead Chi Omega
          college girls tomorrow, how will
          you feel?  Go there.  See if there
          could be any way for him to escape.

                    M.J.
          This has been the worst 48 hours of
          my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going
          to try to get drunk.

                    HELEN
          If there's a one percent possibil-
          ity, can you live with yourself
          when he kills again?

          Oh, shut up, and don't be so damn
          self righteous.

     hitting another car.  She drives on until she is forced to
     stop at a traffic light.  All during this:

                    RADIO NEWS
          ...You're on the air, who's
          this...Ron, that's not my right
          name... that's okay, Ron. What are
          you afraid of?... I don't want
          anybody to know my name, because
          I'm a friend of Peter Foley?  I 
          know him from the gay community?  He
          was cruising the night...

     M.J. switches stations, channel surfing... bits of music,
     Rush Limbaugh, back to Ron droning on.

                    RADIO NEWS
          ...that I resent the tone of the
          Police and their attitude?  That
          this is just some weird queer
          event, just because they couldn't
          stop this guy until he did himself,
          if you even believe that...

     M.J. turns off the radio... when light turns green,
     instead of moving ahead, she just sits for a moment.  Then,
     furious with HELEN, with everything, she swears and wheels
     the car into a tight illegal u-turn.

     SHIFTING INTO GEAR WHEN SHE SPOTS:

     POV.  A GOLD COLORED VW BUG

     It is parked under a tree some distance across a parking lot
     jammed with student cars.  It is partly in shadow, so she
     could easily have missed it.  She jumps out of the car and
     moves fast up the steps through students, drinking, kissing,
     studying, arguing...

     INT. CHI OMEGA - NIGHT

     MAIN MEETING ROOM.  Full of people milling about.  Music is
     playing.  SEES THE BACK OF A TALL MAN ON CRUTCHES TALKING TO

     LAUGHING.  M.J. moving fast toward them, she runs into a
     girl, spilling the girls' drink on her blouse...

          Goddamn it!  This is brand new!
          Where're you going?

     As M.J. continues to move the Girl grabs her...

          No, you don't spill all over
          somebody and just walk away, you
          damn well pay the cleaning bill...

     M.J. holds up the badge...

                    M.J.
          Don't make me pull the gun...

     She jerks away, almost knocking the Girl down.  The Girl is
     yelling, beginning to attract attention.  As M.J. turns back
     to SEE.

     PETER AND THE COED are just moving off, the Coed holding his
     books, he hobbling on the crutches.  M.J. runs through the
     crowd toward him, and those who notice are pissed... she is
     getting close when, just as he and the coed would pass from
     sight behind a wall, PETER looks around, straight at M.J..

     IT ISN'T PETER AT ALL.

     M.J. LOOKING AROUND, MOVES TO STAIRS TO SECOND FLOOR...

     M.J. EMERGING FROM STAIRS INTO THE CORRIDOR -- SHE RUNS DOWN
     THIS CORRIDOR OF ROOMS, PUSHING OPEN ANY THAT ARE SHUT.

     A SCARED COUPLE MAKING LOVE CONFRONT HER GUN.  SHE
     REHOLSTERS IT AND RACES DOWN THE HALLWAY...

     OVER THE PARTY NOISE AND MUSIC WE HEAR A SCREAM.  M.J. RACES
     DOWN CORRIDORS, TRYING TO FIND THE SOURCE.  ANOTHER SCREAM.
     IT SEEMS TO COME FROM BEHIND A CLOSED DOOR.  M.J. KICKS IT
     OPEN, BURSTING IN:

     INT. ROOM

     A BUNCH OF STONED STUDENTS PASSING A JOINT: ON A TV PLAYER
     IS THE IMAGE OF JAMIE LEE CURTIS IN AN EARLY SHOCKER: THEY
     ARE PLAYING AT WHO CAN OUT-SCREAM JAMIE LEE CURTIS.

     WHEN JAMIE LEE CURTIS SCREAMS --

     THEY ALL SCREAM BACK!  AND BURST INTO HOWLS OF LAUGHTER.  THE
     SIGHT OF M.J. WITH HER GUN OUT ONLY MAKES THEM HOWL LOUDER.

                    STUDENT
          Swallow the joint!  It's Barney

          You like that action?  Didn't that
          cop on TV look solemn?  The guy in
          the basement doesn't matter,
          anyway, just another lonely heart.

          Where are you, Peter?

                    PETER
          You thought I was going to do Ted
          Bundy next, so you sent your
          partner...

     Helen gasps with the implications of that...

                    PETER
          What was that?  What am I hearing?
          The sound of an epiphany, a sudden
          blinding insight?

          It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?

          of it.  You don't want her, you
          want me.

                    PETER
          I need her; she's a cop.  I have to
          kill a cop, and then...

                    HELEN
          You've been perfect.  Don't spoil
          the symmetry -- you have to have a
          male cop.

                    PETER
          I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's
          the important thing.  Cop-ness, not
          sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but
          it'll be good.

               (yells)
          Call Quinn and Saks.

                    PETER
          I'm tired.  I want it to end
          tonight, don't you?

                    HELEN
          Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now.
          Let her go.  I'll come -- just let
          her go.  She's not important.

                    PETER
          You know where.

                    HELEN
          Where it began -- McCluskey
          Auditorium.

     He hangs up.

     INSERT: TAPE MONITOR.  WE HEAR HELEN HANGING UP.  A SMALL
     COMPUTER CHIP VOICE IS HEARD.  THE FBI MAN IS MEASURING
     SUGAR INTO HIS COFFEE AT THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM.  HE CAN'T
     HEAR:

     BATHROOM DRAWER

     It is pulled open: metallic sounds of  bullets rolling on the
     wooden drawer: her hand bats away the usual bathroom drawer
     garbage and pull Ruben's gun out; HER TREMBLING FINGERS
     RELOAD IT.

     EXT. HELEN'S OUTSIDE HALL - NIGHT

     Helen wearing loose coat, jeans and sneakers opens the door.
     FRED snaps out of a sound sleep.

                    HELEN
          It's all over, Fred.  They got the
          guy.  You go home to your own bed
          now.

                    FRED
          I got to have that from my
          superior.  One guy fired off this
          job already.

                    HELEN
          Call in.  Use my phone.  They'll
          tell you -- it's all over.

     FRED GOES.  HELEN STEPS RESOLUTELY INTO THE HALL, FOR
     REASSURANCE BRACES HERSELF WITH A HAND ON THE WALL.

     THE HALLWAY (HER POV).  IT SEEMS MILES LONG.  SOUND: HER
     FRONT DOOR CLICKING SHUT -- THE SAME ESSENTIAL EVENT AS SO
     LONG AGO WHEN RUBEN HAD TO SHOOT OFF THE DOOR LOCK...

     HELEN LOOKS BACK AT THE DOOR.  BRIDGES BURNED.  TURNS BACK.

     HER HAND ON WALL: AS SHE MOVES A TENTATIVE STEP HER HAND
     PRESSES HEAVILY, SLIDING ALONG THE WALL.  THEN HER HAND
     MOVES A LITTLE FASTER, AND FASTER.

     HER POV.  THE HALL SEEMS MORE NORMAL.  MOVING SHOT PICKS UP
     SPEED...

     HER HAND NOW BRUSHES THE WALL WITH ONLY FINGERTIPS.

     HELEN MOVES WITH MORE AND MORE CONFIDENCE: HER AGORAPHOBIA
     IS GONE... HER HAND DROPS TO HER SIDE...

     EXT. HER BUILDING - NIGHT

     The door opens and Helen appears in it.  She confronts the
     street and the night... One more threshold to cross...

     STREET: HER OLD SAAB IS PARKED.  THE ANTENNA IS GONE, AND
     IT'S COVERED WITH CITY GRIME.  The night seems to roar; the
     lights blur and flare.  A truck comes past too fast, 
     stirring up dust and buffeting her with wind.

     HELEN steeling herself and running the few steps to her car.

     INT. CAR as she slides into the driver's seat, slamming the
     door and locking it.  She drives off into the night.

     EXT. MULUSKEY AUDITORIUM -  NIGHT

     A broad view through shadowy trees shows it's lighted
     facade.  Parked in front of is M.J.'s car.  SUDDENLY FROM
     BEHIND THE TREES, SAKS STEPS OUT IN FRONT, BLOCKING THE WAY!

     REVERSE:  HELEN'S CAR IS COMING UP THE STREET TOWARDS US.
     SAKS (AND NOW WE SEE OTHER SWAT TYPES IN THE SHADOWS, HIDDEN
     FROM THE VIEW OF THE AUDITORIUM) STANDS IN THE STREET
     FLAGGING HER DOWN --

     SHE STOPS, PUTTING DOWN WINDOW.  SAKS RESTS HIS HAND ON THE
     DOOR... He shoves no sign of recognizing her...

                    SAKS
          Ma'am, please get out of your
          vehicle...

                    HELEN
          Merry, how... oh, Christ, of
          course, you had my phone tapped.

                    SAKS
          Just get out of your vehicle...

                    HELEN
          He's got Sergeant Halloran in
          there.  He'll kill her the minute
          he sees or hears your people...

                    SAKS
          You've been very useful, Doctor, we
          appreciate all you've done, and now
          the professional will take over...

                    HELEN
          He wants me, he doesn't care about
          her.  Let me...

     SAKS HAS THE DOOR OPEN AND IS REACHING TO PULL HER FROM THE
     DRIVER'S SEAT... HELEN SUCKS IN HER BREATH AND JAMS ON THE
     GAS.  SAKS IS ALMOST DRAGGED AWAY WITH HER, SPUN AROUND AND
     FALLING ON THE PAVEMENT.  SHE SLAMS THE DOOR AS SHE SPEEDS
     TOWARD THE AUDITORIUM...

     SAKS, CURSING, LEAPS TO HIS FEET; A SWAT TYPE AIMS HIS GUN
     AFTER HELEN, BUT SAKS PUTS HIS HAND ON THE WEAPON STOPPING
     HIM FROM SHOOTING.

     NEW ANGLE: Helen's Saab speeds out of the tree shadowed
     street into the bright plaza in front of the auditorium, and
     brakes behind M.J.'s car.

     CLOSE: HELEN.  Sudden silence when she kills the car engine.
     She gets out of the car.  As she walks even her sneakers
     make an echo from the silent stone facade... She walks up
     the wide stairs...

     INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

     The huge doors creak open and Helen enters.  She stands,
     listening: light streams in from the exterior through tall
     windows, otherwise it's all back shadows, weird enough
     without the distorted vision, the vertigo that momentarily
     returns...

     Helen wills herself to move into the deep space before her.
     She stands listening: we HEAR the creaks and tiny snaps of a
     building cooling in the night air.  Or is the movement of
     Peter somewhere in the room?

     She whirls to face a distance sound that echoes in the
     auditorium...

     CLOSE: HELEN staring, trying to SEE.  NOTHING.

     THEN:

     PETER IS STARING BACK.  HIS FACE BECOMES DARYLL LEE.  THE
     VISION SNAPS.

     HELEN: SHE TURNS AND WALKS PAST THE ROSTRUM OF THE STAGE TO
     A DOOR UPSTAGE LEFT... OPENING INTO A LONG AND DARK
     CORRIDOR.  SHE GROPES FOR LIGHT SWITCHES, CAN'T FIND OUT ANY.
     THE CORRIDOR LEADS TO THE LADIES' ROOM ON THE RIGHT.  AS SHE
     WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY, IT BEGINS TO RESEMBLE TO HER THE
     SAME WALK SHE TOOK AT THE BEGINNING: AND SUDDENLY AT THE
     DOOR TO THE LADIES' ROOM SHE SEEMS TO SEE THE FAT COP.  SHE
     SHAKES HER HEAD AND THE VISION IS GONE.

     REPLACED BY INT. LADIES' ROOM.  THE COP IS NOW HELD FROM
     BEHIND BY DARYLL LEE - SMILING AT HELEN.  IN REVERSE, WE SEE
     FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT HELEN HAS THE ROPE WELL AWAY FROM
     HER NECK.  WE REALIZE SHE HAS AMPLE TIME TO WARN THE COP,
     BUT SHE IS PARALYZED, FASCINATED BY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
     TERRIBLE SLOW MOTION INTERCUTS BETWEEN DARYLL LEE GRINNING
     AT HER, HELEN'S HELPLESS HORROR, THE COP'S APPEALING LOOK TO
     HER AND BACK TO DARYLL LEE AS (BELOW THE FRAME) HE SLITS THE
     COP'S THROAT AND LETS HIM FALL TO THE FLOOR.

     HELEN (FLASHBACK) AT LAST BEGINS TO SCREAM!

     CLOSE: HELEN (PRESENT) RECOVERING.  (SHE HASN'T SCREAMED AT
     ALL.)  SHE PULLS RUBEN'S GUN FROM HER POCKET AND SHOVES OPEN
     THE DOOR INTO THE LADIES' ROOM.

     AS THE DOOR OPENS.  THE LIGHTS ARE ON: IT IS BRILLIANT,
     BLINDING IN HERE.  SHE STEPS IN.  THERE IS A SOUND THAT
     DRAWS HER ROUND, HER GUN COMING UP: BACK OF THE DOOR IS THE
     BROOM CLOSET... SHE FIRES TWO ROUNDS INTO THE CLOSET DOOR.
     IT SPRINGS OPEN AND MOPS AND PAILS FALL THUNDEROUSLY OUT
     ONTO THE TILE FLOOR.

     SHE WHIRLS TO COVER HER BACK; FACES THE STALLS.

     EXT. SAKS' ROADBLOCK - NIGHT

     THEY REACT TO ECHOES OF THE GUNFIRE.

                    SWAT
          Oh, man?!  Let us in there.

                    SAKS
          Go.  Go.  Go!

     Men begin moving cautiously out of the trees and shadows
     toward the Auditorium...

     INT. LADIES' ROOM

     HELEN MOVES ALONG THE STALLS PUSHING DOORS OPEN.  UNTIL SHE
     SHOVES ONE OPEN AND SEES:

     M.J. IS HANGING BY A NOOSE, DANGLING THE SAME WAY HELEN DID
     IN THE OPENING SEQUENCE.  SHE IS ALIVE, HOLDING THE NOOSE
     FROM HER NECK BY ONE HAND...

     HELEN STARTS TO RUSH TO HER ASSISTANCE, WHEN THE LIGHTS GO
     OUT.  PETER TAKES HER FROM BEHIND, SWIFTLY DISARMING HER,
     REGARDING THE GUN WITH AMAZEMENT.

                    PETER
          You cheated!  You said you'd come
          die with me.

     WITHOUT PAUSE HE PUMPS TWO BULLETS INTO M.J. WHERE SHE
     HANGS.  HER BODY JUMPS FROM THE IMPACT OF THE BULLETS, HER
     HEAD FLIES BACK AND SHE SLUMPS, THE NOOSE TIGHTENS; THE DOOR
     OF THE STALL SWINGS SLOWLY SHUT, AS PETER TURNS ON HELEN,
     WHERE SHE LIES ON THE FLOOR, HORROR-STRUCK.

     EXT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

     WITH EFFICIENCY AND CAUTION FBI SWAT TYPES MOVE TOWARD THE
     AUDITORIUM.  A GRAPPLING HOOK IS THROWN HIGH OVER THE ROOF;
     THEY PREPARE FOR AN ASSAULT.  A HELICOPTER SWOOPS IN, BATHING
     THE SCENE IN ITS BRILLIANT LIGHT...

     INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - NIGHT

     PETER HAS HELEN ON THE STAGE WHERE CHAIRS ARE RANDOMLY
     SCATTERED AND PUSHED HER TO A SEAT FACING HIM, ALMOST KNEE
     TO KNEE... HELEN WILL USE HER PSYCHOLOGICAL WILES TO TRY TO
     TAKE AWAY PETER'S CONTROL OF THE SITUATION... PETER LOOKS UP
     AT THE SOUND... HE IS PROUD AND THRILLED.

                    PETER
          Listen to them!  We'll be on all
          three channels.

                    HELEN
          Kill me, Peter, do it, now.

                    PETER
          No.  Not yet.

                    HELEN
          Do it.  If that's what all this
          carnage is about, then do it.  Have
          enough guts to do it.

                    PETER
          Don't talk to me about courage.  I
          know death, what it's like to kill.
          You're not a killer -- you watched
          Daryll Lee kill that cop and you
          didn't make a peep, because you
          were paralyzed with fear.  You
          chocked.  I know something else about
          you.

     Peter is jerking about with amphetamine energy; he pops a
     pill into his mouth and swallows...

                    PETER
          You want one?  No?  There was
          something in you that was
          fascinated, that wanted to see what
     it was like for a man to die.
          Everybody feels it.  Like every
          person who slows to see a bad
          accident, or runs to see a fire.
          That's true.  I see it in you...
          you're the same as me.

     THERE IS NOISE OUTSIDE... LIKE SOMEONE BREAKING IN.

                    PETER
          Oh, no.

     HE GRABS HER, AND SHE MOVES WITH HIM, WITHOUT RESISTANCE, AS
     HE TURNS OUT THE LIGHTS INSIDE.

     FLOODLIGHTS SUDDENLY ILLUMINATE THE FACADE OUTSIDE,
     INCREASING THE BRILLIANCE OF THE LIGHT STREAMING IN AND
     DARKENING THE SHADOWS FURTHER.  GERMAN EXPRESSIONISM.

     He leads her back to the stage... he pushes her into a chair
     facing him... He looks into her face and smiles...

                    PETER
          We'll keep talking.  Until they get
          here.  Then...
               (smiles)

                    HELEN
          I have no life anymore.  I ruined
          your life, make me pay for it.

                    PETER
          Why did you do that?  Didn't you
          have any idea how hard it was for
          me, to get that far?  I worshipped
          you.  You inspired me.  I thought
          you could understand me the way you
          understood the others.  I knew that
          about you -- the ones you admired
          were the great murderers; they
          fascinated you.

                    HELEN
          That's not who I admire -- I admire
          people who are good at what they
          do, great artists, writers,
          thinkers...

                    PETER
          I don't have the talent for any of
          those things.  All I have a talent
          for is death.  And I am one of a
          kind.  What do you think of your
          student now?  I have made you
          famous, I am your creation and your
          monument.

     BEHIND HIM A SHADOWY FIGURE DARTS FROM HIDING SPOT TO A
     VANTAGE POINT: WE CAN'T MAKE OUT THE FIGURE... HELEN SEES
     BUT PETER DOES NOT.

                    HELEN
          If you let me, I can make you more
          famous than any of them.

                    PETER
          Oh, please.  I know what's coming,
          now.  "Let me help you..."

                    HELEN
          Do anything you want to me.  I give
          myself to you.  Only put the knife
          down.  Isn't this what you always
          wanted?  I know it's what we all
          want, to love and to loved.  I
          could love you.  You could work
          together in some safe place, learn
          to really understand you, help you,
          give you some peace of mind, some
          happiness...

                    PETER
          Back in the driver's seat again,
          Doctor?  That old dream -- study us
          to see what makes us sick.  So you
          can find a cure -- they'd name it
          after you?  Death is the only cure
          for people like me.

     He leans toward her with the knife.  This might be the
     moment.  His gun lies on the floor beside him.

     HER EYES HAVE FLICKED TO THE SHADOW BEHIND HIM; HE SEES IT
     AND STOOPS TO PICK UP THE GUN AND FIRES INTO THE SHADOWS,
     TWO OR THREE QUICK ROUNDS.  HE TURNS BACK TO HELEN, DROPPING
     THE GUN TO REACH FOR THE KNIFE.

     HELEN HEAD BUTTS HIM WITH ASTONISHING STRENGTH, KNOCKING HIM
     BACKWARD.  SHE STANDS... HE COMES UP WITH GUN... AND AIMS AT
     HER...

     BEHIND HIM M.J. STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS HAVING NOW A CLEAN
     SHOT.

     HELEN DOESN'T GIVE A CLUE, JUST LOOKS INTO PETER'S EYES AS
     M.J. AND PETER IN SLOW MOTION DETAILS AS SHE LINES UP HER
     SHOT: SHE COULD KILL HIM OR GO FOR THE EXPOSED SHOULDER.

                    HELEN
          Do it.  For God's sake, now...

     M.J. FIRES.

     PETER IS SPUN AWAY FROM HELEN BY THE IMPACT, STANDS THERE,
     SHAKING WITH THE SHOCK OF THE HIT... HE STARES AT HER.

                    PETER
               (surprised, like a
                child)
          You hurt me!

     M.J. HOLDS HER GUN ON HIM, READY TO SHOOT AGAIN, BUT HE JUST
     GOES DOWN ON ONE KNEE, HIS BODY VIOLENTLY SHUDDERING... AS:

     THERE IS A HUGE SOUND OF BREAKING GLASS AND THEN AN ENORMOUS
     EXPLOSION THAT THROWS THEM TO THE GROUND.

     THE BIG FRONT DOORS ARE BLASTED OPEN, AND THE FLAK VESTED
     SWAT TEAM SWARMS THROUGH... SMOKE FROM THE CONCUSSION
     GRENADE SWIRLS IN THE CHIAROSCURO OF FLOODLIGHTS AND
     SHADOWS.

     OUT OF THE SMOKE COME SKI-MASKED SWAT MEN...

                    M.J. & HELEN
          No!!

     PETER TURNS TO THE SWAT TEAM, OFFERING HIMSELF, AS THE WOMEN
     SCREAM TO THE SWAT MEN'S WOUNDED AND HARMLESS...

     A PATTERN OF RED DOTS FROM LASER BEAM SIGHTS ON THE SWAT
     TEAM RIFLES DAPPLE PETER'S HEAD AND TORSO.

     SWAT TEAM

     LIKE A FIRING SQUAD THE TEAM FIRES.

     PETER'S BODY FLIES THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE IMPACT AND
     SLIDES SPRAWLING ACROSS THE STAGE TO A STOP.

                                   CUT TO:

     INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

     M.J. SITS AS PARAMEDIC GENTLY PULL OFF HER SHIRT AND THE
     BULLET PROOF VEST THAT SAVED HER LIFE.

                    M.J.
          Jesus that hurts.  You think the
          rib is busted?

                    PARAMEDIC
          That looks like just a bad bruise.
          I'll tape it up if you want to...

                    M.J.
          I'll take some Tylenol and codeine,
          instead, how about a lot of number
          six?

     The medic turns to his medicine bag.  Cops swarm around
     them.  Helen sits down next to M.J.  M.J. begins to put on
     her shirt, wincing at the movement.  Helen helps her.

                    M.J.
               (it hurts)
          Oh, God.

     SAKS AND QUINN EMERGE THROUGH THE CHIAROSCURO OF SMOKE AND
     LIGHT AND SHADOW.  When M.J. sees him she takes out her gun
     and hands it to him.  It is what he expects, but she
     misunderstands -- she is offering it to him as her
     resignation from the cops.  He takes it only as a part of
     officer related shooting routine.  SHE LOOKS INTO HIS FACE
     AS HE SMELLS THE MUZZLE, KNOWS SHE FIRES IT, APPROVED.

                    QUINN
          I'll take it, kid.  You take two
          weeks paid leave.  Don't waste a
          second thinking about that shitbag.
          Then come back.  You're a cop, M.J.

     He nods to Helen...

                    QUINN (cont'd)
          Get the civilians outta here.

                    M.J.
          She's in no shape to give her
          statement tonight...

                    QUINN
          No, she can come in tomorrow...
          gonna want to know a lot of
          things...

     B.G. the cops have pulled PETER'S BODY BY THE FEET, LETTING
     HIM BUMPITY BUMPITY BUMPITY DOWN THE STEPS from the stage
     and lifted him onto a gurney.  The body is wheeled past
     them, as...

                    HELEN
          The only one who could tell you
          what you really need to know is
          dead.

                    QUINN
          Yeah, it's a thought...

     Of no importance to him, he turns away...

     INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

     In the LOBBY area between the auditorium proper and the big
     exterior doors (now the worse for wear from the concussion
     grenades).  Outside, through the glass we SEE a media circus
     under the BRIGHT LIGHTS put up for the assault.  M.J. and
     HELEN SQUINT AGAINST THE LIGHT, AND TURN...

     THE AUDITORIUM (POV).

     The cops and technicians are working away; at one side is a
     small door -- easy escape.  They run toward it...

     EXT. MCCLUSKEY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

     It is dark where they step out into the night.  Around the
     corner of the building we see the light from the MEDIA
     CIRCUS.  THEN HELEN STEPS OFF DOWN INTO THE DARK CAMPUS.
     M.J. LOOKS AT HER: REALIZING: HELEN IS NO LONGER AFRAID.
     SHE CATCHES UP TO HER.  HOLD ON THEIR BACKS AS THEY WALK
     AWAY...

                    M.J.
          You could use a long hot bath, you
          know that?  You better get somebody
          to drive you home.

                    HELEN
          Why can't I drive home?  I will.
          You.  Look at you.  You need a ride
          home.  And you don't even know it.

                    M.J.
               (beat)
          Well, thanks.

     The two women continue down toward Helen's car, just outside
     the circle of media.  CAMERA RISES AND RISES TO A HIGH FULL
     SHOT.

     THE MOUTH AND THE HAIRCUT spot them and race toward them.

                    SUSAN
