INT. UNEMPLOYMENT BUREAU - DAY

ON A WOODEN SIGN HANGING FROM THE CEILING. IT READS:

Metropolis Unemployment Bureau

PAN DOWN TO A ROW OF "TELLERS' CAGES" with long lines of PEOPLE waiting to 
collect their unemployment checks. A sign above the first window says "A - F", 
the second window is designated "G - L" and so on.

CLOSE ON THE SECOND WINDOW --  Waiting his turn at the head of the line is a 
BLACK MAN in his early 30's. He kills time by trying to make a beat-up old 
wooden yo-yo perform the basic up-and-down maneuver, but he's not very good at 
it. He looks as if he's down on his luck: shiny pants, slightly frayed collar, 
an old windbreaker. One of life's chronic losers, he is one of those individuals 
who continue to believe in themselves despite overwhelming evidence to the 
contrary. This is GUS GORMAN.

Behind the teller's wicket is a middle-aged female CLERK with the requisite 
officious manner and heart of stone common to her profession. As the MAN ahead 
of GUS finishes his turn and walks away, she barks out:

                         CLERK
                    Name?

                         GUS
                          (as he tries to 
                           untangle his 
                           yo-yo string)
                    Gus Gorman.

She pulls his folder from her file, opens it, scowling.

                         CLERK
                    Ah yes, August Gorman. Have 
you looked for work this week, 
Mr. Gorman?

                         GUS
                          (this is a familiar
                            routine to him)
                    Yeah.

                         CLERK
                    What kind?

                         GUS
                    Kitchen. . . Technician

                         CLERK
                    Dishwasher? Any luck?

                         GUS
                    Nope, but --

                         CLERK
                    Mr. Gorman, according to our
                    records you have been unemployed
                    for 36 weeks.

                         GUS
                    Thirty-five.

                         CLERK
                    Not counting this week.
                           (looking at his folder)
                    You secured employment last June
                    as a messenger and were discharged
                    after one day for. . . 

                         GUS
                    They said I lost it on the subway, but
                    it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket
                    took it!

                         CLERK
                    A television set?

                         GUS
                    Well, it was one of them little bitty
                    two-inch screen Japanese jobs.

                         CLERK
                    The only other employment you 
                    found was in a fast-food joint--
                         (consulting dossier)
                    -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well!
                    That's some kind of record. Talk about
                    fast!

                         GUS
                          (protesting)
                    Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect 
                    you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold 
                    the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! 
                    Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody 
                    found no meat inside that glop yet.

                         CLERK
                    Mr. Gorman, the city of Metropolis is
                    generous to a fault, but. . . 

                         GUS
                    I know, I'm the fault.

                         CLERK
                    Thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment,
                    thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of
                    hard-working citizens. Do you know what
                    you are?

                         GUS
                    Don't call me a bum! I ain't no bum!

                         CLERK
                    You are, I was about to say, no longer
                    eligible.

                         GUS
                          (stunned)
                    What about this week's check?

                         CLERK
                          (dismissing him summarily
                    Next!

The MAN behind him steps up to the counter as a frustrated, miserable GUS walks 
away. FOLLOW GUS. Muttering to himself about the injustice of it all, he starts 
for the exit, feeling in his pocket for his cigarettes. he takes out a crumpled 
pack, pries the paper open and fishes out his last smoke. . . a bent, shabby-
looking cigarette. He puts the sorry object in his lips and searched his pockets 
for a match. No luck.

NEW ANGLE -- He walks over to a MAN waiting on one of the lines, smoking a 
cigar.

                         GUS
                    Hey brother, got a match?

The MAN hands him a matchbook. GUS takes it and is about to open it and light 
his cigarette, when the printing on the matchbook catches his eye. He looks 
closely at it.

INSERT - TIGHT POV: One of those matchbook advertisements for a home-study 
course. There is a little line drawing of a smiling, successful man, and the 
sell line:

"EARN BIG MONEY.
BECOME A COMPUTER PROGRAMMER"

HOLD ON THIS TIGHT C.U. OF THE MATCHBOOK AND FREEZE FRAME.
Music:          The stirring Superman theme begins.

THE TITLES OF THE MOVIE APPEARS SUPERIMPOSED OVER THESE IMAGES.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. METROPOLIS STREETS - DAY

(NOTE: The following sequence, which occurs during, under, and with CREDITS is 
designed as an elaborate, spectacular series of events based on the Rube-
Goldberg principle, i.e., a serial development of cause-and-effect, escalating 
in scope and size. The "gimmick" that further marks this sequence is as follows:

At the moment when each new development of "effect" is just about to manifest 
itself, the FRAME FREEZES and the next CREDIT (actors, composer, writers, 
director, etc.) appears. Then the FRAME UNFREEZES, the inevitable action takes 
place, leading to the next event in the chain of cause-and-effect until that 
perfect next moment comes when again there is a FREEZE FRAME, a CREDIT, and so 
on.

In the following, we have refrained from indicating exactly where each FREEZE 
FRAME and CREDIT should be, as that is more precisely discovered in the editing 
process. Thus:)

ESTABLISHING SHOT -- The busy streets of Metropolis on a typical weekday 
morning. Hustle and bustle, PEDESTRIANS and vehicles. It's nine-o'clock and 
people are on their way to work. As theme music continues, the sequence begins.

1.     Coming out the front door of a building is an absolute knockout of a GIRL: 
voluptuous, sexy, young, and healthy. Her every step casues a series of mind-
boggling ripples. She is seemingly oblivious to the effect she has on passers-
by. About 25 years old, this is somebody we will be seeing much more of later. 
LORELEI AMBROSIA.

2.     As she walks AWAY FROM CAMERA, her rear end reminding us of the proverbial  
puppies fighting in a sack, a GUY walking down the street from the opposite 
direction turns to ogle at her and therefore doesn't look where he's going. He 
bumps into a table-top tray of  TOY WIND-UP PENGUINS being sold by a VENDOR. The 
PENGUINS, about 20 of them, go waddling off in different directions up and down 
the street.

3.     A split-second later, a MAN IN A CAP, also walking in the opposite 
direction, comes abreast of LORELEI, turns to look at her, doesn't see that 
right in front of him (he's near the curb) is a street-sign post. He slams into 
it face first.

4. Clutching his smashed nose, he recoils backwards with a great lurch, banging 
full-
force into a GIRL ON ROLLER SKATES.

5.     Knocked off balance, wobbling erratically, she swerves and srashes into a 
hot dog wagon on the corner of the street. Standing there, buying a morning 
snack, is the DAILY PLANET photographer and cub reporter JIMMY OLSEN, on his way 
to the office. The HOT DOG VENDOR has put a frank on a bun and os about to 
squirt the mustard on it when the ROLLER SKATER crashes into the hot dog wagon. 
The mustard squirts on Jimmy's face instead and the wagon goes rolling away with 
considerable momentum. 

6.     On the corner of the next street are three telephone booths, side by side. 
In each booth is a CALLER. The LAST CALLER, A WOMAN, holds onto a leash, which 
dangles outside her phone booth. On the end of this leash is a LITTLE DOG, 
waiting patiently outside while his mistress talks on the phoneinside. The hot 
dog wagon, picking up speed, hits the first phone booth with considerable 
impact.

7. Causing a domino effect: the first booth tips over, with the GUY still inside 
it. and hits the second booth, tipping it and its OCCUPANT over, and that in 
turn knocks over the third booth, causing the LADY inside to lose her grip on 
the leash. Immediately the LITTLE DOG, startled by the crash, goes charging off 
down the street, trailing his leash.

8. Further down the street is a BLIND MAN holding the handle of the harness 
attached to his SEEING-EYE DOG stands in a doorway. As the LITTLE DOG comes 
running by, the SEEING-EYE DOG gets excited and pulls free of his MASTER, 
chasing the other DOG. Startled, the BLIND MAN staggers out into the street, 
feeling for his DOG, just as:



9. A AWHITE-LINE ROAD PAINTER workman is coming down the avenue, holding the 
handle of his motorized line-painting machine, which he is guiding precisely 
down the center of the street, painting, AS WE SEE a straight white line. He is 
distracted by the CHARGING DOGS and lets go of his machine momentarily. A moment 
later, the BLIND MAN staggers out into the road, reaches out and grasps what 
feels exactly like the handle of his Seeing-eye Dog harness. It ain't. It's the 
line-painting machine.

10. Which now continues down the road guided by a BLIND MAN, and the white line 
being painted curves, zig-zags, and bends so that any motorist trying to follow 
it would go berserk.

11. In the meantime, strolling down a side-street, with the characteristically 
springing step, affable smile for the world, neat suit, hat, and glasses comes 
none other than CLARK KENT. He suddenly jumps back as the LITTLE DOG comes 
whizzing by and instinctively reaches down with super-speed to grab the leash. 
This he does, but if the leash stops, the DOG doesn't. Instead the leash pulls 
free of the collar, leaving a bemused CLARK standing there holding an empty 
leash.

12. The DOGS whiz by the MAN IN THE CAP (fellow who keeps banging into things 
and getting hurt). As he leaps back to avoid them, he falls into an open 
manhole.

13. In the middle of the street, the white-line maker "guided" by the BLIND MAN, 
is heading for the area of the street where the open manhole is. The BLIND MAN 
loses control of the white-line painter and is about to step into the open hole, 
when:

14. The now-capless bald head of the MAN IN THE CAP emerges from the manhole, 
just in time for the BLIND MAN to step right on it (like     a man crossing a 
pond by stepping on the stones). The BLIND MAN, busy whistling for his missing 
dog, never noticed how near to disaster he came, but the bald head of the poor 
MAN IN THE CAP is now imprinted with a black sole marl.

15. The white-line roller, with nobody steering it, crashes into a little 
barrier that has been set up on the other side of the open manhole. Customary 
smudge pots mark the barrier. The white-line roller hits a smudge pot.

16. The smudge pot goes rolling across the gutter, stops. From another direction 
comes one of those TOY PENGUINS. It hits the smudge pot and is immediately set 
on fire by the flame.

17. The now flaming PENQUIN continues walking across the street, towards a 
newspaper stand. Stacked on the curb beside it are a bundle of as-yet-unopened 
newspapers. The burning toy comes to a stop against the stack, which begins to 
smoulder.

18. Further down the street is a bank. And just at this moment, running out of 
the bank, a gun in one hand, a sack of stolen money in the other, comes a BANK 
ROBBER. A BANK GUARD races from the bank and gives chase. The BANK ROBBER 
doesn't see:

19. A MAN removing a ladder (the kind which hooks onto clamps from the side of a 
van truck). As the MAN and ladder turn, the ladder hook grabs the ROBBER'S 
hands. The MAN WITH THE LADDER, never realizing what he has done, swings round 
180 degrees with the ladder and the money bag is pulled off the ladder by:

20. The wires of a scaffold where some BUILDING REPAIRMEN stand, just about to 
go up the side of a building. A second after the sack is deposited on the 
platform, the scaffold starts to rise.

21. The BANK GUARD fires at the ROBBER, but his shot misses and hits the 
windshield of a passing car. The windshield shatters and the DRIVER crashes into 
a fire hydrant on the curb.

22. Water gushes out of the hydrant, filling up the interior of the car like a 
goldfish bowl, the DRIVER trapped inside.

23. Across the street, the flaming newspapers have set the entire kiosk on fire.

24. Hearing the screams and shouts, CLARK KENT looks down the street and sees 
what's happening. Quickly, he looks around for a place to metamorphose sees 
none.

25. HE dashes down the street, pausing for a regretful look at the three phone 
booths on their sides (no way for him there). He spots an open storefront with 
one of those Photomat Booths inside, enters it, behind the curtain. We hear a 
coin drop in the slot; the OCCUPIED sign goes on; the lights flash. A moment 
later, bursting out of the booth. . . SUPERMAN!

26. He's just about to take off, when he does an "Oops!" as he remembers: the 
four photos drop into the receptacle. AS he turns to go back and get them, a KID 
wanders by and SUPERMAN grabs them out of his hand. ON THE PHOTOS: They show the 
change. PHOTO 1" Clark.  2. Clark with glasses off, shirt unbuttoned. 3. Further 
along. 4. SUPERMAN. Quickly he tears off the fourth picture and hands it to the 
astonished KID.

27. SUPERMAN lands on top of the car . . . now totally filled with water. 
Quickly, he rips open the sun roof, reaches inside and hauls the soggy DRIVER 
out. Then, jumping to the ground, he lifts the car off the hydrant, sets it 
down, then jams the broken hydrant back into the sidewalk, thereby stopping the 
gushing water.

28. Across the street, the kiosk is engulfed in flames. SUPERMAN lifts the car, 
flies across the street with it and turns it upside down over the fire. The 
water gushes out and douses the flames.

29. JIMMY OLSEN, watching from the sidewalk, sheers:

JIMMY
                    Way to go, Superman!

30. Up high on the outside of the building, the WORKERS on the scaffold turn to 
look 
down at what's happening on the street. ONE OF THEM kicks the sack of money over 
the side as he turns to look.

31. In the playground of the park on the next street, a YOUNG MOTHER (or a 
NANNY) lifts a little TODDLER from a baby carriage and sets him on one of end of 
a see-saw. Now she starts to walk around it to the other end so that she can 
give the little fellow a gentle see-saw ride. But before she gets there, the 
falling money bag lands full force on the (up) end of the see-saw.

32. Which causes the other end to fly upwards, catapulting the TODDLER straight 
up in the air. The YOUNG MOTHER screams.

33. The BABY lands in the topmost branches of a tree and howls.

34. SUPERMAN sees the problem, flies down and rescues the TODDLER. He hands him 
to the YOUNG MOTHER and flies off.

35. THE TWO PAINTERS are on a scaffold, about two stories up on the side of a 
building. One of them turns abruptly as he spots SUPERMAN flying by:

FIRST PAINTER
                       (to CO-WORKER)
                    Mike, looks who's here!

     And as he turns, he inadvertently licks over one can of paint on its side, 
Paint slowly 
starts to drip out and over the side.

36. QUICK PAN DOWN TO STREET LEVEL BELOW WHERE WE LOOK through 
the window of a posh Art Gallery. Inside, a DIGNIFIED GENTLEMAN is paying a 
large sum of money to the OWNER as his purchase, a large oil painting in gilt 
frame, is being moved toward the door by the GALLERY WORKERS.

37. The DIGNIFIED GENTLEMAN exits the gallery first. As he steps out, the first 
drops of paint from the tipped-over paint can above starts to fall. He 
automatically opens his umbrella at the first sign of falling moisture.

38. After a pause, there seems to be no more precipitation. He closes up his 
umbrella. A second later, the entire can of paint falls on his head.

39. He reels backwards from the blow and crashes into a penny gumball machine on 
the sidewalk (outside an adjacent candy store).

40. The gumball machine crashes to the ground, the glass globe breaks and a 
hundred little gumballs roll onto the sidewalk.

41. Way down the street, the BANK ROBBER is fleeing from the pursuing BANK 
GUARD, constantly looking over his shoulder to see if he's gaining on him.

42. On the other side of the art gallery, PATRONS in a sidewalk café are being 
entertained by one of those STREET PERFORMERS seen everywhere lately . . . a 
second-rate Marcel Marceau, i.e. a white-faced, black leotard-garbed MIME. The 
MIME is doing the classic routine of a man climbing a hill against a strong 
wind. He doesn't see the gumballs rolling toward him until it is too late. 
Desperately trying to maintain his routine, his feet start going out of control, 
faster and faster. he loses balance completely and falls ungracefully on his 
ass.

43. The BANK ROBBER dashes down the street, COPS giving chase, and trips on the 
fallen MIME. The sudden halting of his rapid forward motion sends him falling 
straight forward just as:

44. The oil painting is being carried out of the gallery to a nearby car. The 
BAN KROBBER goes head-first right through the painting.

45. On the other side of the painting, a TEENAGER dribbling a basketball is 
knocked down by the ROBBER. The basketball bounces and goes flying through the 
air.

46. It lands in the cooker of a Hot Fog Wagon, which has finally come to a stop 
against the side of a building. The heat causes the basketball to swell . . . 
and swell . . .

47. CLARK KENT, in civvies again, comes out of a doorway.

48. ON THE BASKETBALL which swells to the bursting point and explodes. Pieces of 
rubber and strings of hot-dogs go flying into the air.

49. On street level, LORELEI AMBROSIA comes jiggling down the street, still 
having no idea of the events she set in motion.

50. Ahead of her, halfway down the block, a panel truck, its doors open, is 
parked in front of a bakery. A DELIVERY MAN emerges from the bakery, carrying a 
tray of custard pies.

51. The bakery's DELIVERY MAN doesn't see the hot dogs rolling on the sidewalk. 
He steps on them, trips. This causes:

52. A custard pie to fly up into the air, heading right for the unsuspecting 
kisser of LORELEI, who is walking the other way.

53. CLARK spots what is about to happen and, with a very deft move, slides in 
front of the momentarily startled girl and, in the same motion, reaches one hand 
up and catches the pie neatly just when it was inches away from her face. Still 
in one smooth motion, CLARK whisks it away and out of sight like a very clever 
waiter, as LORELEI, who never noticed, continues on.

54. What CLARK doesn't notice, though, is the bruised battered MAN IN THE CAP 
who turns the corner exactly at this second and walks smack-on right into the 
custard pie in CLARK'' outstretched hand.

CLARK
                    Oh! Sorry about that.

55. As the MAN IN THE CAP stands there wiping pie off his face, CLARK steps to 
the 
curb and waits for the light to change so he can cross.

56. NEW ANGLE -- A big truck comes down the street. There's a large puddle on 
the gutter, the residue of an early morning rain. The curbside tires run through 
the water, causing it to splash CLARK. AS the big splash hits him, this is THE 
FINAL FREEZE FRAME and the FINAL (DIRECTOR'S) CREDIT.

ON CLARK -- He looks down in mild dismay. His pant legs are soaking wet. 
Quickly, he turns and walks into the park entrance. FOLLOW HIM as he sits down 
on an unoccupied bench. Trying not to call attention to himself, he opens his 
newspaper, pretends to read it. It is today's DAILY PLANET.

CLOSER ON CLARK -- He looks around to make sure nobody is noticing him. Nobody 
is. Satisfied, he raises his glasses and looks down at his wet pants.

EFFECTS:  The red rays of Heat Vision emanate from his eyes, aims at his pants 
as he extends his legs on the park bench. In a second, the pants are magically 
dries and re-pleated.


                    CLARK
                  (to himself)
               Neatness counts.

Satisfied, he continues to walk to work.

As CLARK walks OUT OF FRAME, PAN UP to the second floor of a small building, the 
kind where there's a store on the ground floor and a few offices above it. PAN 
STOPS on the window, on which is lettered:

ARCHIBALD DATA PROCESSING SCHOOL

INT. DATA PROCESSING SCHOOL ROOM - DAY

A bunch of students are clustered around INSTRUCTORS, who sits at the keyboard 
of a small computer, demonstrating.

                         FIRST STUDENT
                    But what if you want to program two
                    bilateral coordinates at the same time?

                         INSTRUCTOR
                    You can't. It's impossible.

                         FIRST STUDENT
                    Computer technology is quite advanced,
                    young man, but it can't do that.

A voice from the assembled students is heard:

                         VOICE
                         (hesitantly)
                    Uh. . . 

The GROUP parts to reveal GUS GORMAN. HE mumbles and reaches over to the 
keyboard. H punches some buttons while the INSTRUCTOR looks on with a 
patronizing smile. Suddenly the INSTUCTOR'S expression changes to one of 
astonishment.

                         INSTRUCTOR
                    Good Lord! How did you do that?

                         GUS
                          (shrugging)
                    Just did it, that's all.

EXT.  DAIILY PLANET - DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT of the office building.

INT.  PERRY WHITE'S OFFICE  -  DAY

INSERT --  On a 8 x 10 photograph laying on a desktop. It shows a handsome MAN 
in his mid-40's, wearing black tie, standing up at a formal dais table, holding 
a plaque. A captain of industry who has taken pains to present himself as a 
"regular guy," this is ROSS WEBSTER.

As CAMERA studies this photo, we hear the voice of PERRY WHITE asking:

                         PERRY (o.s.)
                    Who's this?

                         JIMMY (o.s.)
                    That's him, Ross Webster. This was just
                    after they presented him with the award
                    for Humanitarian of the Year.          

                         LOIS (o.s.)
                    Good-looking.

                         JIMMY (o.s.)
                    That's because I gave him f.2 at a 50th.

FULL SHOT  --  Three PEOPLE are in PERRY'S office, looking at photographs spread 
out on a table. Shirtsleeves rolled up, tie knot loosened -- that's PERRY WHITE. 
Surrounded by a great many shiny, chic shopping bags and looking particularly 
fetching and cheerful today is LOIS LANE. Displaying the photos is JIMMY OLSEN.

                         PERRY
                    Olsen, there's one thing I don't 
understand. The point of the story
Lois wrote is how the Ross Webster 
got this great honor. You bring me one 
photograph of him and fifteen pictures
of this person!

As he says this, he points to a bunch of other photos on the desk:

ON THE PHOTOS --  They are various shots of the same GIRL whose wiggle caused 
all the chaos on the streets before: LORELEI AMBROSIA. She is seated at the 
banquet dais in a low cut gown. As we SEE these, PERRY'S speech continues:

                         PERRY
                    Who is she?

                         JIMMY
                    Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's 
                    Webster's Girl Friday.

                         LOIS
                    Oh, I think Saturday, too.

NEW ANGLE -- As PERRY takes another photo from the pile and studies it.

                         PERRY
                    Who's the other woman?
                    
                         JIMMY
                    That's his sister. Vera Webster.


                         PERRY
                    The picture looks blurry.

                         LOIS
                    The picture's fine. That's the way
                    she looks in real life.

INSERT:  ON THE PHOTO -- Showing a no-nonsense, severe-looking woman in
her late 40's. This is Ross' older, spinster sister: Vera Webster.

                         JIMMY (o.s.)
                    She's vice-president of Webco
                    Industries.

ON THEM

                         PERRY
                    You're amazing, Olsen. A boring
                    banquet and you bring back 3,000
                    boring pictures. Then Superman puts
                    out a fire on Third Avenue this morning
                    and you stand there and watch the whole
                    thing and you don't take one picture!!

                         JIMMY
                    I didn't have my camera with me.

                         PERRY
                         (exasperated)
                    A photographer eats with his camera,
                    A Photographer sleeps with his camera --

                         LOIS
                    Glad I'm a writer.

At which point, the door opens and a grumpy, middle-aged WOMAN enters, pushing a 
bizarre object on wheels before her. The WOMAN is MISS HENDERSON from 
Circulation Department. The thing she pushes is one of those revolving drum 
Bingo machines with a hand crank on the side that turns a cog, which makes the 
hundreds of little white plastic balls churn about until one of them falls into 
the chute. Attached to it is a big promotional sign, which reads:

                    "JINGO! Daily Planet Big
                    Prize Bingo, by JINGO!!"

From this ANGLE we can SEE that in the adjacent office, behind the glass, is a 
bulletin board with JINGO written over it and a MAN waiting in there.








                         MISS HENDERSON
                    Mr. White, please, it's time for you
                    to draw this month's winning JINGO
                    number.
                          (to LOIS)
                    The prize is an all-expenses trip to 
                    South America.

                         PERRY
                          (irritated)
                    Why can't the idiot in Circulation who 
                    dreamed up this imbecile contest in the
                    first place ---

                         MISS HENDERSON
                    Because you're the Editor-in-Chief. Your
                    integrity is unquestioned.
                         LOIS
                    I have a question.

Suddenly coming through the door is CLARK KENT, almost tripping over the 
shopping bags around LOIS.

                         CLARK
                    Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got 
                    mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White,
                    I don't mean to interrupt but ---

                         PERRY
                    Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put
                    out a newspaper here.

And he starts cranking the Bingo machine.

                         LOIS
                    It'll never replace the printing press, 
boss.

     MISS HENDERSON
     (impatiently)
What's the number, Mr. White?

CLOSER ANGLE -- PERRY pries apart the plastic ball; it splits into two half-
spheres. Inside is a folded piece of paper. He removes it, unfolds it, reads it.

                         PERRY
                          (unenthusiastically)
                    53.

                         MISS HENDERSON
                           (calling out in piercing
                             tones to the next office)
                    53!


SEEN THROUGH THE GLASS DIVIDER" THE MAN in the next room tacks the number 53 up 
on the board.

                         PERRY
                    Okay? Goodbye.

                         MISS HENDERSON
                    You've got to pick three more numbers.

Furiously, PERRY starts to crank the machine again.

                         CLARK
                    Mr. White, please, I promised those people
                    I'd get back to them by this morning. What 
do you think?

     PERRY
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . 
     CLARK
       (pitching hard)
Personally, I think it could be a terrific
story!

C.U. LOIS -- Accusingly, as if she were being robbed of an assignment.

                         LOIS
                    What terrific story?

                         PERRY
                    Kent's been invited to his high-school
                    class reunion.

                         LOIS
                    Whoopee.

                         CLARK
                         (fired up)
                    It's practically an American ritual, 
Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?

     JIMMY
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the
people I went to high school with are still 
in high school.

     MISS HENDERSON
     (impatiently)
Could we have the next number already?

PERRY stops cranking, another ball falls out, and he opens it.

                         MISS HENDERSON
                           (hollering out)
                    33!

The GUY in the next room puts up 33.

                         CLARK
                           (won't be stopped)
                    Anyway, the reunion's just the hook
                    for the story. What it's really about is
                    how the typical small town's changed 
                    in the last fifteen years. how do you
                    like this a title: Can You Go Home 
Again ?

     LOIS
Say!

     CLARK
       (not picking up
        the put-on)
Take me, for instance. Going back to
middle America after having become
a Metropolis sophisticate --

C.U. LOIS -- She looks at CLARK fondly, but she can't quite buy that self-
description.

                         CLARK
                        (brightly)
                    I'm really excited about this. I even --

He opens his briefcase, pulls out a neatly folded maroon wool pullover.

                         CLARK
-- I was looking through my closet last
and, sure enough, O found my old
high school sweater.

FULL ON HIM as he unfolds it and holds it proudly in front of his chest. In the 
middle of it, right where the Superman monogram is located, is a big white block 
letter "S".

ON PERRY, LOIS AND JIMMY looking at him.

ON CLARK -- He points to the "S".

                         CLARK
                          (explaining)
                    Smallville.

NEW ANGLE

                         MISS HENDERSON
                            (whiney, nudging)
                    Mr. White!

Scowling like mad, PERRY cranks the handle again.



                         PERRY
                    I'm getting a cramp in my elbow 
                    from this.

                         CLARK
                           (helpfully as ever)
                    Let me do it for you, Mr. White.

With characteristic over-enthusiasm, CLARK starts to crank the handle too 
rapidly.

                         CLARK
                           (eagerly)
                    So, Mr. White? Can I go ahead and
                    make my travel arrangements?

                         LOIS
                    Exactly what I was about to ask 
                    about me.

Suddenly, the handle breaks off the drum due to CLARK'S over-exertion. He stands 
there with egg on his face and crank in hand.

                         MISS HENDERSON
                    Do you know what that machine cost?

                         CLARK
                    Uh. . . sorry --

                         PERRY
                    All right, Kent. I just hope you know what
                    you're doing. If you really think Smallville
                    is your big chance, go for it.

                         JIMMY
                    What about me?
     
                         PERRY
                    What about you?

                         JIMMY
                    A story like this cries out for great human
                    interest pictures.
                          (envisioning them)
                    The big dance! The Homecoming Game!          
                    Mr. Kent posing next to his old locker!

                         LOIS
                    Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that
                    one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use
                    black and white.

                         PERRY 
                    Okay, Kent, call your people and tell 
                    them the Prodigal Son is coming home.
FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but 
we continue to hear his voice, o.s. 

                         PERRY (o.s.)
                    I just hope you realize, it's not easy
                    losing my top reporter --

Beaming at the unexpected compliment, CLARK turns back just as:

FULL SHOT

                         PERRY
-- but you  deserve the vacation, Lois.

                         CLARK
                         (surprised)
                    Oh. You're going away.

                         LOIS
                           (kidding, with a grin)
                    Yeah, well, some of us get to go to
                    Smallville. And some of us just have
                    to settle for . . . 

She reaches into one of the shopping bags and pulls out the world's teeniest, 
tiniest bikini.

                         LOIS
                    . . . Bermuda.

CLARK'S eyes widen at the image that comes to his mind.

                         MISS HENDERSON
                           (impatient)
                    Mr. White, the next number, please?

                         PERRY
                    How'm I supposed to turn this thing?

                         MISS HENDERSON
                          (demonstrating, she tumbles  
                            the drum over by hand)
                    By hand. Like the pioneers did.

                         PERRY
                    Couldn't we just get a computer to 
                    do this?


                                                  CUT TO:






INT. COMPUTER ROOM - WEBCO - DAY

CAMERA DOLLIES THROUGH TWO GLASS DOORS (POV A ROLLING CART ENTERING THE ROOM). 
WE SEE THE WORDS STENCILED ON THE DOOR:

WEBCO INDUSTRIES - DATA PROCESSING CENTER

The room we ENTER is one of those enormous computer centers. Along the walls are 
the massive data consoles, their tape decks alternately rolling and stopping. 
Other machines extrude massive print-outs. In the center of the room are desks, 
one after another, with small table-top computer consoles, the sort that are 
operated from a keyboard. VARIOUS WORKERS are seen doing their jobs, including 
the ones operating the keyboard computers. They move rapidly around in a curious 
and unique fashion: each WORKER sits on a chair that has ball bearing wheels and 
they propel themselves from terminal to terminal by skittering around without 
leaving their chairs. To facilitate this action, they all wear white tennis 
shoes, which grips the floor for maximum purchase. The impression we get is one 
of robot-like humans zipping around from machine to machine.

WIDE SHOT, REVERSE --  Revealing that the rolling cart which took us into the 
room is pushed by an EMPLOYEE who stops at each desk and hands each person an 
envelope . . . it's payday and they're getting their paychecks. As we DOLLY BACK 
we SEE in F.G. two desks, side by side, with a keyboard console with video 
display on each.  One of them is manned by our friend with the matchbook: GUS 
GORMAN. Across the aisle is his fellow-worker, FRED.

The MAN handing out the checks stops at GUS' desk, gives him his.

GUS takes the envelope, opens it, as FRED gets the same and the cart continues 
on.

CLOSE ON GUS -- He looks in astonished dismay at his check.

                         GUS
                    Sonofagun! Look at this here!

                         FRED
                    First paycheck?

                         GUS
                    First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225
                    bucks a week! You know what this sucker 
says?? $143.80!
       (reading it, angry)
Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!

     FRED
That's so you're still getting some money
when you hit 65.

     GUS
        (gets up, starts to walk)
I ain't gonna live that long on $143.80!
I want it now, man, while I'm still young
and cool.


INT. EMPLOYEES' CAFETERIA - DAY

GUS and FRED enter the cafeteria, continuing their conversation. TRACK WITH 
THEM, as they walk down to the coffee machine. GUS mutters and works hi yo-yo 
with no success.

                         FRED
                    Actually, it's probably more like $143.80
                    and one-half cent.
                          (GUS gives him a 
                            puzzled look)
                    There's always fractions over in a big
                    corporation, but they round it down to
                    the lowest whole number.

                         GUS
                    What'm I gonna do with half a cent?
                    Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?
                          (pause; he starts to 
                                    think about it)
                    Everybody loses them fractions?

                         FRED
                    They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose 
                    what you never got.

                         GUS
                    Who gets it, the company?

                         FRED
                    No, not really. They can't be bothered
                    collecting half a cent from your paycheck 
                    anymore than you could.

                         GUS
                    So where is all them half-centses?

                         FRED
                    They're just . . . floating around out
                    there. The computer knows where.

C.U. GUS -- lost in thought

NEW ANGLE -- By now they've reached the coffee urn. FRED pulls the lever and 
fills two cups, reaches for the bowl of sugar cubes.

                         FRED
                    How many sugars?

                         GUS
                    One.
                         (pause. As FRED drops
                            one in the cup)
                    And a half.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:
INT. WEBCO COMPUTER ROOM - TWILIGHT

WIDE SHOT -- The end of the day. Employees putting on their coats, changing from 
the white sneakers into normal street shoes, leaving, saying good-night, etc.

ON GUS -- Seated at his keyboard, a faintly manic gleam in his eyes. HE stares 
at the video display screen, his fingers brushing the keys.

NEW ANGLE -- FRED puts on his jacket, gets ready to leave.

                         FRED
                    Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?

                         GUS
                    Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to
                    finish up here.

                         FRED
                         (archly)
                    Workin' overtime? What are you
                    doin', buddy, looking for a raise?

                         GUS
                          (almost to himself)
                    Yeah. A raise . . 

FRED shakes his head, turns, and leaves.

LONG SHOT -- the data processing center is empty of PEOPLE now. Just the 
computers and GUS.

MED. CLOS ON GUS -- he takes his paycheck out of the envelope again and looks 
closely at it.

INSERT -- ON THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER OF THE CHECK is a short sequence of numbers 
and letters.

                         GUS
                         (repeating them aloud)
                    368zzx4.

TIGHT ANGLE -- he punches those numbers and letters on his keyboard.

ON THE VIDEO DISPLAY -- the numbers and letters appear on the screen. Then, a 
moment later:

HELLO.
WEBCO PAYROLL DIVISION.
GIVE COMMAND COORDINATES.

ON GUS -- a broad grin.




                         GUS
                       (a man who sees the future
                         opening before him)
                    Yeah !

He begins to punch coordinates into the keyboard.

In a QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS, WE SEE VARIOUS COMPUTERS OF DIFFERENT TYPES, IN 
DIFFERENT LOCATION as they begin to flash, and/or light up and/or turn their 
memory bank tapes and/or beep and/or do other 'computer stuff'. The effect is to 
clearly indicate that what GUS is doing is having a result, that his computer is 
activating other.

EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

MED. LONG SHOT -- A Greyhound bus is travelling down a two-lane highway, which 
runs alongside a woodsy, rural area.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

A lot of the PASSENGERS are sleeping. A few read by the little individual 
overhead lights. Perhaps a couple cuddling in the back seat. Seated side by side 
toward the rear of the bus are CLARK and JIMMY. CLARK is half-dozing and trying 
to seem interested in what is obviously an interminable story that JIMMY is 
telling him.

                         JIMMY
                    But my Uncle Al, on my father's side,
                    he won't eat her stuffing, he says it
                    should be cooked on the outside of the
                    turkey and she puts the stuffing inside
                    the turkey. So my mother told my
                    Aunt Ellen . . . Aunt Ellen's my father's
                    half-sister, I told you that, right?

                         CLARK
                    Mmmmm . . . 

                         JIMMY
                    The thing is though, my cousin Arnold,
                    Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad
                    when Uncle Al insulted his mother's 
                    stuffing, so now the problem is --

                         CLARK
                         (suddenly alert,
                          looking forward)
                    What's that?

POV: LOOKING FORWARD DOWN THE AILSE -- The bus has stopped. Out the windshield 
we SEE a red glow on the horizon that lights up the sky.





TWO SHOT -- CLARK AND JIMMY

                         JIMMY
                    Wow, what a beautiful sunrise!

                         CLARK
                    At one o'clock in the morning?

CLOSER ON THE WINDSHIELD -- We now SEE police cars with dome lights blocking the 
road, barrier set up.

EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A few minutes later. The BUS DRIVER has gotten out to talk to the POLICEMAN 
blocking the road. CLARK, JIMMY, and some OTHER PASSENGERS have come out of the 
bus also to find out what's happening.

Throughout the following, CUT TO VARIOUS ANGLES showing other traffic being 
halted
and one lane cleared for emergency vehicles to pass through: ambulances, fire 
trucks, National Guard truck, etc.

                         STATE POLICEMAN
                    It's your choice. Turn back or pull over
                    to the side of the road till it's over.

                         BUS DRIVER
                    How long'll that take?

                         STATE POLICEMAN
                    You never know with forest fires. And
                    this one is spreading like . . .
                            (he has no choice but
                            to finish the sentence                         
                             he started)
                    . . . wildfire. We got 10,000 acres of
                    timber going up like matchsticks and
                    a south wind.

                         CLARK
                    What's the south wind got to do with it?

                         STATE POLICEMAN
                    Iroquois Trail Power Plant is just eight
                    miles south of the fire.

                         JIMMY
                    The nuclear power station?

JIMMY turns and runs back onto the bus.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

JIMMY grabs his camera from the overhead rack, dashes out again.


EXT. BUS - NIGHT

                         CLARK
                    How did it start?

                         STATE POLICEMAN
                    Nine times out of ten it's some careless
                    camper.

                         CLARK
                    Are there campers trapped in there?

                         STATE POLICEMAN
                    We're doing our best to get 'em out.

JIMMY comes out of the bus, pulls CLARK aside.

                         JIMMY
                    Keep talking to that state trooper so he
                    doesn't notice where I'm going, okay?

                         CLARK          
                    What are you doing?

                         JIMMY
                    You know what Mr. White said. A 
                    photographer always goes after a story.

He starts to sneak off into the nearby forest.

                         CLARK
                    Jimmy, it's dangerous!

On JIMMY -- The swashbuckling bravado of a 19 year-old:

                         JIMMY
                    Danger? That goes with the territory, 
                    Mr. Kent.

And he ducks into the woods.

C.U. CLARK -- making a decision.

NEW ANGLE -- As more cars have been stooped, a DRIVER, in F.G. gets out of his 
car to walk forward toward the barrier to see what's going on. CLARK looks 
around to make sure nobody is noticing him. Then, quickly, he opens the right-
hand side back door of the empty car and enters. A split-second later he emerges 
from the left-hand side as . . . SUPERMAN! He takes off.

                                                  CUT TO:

EXT. FOREST FIRE - NIGHT

OVERHEAD SHOTS (STOCK FOOTAGE): A terrific forest fire is raging. Miles and 
miles of burning trees, rushing winds.
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

VARIOUS SHOTS (STOCK FOOTAGE) INSIDE THE FIRES ITSELF ON GROUND LEVEL.

1. Flaming trees, timber crashing.

2. Animals running in panic.

3. Sheets of flame sweeping through woods.

Followed by VARIOUS QUICK SHOTS of brave and hard-working FIREFIGHTERS right in 
the thick of it, doing what they can:

1. Spading up the ground with shovels and hoes,
trying to create firebreaks.

2. Chain-saws at work bringing down trees to
to clear area.

3. A portable pump with hose attached drawing
water from a small pond or creek in the area.

Throughout all this, we have the impression of a blazing inferno of terrific 
proportions with sheets of flame and sounds of fire and falling trees and 
whipping winds.

EXT. STAGING AREA, FOREST FIRE - NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT -- The command post of the firefighting operation. Ambulances 
with MEDICS ready; fire trucks; hot soup and coffee wagons; EXHAUSTED 
FIREFIGHTERS getting a break, taking oxygen, drinking coffee, etc; FRESH TROOPS 
putting on their gear.

CLOSER-- THE FIRE CHIEF, clad in woodsy rainment, but with a badge denoting his 
status, stands conferring with his AIDE. He looks haggard, hot, worried. He 
holds a walkie-talkie. Suddenly, SUPERMAN lands in the area.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Chief, how can I help?

                         FIRE CHIEF
                          (calling to assistant)
                    Get this man a helmet and a ---
                          (suddenly realizes 
                                who it is)
                    Oh! It's you!
                          (calling to assistant)
                    No helmet!

                         SUPERMAN
                    What's the story?

                    


     FIRE CHIEF
                    This is a fierce one, Superman. We've 
got a hundred and twenty men on the 
northeast border building firebreaks. I've 
got volunteers coming in from as far  away
as Ohio. They're doing all they can, but --

CAMERA PANS TO SEE EXHAUSTED FIREFIGHTERS, faces covered with soot, sitting on 
the ground and breathing deeply from oxygen masks, trying to get themselves 
together, as speech continues:
     
                         FIRE CHIEF (o.s.)
they're only human.

PAN CONINUES TO A NEARBY AREA WHERE WE SEE, coming toward the soup kitchen, a 
bedraggled and besmirched BOY SCOUT TROOP 9about EIGHT BOYS AND A SCOUT MASTER) 
who were obviously evacuated from the forest. They are all turning and giving 
dirty looks to someone who walks a few paces behind them: a LONE BOY SCOUT, 
looking very forlorn and guilty, holding two fire making sticks and a bow. This 
is obviously the twerp who started the forest fire in the first place.

EXT. CABIN IN THE WOODS - NIGHT

In the middle of the forest, a log cabin sits in a clearing. Beside it is one of 
those butane gas tanks. The fire envelops it.

NEW ANGLE -- The butane tank explodes. The cabin explodes. Flames devour it in 
seconds.

EXT. FOREST FIRE - NIGHT

Leaping out from the tops of the trees, whizzing on the high winds, sparks and 
fire balls sail through the air.

ON AN UNSCHORCHED PART OF THE FOREST -- Fire balls land in a clear area. In 
VARIOUS ANGLES, WE SEE new fires start up.

NEW ANGLE -- as FIREFIGHTERS race into this area and begin flailing away at the 
fresh brushfires with shovels and picks, trying to extinguish these new fires 
before they really get going.

EXT. WATCH-TOWER, FOREST - NIGHT

LONG SHOT -- A wooden tower used for fire-spotting in the middle of the forest. 
From this distance, we can barely make out that somebody is up there in the 
tower, standing on the ledge.

CLOSER ON THE TOWER -- It's JIMMY OLSEN, who has secured himself a marvelous 
vantage point for taking photos of the fire.

WIDE ANGLE ON THE TOWER--what he doesn't realize is that the flames are creeping 
up behind the tower and will soon envelop it.



EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - NIGHT

VARIOUS SHOTS OF FIREFIGHTERS building firebreaks. It is a slow and laborious 
process. Some MEN chop down trees to clear the break line. Others turn the fresh 
earth with spades. Others haul the fallen timber out of the way. They work 
feverishly, but it's hard work and slow going.

NEW ANGLE  -- SUPERMAN lands in their midst. They're so exhausted they can 
barely muster up the customary surprise.

                         SUPERMAN
                       (all business)
                    Stand back, guys. Where do you 
want this firebreak?

     CREW LEADER
     (pointing)
From there to there.

FAVORING SUPERMAN as he quickly selects a stout, tall tree. As the MEN watch in 
astonishment, SUPERMAN grabs the base of the tree and with --

EFFECTS: SUPER-STRENGTH (and a bit of super-strain) he pulls the tree out of the 
ground, roots and all.

Quickly he hauls it to a clear area and ties a length of cable around it, 
creating an instant harness for himself.

NEW ANGLE -- He throws the cable over his shoulders, hooks his arm in it, and 
begins to race at:

EFFECTS: SUPER-SPEED straight through the heavily wooded area. The tree, pulled 
behind him like a horizontal plow, knocks down all the trees in its path. They 
fall to either side like so many pick-up sticks.

LONG SHOT -- The FIREFIGHTERS stand at the point of his departure and see the 
instant firebreak being created before their eyes.

LONG WIDE ANGLE DOWN (ARIAL SHOT) -- We SEE the firebreak forming, the tall 
trees crashing down to the ground on either side of the blue speedball that is 
SUPERMAN.

ON THE FORMAN OF THE FIREBREAK CREW, who speaks into his walkie-talkie to the 
central command post:

                         FORMAN
                    Chief, this is the North Boundary Crew.
                    We've got a firebreak that should contain 
it on our end.







EXT. COMMAND POST, FOREST - NIGHT

                         CHIEF
                        (to walkie-talkie)
                    It's not going to be that easy on the
                    south side. The winds are blowing 
fireballs right over the breaks.

EXT. IROQUOIS TRAIL NUCLEAR POWER STATION (TOWERS) - NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT -- An icon of our times: the three concrete silos we associate 
with nuclear energy stations, c.f. Three Mile Island. In the distance, we SEE 
the glow of the fire.

ON THE GATE surrounding the tower closest to the forest. A number of SCIENTISTS, 
SECURITY MEN, etc. are standing there watching the approaching fire through 
binoculars. Behind them, we SEE the largest of the towers looming.

A very worried PLANT SUPERVISOR puts downs his binoculars and turns to the 
SECURITY CHIEF standing beside him.

                         PLANT SUPERVISOR
                    Man, if that fire gets much closer, we're
                    going to have ourselves some big trouble.

                         SECURITY CHIEF
                    The nuclear reactor?

                         PLANT SUPERVISOR
                         (grimly)
                    You figure it out. That --
                         (points at tower)
is a cooling tower, right? The 
nuclear core inside it is stabilized
by the temperature. If the fire gets
here, it'll stop being a cooling
tower, and turn into a furnace.

C.U. SECURITY CHIEF

                         SECURITY CHIEF
                    Oh, my God! You mean a melt-down!

                         PLANT SUPERVISOR
                    Get the civil defense people on the phone.
                    We may have to evacuate the whole damn
                    state!

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST, A-FRAME COTTAGE - NIGHT

An A-frame summer cottage has been constructed in a clearing in the woods. ANGLE 
FAVORS the big glass façade of it, one enormous picture window with wood trim. 
The window reflects the fire coming closer to the house.

CLOSER ON THE GLASS as is begins to heat up and distort the image of the 
encroaching flames. Suddenly, the window buckles and blows out with a terrific 
crash.
EXT. FOREST ROAD - NIGHT

MED. LONG SHOT -- HEADING TOWARD CAMERA, a camper trailer (recreational vehicle) 
is speeding down a dirt road, trying to get to safety. But its back end has 
already caught on fire.

ON THE CAB -- A TERRIFIED DRIVER, HIS WIFE, AND THEIR KID in there.

NEW ANGLE -- Finally, as the flames begin to consume more of the vehicle, the 
DRIVER brakes to a halt. HE and his family run like hell away just before the 
trailer explodes in a ball of fire.

EXT. COMMAND POST, FOREST - NIGHT

The CHIEF looks incredulous at something he's just heard over his walkie-talkie.

                         CHIEF
                    What??!
                         (to walkie-talkie)
                    How did he get there?
                         (to AIDE beside him)
                    Some lunatic is up in the watch-
                    tower taking pictures.
                    
                         AIDE
                    So?

                         CHIEF
                    So that tower's right in the 
                    middle of pure hell right now!

EXT. WATCHTOWER, FOREST - NIGHT

MED. CLOSE ON THE TOP OF THE TOWER -- JIMMY is taking photos, so intent and 
excited that he doesn't realize what danger he's in.

LONG SHOT -- The flames attack the struts of the tower. They start to collapse. 
The entire tower buckles and topples forward like a man with two (suddenly) 
broken legs.

TIGHTER ANGLE -- As it falls. JIMMY is hurled out of the tower onto the ground.

ON JIMMY-- He lays there, moaning in pain, clutching his leg (which is broken). 
Surrounded by fire. Things look very bad for him.

ANGLE UP -- Suddenly, SUPERMAN appears walking through a wall of flame. He is 
unhurt by the fire. He makes his way to the fallen JIMY, lifts him up and flies 
out of the fire.

EXT. COMMAND POST, AMBULANCES - NIGHT

The area of the command post where the ambulances are waiting. DOCTORS, NURSES, 
MEDICS, etc. stand by.




SUPERMAN lands with JIMMY in his arms and gently lays him on one of the 
stretchers just by the ambulance.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Easy, Jimmy.

                         JIMMY
                        (in pain)
                    It's my leg.

SUPERMAN looks at Jimmy's leg. We see an X-ray shot of the broken bone.

                         SUPERMAN
                         (to the MEDIC)
                    It's a clean break right across the
                    fibula.

CUT TO COMMAND POST as a breathless FIREFIGHTER runs up to report to his CHIEF.

                         FIREFIGHTER
                    The water supply is practically gone!

                         CHIEF
                          (worried)
                    We've got to get water!

                         FIREFIGHTER
                    How? Lake Comooga is five miles
                    from here. We haven't got a five
                    mile hose.

C.U. SUPERMAN -- as he hears about the problem.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Where is this lake?

                         CHIEF
                         (points)
                    That way.

SUPERMAN immediately flies off in that direction.

EXT. LAKE SHORE - NIGHT

MED. WIDE SHOT -- SUPERMAN lands at the edge of a lake about 200 yards long and 
wide. He surveys the expanse of water before him. Then:

SPECIAL EFFECTS: He blows a steady gust of ice-breath across the surface of the 
lake. In moments, the entire surface freezes solid.

NEW ANGLE -- He bends down and grasps the edge of the ice cover in his hands. 
It's about five-inches thick. Slowly, he begins to pull and lift at the same 
time.

WIDE SHOT -- The entire platter of ice, the size of the lake, is lifted off the 
top. Holding it before him, SUPERMAN flies into the sky.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

An amazing sight: SUPERMAN FLYING toward the glowing red sky where the forest 
fire rages, holding the enormous ice platter before him.

He arrives over the center of the forest fire. He flings the frozen lake over 
the fire. As the ice starts to fall, the heat from below melts it and turns in 
into a tremendous torrent of water.

VARIOUS ANGLES -- The melted lake water puts out  the major part of the fire.

ON THE GROUND, REACTIONS from the FIREFIGHTERS, etc. Total joy and amazement.

EXT. IROQUOIS TRAIL NUCLEAR POWER TOWER - NIGHT

The flames have spread to the base of the tower now, licking at the sides. CREWS 
of WORKERS, SCIENTISTS et al have been hastily organized into firefighting 
units. They are hosing down the sides of the main tower, trying to cool it. 
Steam erupts as the water hits the hot concrete.

                         SECURITY GUARD
                    It's not going to work! It's too hot 
                    now!

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

SUPERMAN flies at top speed toward the Iroquois Trail towers in B.G.

INTERCUT SHOTS of SUPERMAN closer to the familiar silos and FIREFIGHTERS on the 
ground, trying to hose down the silo and put out the encroaching flames all 
around it.

LONG SHOT -- SUPERMAN flies directly into the largest concrete silo.

INT. INNER CHAMBER, NUCLEAR REACTOR - NIGHT                    

Sound: a strident alarm going continuously, a sound of panic.

ON A GAUGE -- A needle has zipped into the Red for Danger area and is wobbling 
wildly at the end of the scale.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL a harried SCIENTIST in white coat.

                         SCIENTIST
                    It's going right off the end of
                    the scale, Dr. Harris!

FULL SHOT -- The outer chamber of the reactor. SCIENTISTS at their stations, 
manning dials. Behind three thick glass shields we SEE into the inner chamber 
where no man can go. Mechanical robot-arms are controlled from the outer 
chamber.



                         DR. HARRIS
                    Start the emergency cooling
                    procedure.

CLOSER ON THE WINDOW showing the inner chamber -- all stainless steel and white 
tile. In the center, on a kind of platform, the nuclear core glows red hot, 
emanating pulsations of radiation. A fearful thing. It appears to be two 
cylinders, each about a foot long, and as it approaches destabilization, the two 
cylinders (one above the other) are moving closer and closer to each other. It 
is clear that if they join it will be irrevocable. Melt-down will occur.

                         SCIENTIST
                    It isn't helping! We're about two
                    minutes from melt-down!

Suddenly, SUPERMAN lands inside the chamber.

                         DR. HARRIS
                    Superman!
                         (talking though intercom)
                    Be careful! There's enough radiation
                    in that core to light up the whole 
                    country for a year!
                    
                         SUPERMAN
                    Don't worry. I'll just stabilize it.

CLOSER -- SUPERMAN grasps the red-hot cylinders. A fleeting expression on his 
face lets us know the even he finds this pretty hot stuff. Slowly, with great 
caution and great power, he pulls the two cylinders apart further and further, 
back into their housing.

ON THE GAGE -- The needle drops back to NORMAL.

Sound: the alarm that has been ringing suddenly quits.

REACTIONS -- Incredible relief from the SCIENTISTS. Mopping their brows, etc.

SUPERMAN smile to the scientists and flies up and out of the silo.

                         DR. HARRIS
                        (in wonderment)
                    It isn't very scientific, gentlemen,
                    but I tell you that man is a miracle.

EXT. SMALLVILLE HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

C.U. (PROFILE) of a very little OLD LADY: ancient, now-retired teacher MINNIE 
BANISTER, peering at the shirt and tie on a chest, which is exactly at her eye 
level. As she cranes her neck upwards to address the head on top of this body 
and says:

                         MINNIE BANNISTER
                    You really have grown, Clark.



WE PAN UP WITH HER GAZE to REVEAL CLARK KENT smiling gently down at her.

                         CLARK
                    You're looking well, Miss
                    Bannister.

WIDER -- The gym is decorated: crepe paper, balloons, posters, colored lights, 
and blow-ups of the old black and white graduation photos of the alumni, 
including one of the series, studios, bespectacled young CLARK KENT, mixed with 
standard yearbook shots of the great moments of the class of '65 (big games, 
Senior Prom, production of 'Our Town,' etc.).

Surrounded by COUPLES dancing tot he strains of Golden Oldies from their high 
school era, CLARK continues to make polite chat with MINNIE BANNISTER until, 
suddenly, he focuses on something across the room. 

CLARK'S POV: Across the room, a YOUNG WOMAN about his age has just entered the 
gym, carrying a stack of records in one arm and a stack of paper plates in the 
other. Red-haired and very pretty in an all-American way, LANA LANG seems like 
the kind of girl who would instantly be surrounded by friends and admirers. 
Oddly, she's not. In fact, she is the only woman here without a mate or even a 
date. As if to platy down her aloneness, she instantly gets busy, quickly 
checking the refreshments and adjusting a loose decoration. But then, as she 
picks up her plates and records again and turns to CAMERA she sees, through the 
spaces between dancing COUPLES, something that makes her stop. And smile.

C.U. LANA -- Her eyes sparkling with delight as she mimes the word to him:

                         LANA
                    Clark?

C.U. CLARK -- A warm smile for her as he too mouths her name:

                         CLARK
                    LANA?

As we are SEEING all this interplay, we are at the same time hearing:

                          MINNIE BANNISTER (o.s.)
                    I can't complain. Oh, I take the 
                    stairs a bit slower these days, and
                    of course I get theses spells, but
                    I can't complain...

                         CLARK
               Will you excuse me, Miss Bannister?
                    There's someone I really have to say
                    hello to.

NEW ANGLE -- FULL SHOT as they make their way to each other.







CLOSER -- There's a lot of unspoken past history between CLARK and LANA. Indeed, 
he had a serious crush on her during all his young years and she knew it even if 
she didn't acknowledge it then. Now, fifteen years later, they are very glad to 
see each other      again.      
          
                         CLARK
                    Lana Lang. How great to see you.

                         LANA
                    Clark.

She suddenly leans forward and kisses him on the cheek.

(A NOTE ON LANA LANG: Lana is one of these people, who, both by nature and by 
exigencies of her situation, seems to be carrying on three conversations at once 
and often doing two or three different tasks at once. Although such people seem 
perfectly clear in their own minds about the direction their thoughts are going 
in, it's often confusing and disconcerting to others. As Lana is often keeping 
three conversation balls in the air simultaneously, Clark is hardput to keep up 
with her, getting lost in the conversation, thinking she means one thing, when 
in fact she's gone on to another subject. The effect is comical for us, a bit 
unsettling for him, and should finally be genuinely charming and adorable in his 
eyes. In the dialogue as written, Lana's separate thoughts are indicated by 
breaks and indications, but in performance they should run right into each other 
non-stop).

                         LANA
                    You look wonderful.
     
                         CLARK
                    You always did.
                        (indicating plates
                          and dishes)
                    Can I give you a hand with that?

They start walking toward the buffet table. TRACK WITH THEM.

                         LANA
                    No, I can mange, This is the first
                    time you've been back since your
                    mom passed away, isn't it?
                         (as he nods)
                    I can't believe it. 
TRACK WITH THEM.

                         LANA
                    No, I can mange, This is the first
                    time you've been back since your
                    mom passed away, isn't it?
                         (as he nods)
                    I can't believe it. You came all the 
                    way from Metropolis just for this
                    dinky little reunion?





They stop.

                         CLARK
                    You shouldn't say that, you're the
                    chairman --
                        (uncertainly)
                    ...uh, chairperson...

                         LANA
                         (struck by the thought)
                    And here I am, just standing 
                    here. That's terrible. Thank you.

                         CLARK
                          (confused)
                    You're welcome...??

                         LANA
                    For reminding me, I mean. Can
                    you follow me?

She changes direction, starts to walk toward the music area where a D.J. has a 
record player set up.

                         CLARK
                    I'm trying to.

He follows her. As they reach the TEENAGE D.J.:

                         LANA
                    I just have to give these to
                    the --

Smiling at CLARK, she doesn't realize she setting the paper plates, not records, 
down by the D.J.'s set-up. The D.J. is about to protest, but LANA has already 
turned away and walks briskly to the nearby buffet table again.

                         CLARK
                    I heard you and Donald split
                    up.

LANA seems not to hear him as she sets the stack of records down on the buffet 
table.

                         LANA
                    Did you eat yet?

She grabs a record off the top of the stack, scoops up a ladleful of potato 
salad, sees suddenly that she's just about to dump it on a record.







                         LANA
                        (shaking her head)
                    That's not right.
                         (to Clark)
                    Yes, you're right about me 
                    and Donald but -- hold it a
                    sec, okay?

She hands the full scoop of potato salad to CLARK, picks up the stack of records 
and takes them over to the D.J. HOLD ON CLARK, holding a scoop of potato salad, 
feeling foolish. At this precise moment, TWO of the more successful-looking 
ALUMNI drift by with their WIVES.

                         FIRST MAN
                    Hey, Kent.

                         SECOND MAN
                    How ya' doin'?

CLARK is about to shake hands. At the last moment he has to transfer the scoop 
of potato salad awkwardly to his left hand. The COUPLES drift off, smiling, 
CLARK watching them as the FIRST MAN murmurs to the SECOND MAN:

                         FIRST MAN
                    Some guys never change...

VERTICAL PAN UP TO a blown-up black and white high school photo of serious, 
somewhat awkward-looking teenage CLARK KENT. CAMERA PANS ACROSS WALL OF 
DECORATIONS, COMING TO A STOP ON A BIG PHOTO BLOW-UP of a handsome young blonde 
football player. It is captioned Brad Wilson -- All State 1964.  In the picture 
he holds the ball, arm cocked back to pass for a touchdown. He looks like a 
young, blonde Greek god. As we SEE this, we hear, off screen:

                         BRAD (o.s.)
                        (noticeably drunken
                          voice)
                    The game against Mid-City,
                    that's the one I'll never forget.
                    Fourth quarter, score was tied, 
                    and we're backed up on our
                    own 25-yard line. The Coach
                    sends in a play -- Right Flanker
                    Option. But I knew I could throw
                    a long one. See, I knew that their
                    cornerback was hurtin' and...

In the middle of the above, PAN DOWN FROM PHOTO to reveal the MAN who is 
bragging about his past exploits. Quite a shocking change from the photo. Hair 
thinning, surly, and possessing the bloated looks of a thirtyish ex-athlete 
going to pot, this is BRAD WILSON. He's talking to TWO CLASSMATES. Suddenly, he 
stops and his face lights up as LANA passes nearby. FOLLOW HIM as he hurries, 
just a little unsteadily, to her side. As:

Music: D.J. puts on a record of  "Earth Angel." We hear the tune but not the 
lyric.

                         BRAD
                    Here I am, honey, and I'm all
                    yours.
                         (with boozy, over-
                          bearing "gallantry")
                    Remember when you were Queen of
                    the Prom? All the guys had to wait in
                    line to get a dance.
                          (they have reached the
                           buffet table where 
       Clark waits)
But now there's only one name on
your dance card, sweet thing, and
it's --

     CLARK
                           (recognizing him)
                    Brad Wilson.

                         BRAD
                    Hiya, Kent, long time no see.
                    Not that you ever could.
                          (points to CLARK'S
                            glasses)
                    "See" I mean,
                          (he cracks up at
                            his dumb joke)
                    Hahaha!

BRAD grabs LANA'S arm. She pulls away, simultaneously slipping her other arm 
through CLARK'S.

                         LANA
                    I can't
                         (quickly)
                    Clark already asked me.
                         (to CLARK)
                    Didn't you?
                         (to BRAD, improvising)
                    He used to love this song.
                         (to CLARK)
                    Didn't you?
                         (to BRAD)
                    So he just said --
                         (to CLARK, a bit
                            desperately)
                    "Would you dance with me?"

                         CLARK
                    Sure, Lana, I'd love to.

As they glide away onto he dance floor, LANA close to CLARK, BRAD scowls, 
jealous and pissed-off.

WATCH THEM dance for a few moments. There's chemistry there, just beginning to 
assert itself. 

INT. CHECK MACHINE

UNDER A SIGN THAT SAYS "WEBCO, PAYROLL DEPT." a big check printing machine, 
activated by computer, is spewing forth its payload" check after check comes out 
of a slot and the stack grows higher.

INT. DATA PROCESSING COMPUTER ROOM

As before, the MAN with the cart is handing out the paychecks.

                         MAN
                    Gorman. Another week, another
                    check.
                          (gives him his
                            envelope)
                    
                         GUS
                    You got another one there for me?

                         MAN
                          (laughing)
                    What??

                         GUS
                    I put in a voucher for expenses.
                    Thought it might have come
                    through.

The MAN looks and is surprised to find, indeed, another envelope with GUS'S 
name.

                         MAN
                    Oh yeah. Here you go.

CLOSE ON GUS -- He holds the envelope in his hand, trying not to show his 
excitement. But you can practically hear his heart pounding. Now, almost afraid 
to look, he slowly edges the check out of its envelope. He closes both eyes. Now 
he opens one eye and peeks.

INSERT -- On the "Expenses" check emerging from the envelope.

First we SEE the name: AUGUST GORMAN. And then...the amount: $85,789.80!

                         GUS (o.s.)
                         (quietly)
                    Pennies from heaven.








INT. SMALLVILLE HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

TIGHT C.U. LANA -- Looking RIGHT

                         LANA
                         (voice echoing slightly)
                    Thanks for helping me out.

TIGHT C.U. CLARK -- Looking LEFT

                         CLARK
                         (voice echoing slightly)
                    Are you kidding? There must be
                    a lot of guys who'd like to be in
                    my place.

EXTREME LONG SHOT -- CLARK and LANA are no longer dancing. The party's over and 
they are standing on top of the two tall ladders at opposite ends of the now 
deserted gym. A space at least as large as a basketball court is between them, 
explaining the hollow rings in their voices. They talk in conversational tones, 
but louder than normally. They are engaged in taking down the decorations after 
the reunion; the party's over. Crepe paper, banners. photos, etc. are coming 
down and being stacked or discarded. The full bright gym lights are on now; no 
ambiance any more. Between them is the platform that served as the bandstand 
earlier; the electric piano and some of the loudspeakers are still there. The 
feeling is one of 'after the ball.'

(Note: throughout the following, LANA uses her various tools...claw hammer, 
staple extractor, etc....with marked skill and dexterity).

                         LANA
                        (wryly)
                    You'd be surprised how many offers
                    I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't
                    stick around for this.
                        (as she tries to 
     untack  a long crepe 
     paper streamer)      
It really isn't easy.

     CLARK
     (thinking she means 
      the task at hand)
The streamers? They're no
problem, you just pull on 
them and --

He does so on a streamer near his ladder. It cascades to the floor in a great 
colorful heap.

FAVORING LANA

                         LANA
                    Not the streamers. Everything.
                    Not that I'm complaining. It's 
just that -- I don't know why
but I feel like I can talk to you.
     CLARK
     (some distance away)
What?

     LANA
      (louder)
I feel like I can talk to you!

FAVORING CLARK -- who looks pleased

                         CLARK
                    Well, I always wished you 
                    would. Back when you were --
                         (he hesitates)

ON LANA -- as she reaches up and takes down a big, captioned photo of a teenaged 
LANA and a YOUNG MAN (DONALD) dressed as King and Queen of the Senior Prom. 
DONALD is grinning proudly at the camera while LANA gazes adoringly at him.

                         LANA
                         (finishing CLARK'S
                          sentence)
                    Queen of the Prom?

With that she drops the picture from the top of the ladder. It falls with a thud 
to the gym floor.

                         LANA
                    And three years after the 
                    Royal Wedding, the King
                    abdicated.
                   (climbing down the 
                         ladder now, suddenly
                         looking away from CLARK)     
Isn't that terrible?

     CLARK
     (compassionately, as he
      too, climbs down his
      ladder)
It sure is.

     LANA
                            (but she meant something
                           else, as she points to 
                           buffet table:)
                    There must be a gallon of potato
                    salad left over.

She walks over to the bowl, peers into it, finally turns back to CLARK who has 
joined her there.

                         LANA
                    You know what's the problem?

                         CLARK
                        (tentatively)
                    Too much mayonnaise?

                         LANA
                    Mayonnaise? Donald loved
                    mayonnaise. Why would you 
think that was the problem.?

     CLARK
     (very confused)
I didn't --

     LANA
No, the problem is --
     (heatedly)
Why do I stay in Smallville?
Believe me, I've asked myself
the same question. Do you know 
how lucky you are to live in
Metropolis?
    (eyes shining)
The Big Apricot.

     CLARK
But Lana, you could --

ON LANA

                         LANA
                        (wistfully)
                    That's easy to say. But how?
                    And what about Ricky?

                         CLARK
                         (completely at sea)
                    Who?

                         LANA
                    Ricky. My little boy. At least
                    here we've got a house. and I've
                    got a job. Okay, I'm only a 
                    secretary, oaky, but it pays the
                    bills. Except for last winter
                    when the fuel bills kept going
                    up and up and up.
                        (extendes her hand, eyes
                          her bare ring finger)
                    I even had to pawn my diamond 
ring then.





ON CLARK -- Distressed for her.

                         CLARK
                    Gee...

LANA (o.s.)
                         (resignedly)
                    I guess there's nothing I can 
                    do about that.

TWO SHOT -- But CLARK realizes that now she's talking about something else, as 
she points upward.

ANGLE UP -- There at the top of the gym roof, a cluster of balloons stick to the 
ceiling.

                         LANA
                        (a little shrug)
                    Well, we can't fly up there and
                    get them.

QUICK C. U. CLARK -- A fleeting, private smile.

NEW ANGLE -- As CLARK starts to gather up the fallen streamers from the floor. 
LANA glances over at him.

                         LANA
                         (tentatively)
                    You...um...you never got married?

                         CLARK
                    Oh...I came close once.

As LANA starts to stack stuff in the corner of the gym, CLARK idly turns to the 
piano, strikes a chord. Then:

                         CLARK
                         (singing quietly,      
                          his favorite oldie)
                    "Earth Angel, Earth Angel,
                    Please be mine...

ON LANA -- She stops and turns, looks at him fondly, smiling.

                         LANA
                    That song. I remember one day
                    I came into the music room and
                    you were fooling around at the 
                    piano. And I thought -- what am
                    I going to do with all this potato
                    salad?

                         CLARK
                          (confused)
                    You thought that?

                         LANA
                       (going back to 
                        square one)
                    I thought "Clark Kent has a 
                    really nice voice." You didn't
                    even know I was there.

ON CLARK -- He stops singing, almost blushing.

ON LANA -- She hasn't noticed. She is standing looking at a photo that has not 
yet been taken down from the wall -- that smiling and serious young face of 
CLARK KENT.

                         LANA
                        (quietly)
                    You know, years later you can
                    look at someone and think, well,
                    I guess that's the one, that's the
                    one that got away.

C.U. CLARK -- That really got to him.

INT. ROSS WEBSTER'S OFFICE - DAY

ON ROSS WEBSTER in a spectacularly lush office, filled with amazing gadgets and 
décor. This is our first meeting with the man himself and we quickly see his 
style is that calculatedly gruff "democratic" jolly camaraderie reminiscent of 
Nelson Rockefeller. in other words, this is a guy who insists on having his 
servants call him by his first name, but that doesn't mean he would ever invite 
one to sit at his table. At this moment in time, the Humanitarian of the Year is 
clearly upset about something.

                         ROSS
                    Give it to me again, fella. Just
                    run it by me one more time.

REVERSE, WIDE ANGLE -- Standing on the other side of the massive desk is an 
elderly man in a dark business suit who looks extremely ill-at-ease. This is the 
Chief Accountant of Webco. MR. SIMPSON.

                         SIMPSON
                        (extremely nervous)
                    85,000 dollars.

                         ROSS
                    Missing????

                         SIMPSON
                    Embezzled, Mr. Webster.
                        (he can barely say it)
                    Stolen from the firm.






From off-screen, a strident voice that could curdle milk rings out; it is the 
voice of VERA WEBSTER, the sister.

                         VERA (o.s.)
                    By whom?

BOTH MEN turn sharply in the direction of the voice. PAN TO a door that connects 
to an anteroom. Dressed in a suit that somehow reminds us of Joseph Stalin, 
VERA, in a foul mood, enters.

                         VERA
                    That's what I want to know!
                    By whom? Whom????

                         ROSS
                    Get a hold of yourself, Vera.
                         (under his breath)
                    Nobody else ever will.

                         SIMPSON
                    I don't know who. Whom. I can't
                    trace it.
                         (years of bitterness
                          coming out)
                    In the old days it was simple. We 
                    kept books, we had ledgers, we
                    could see what was going in and
                    what was paid out. If somebody
                    wanted to rob you, he'd come in
                    with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."
                          (frustrated)
                    Now they get theses blasted
                    computers to do their dirty work!

                         ROSS
                    My friend, you are yesterday.
                    Whoever pulled this caper is 
                    tomorrow.

Suddenly, the door flies open and LORELEI bursts in, all a-twitter.

                         LORELEI
                    Ross, honey, it's time for your
                    massage...

                         VERA
                         (furious)
                    Bubba, does this woman have
                    the right to burst in without
                    knocking...!





VERA is seething with animosity: LORELEI looks at her with undisguised loathing.

                         ROSS
                        (ill-at-ease)
                    Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you 
                    know my Staff Dietician?

                         SIMPSON
                    Hello.

                         VERA
                        (to LORELEI)
                    If you don't mind, we are trying
                    to hold a meeting here!

                         LORELEI
                    Why don't you hold your breath,
                    instead? Maybe you'll turn blue.
                    On you that'd be an improvement.

Steely-eyed, VERA advances on her with controlled fury.

                         VERA
                    Pay attention, people: I am
                    about to take a human life.

ROSS quickly intervenes, upset at this turn of events. he keeps the TOW WOMAN 
apart and:

                         ROSS
                        (big, fake smile
                          to SIMPSON)
                    Old pal, would you just step
                    outside for a sec?
     
SIMPSON departs; the TWO WOMEN explode in anger, simultaneously:

          VERA                         LORELEI
        Bubba, I will not let                   Ross, tell her to stop
        this woman insult me...                   picking on me or I'll...

                         ROSS
                        (commandingly, in 
                         stentorian tones)
                    Mouths ...closed! Ears...open!
                         (cowed, scared, the 
                          WOMEN shut up)
                    Now the last thing any of us 
                    wants is for me to be upset. Right? 
Right! and it upsets me very much
when my favorite sister an my
favorite Aerobic Instructor don't
get along.
     (Continued)

     ROSS (cont.)
      (sternly, shaking his
       finger at them)
Now I don't want to ever see
this sort of thing again or...
well,...
      (threateningly)
I can't have anyone with me
who isn't with me.
      (reluctant murmurs of          
       assent from the WOMEN)     
Now...kiss and make up.

Surely, LORELEI pursers her lips.

                         VERA
                    I don't kiss.

                         ROSS
                         (remembering)
                    Oh, right. Well then, just shake
                    hands.

The TWO ENEMIES shake hands.

INSERT -- The hands grip and squeeze each other, knuckles turning white.

TWO SHOT -- In spite of the struggle and pain, VERA and LORELEI smile teeth-
baring smiles for ROSS'S benefit.

                         ROSS
                         (pleased to see they're
                           cooperating)
                    That's my best gals.
                          (calls out)
                    Come back in, my boy.

A split-second later the sweating, elderly SIMPSON is back in the room.

                         ROSS
                    Well, chum? What now? Kiss the
                    85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's
                    salary while he thinks up new ways
                    to shake the money tree?

                         SIMPSON
                          (helpfully)
                    He's bound to slip up sooner
                    or later.

                         VERA
                    Why?



                         SIMPSON
                    Uh...I don't know...that's what 
                    they always say in the movies.

ROSS paces, building up steam. A slow burn heating up.

                         ROSS
                    Unless the man's a complete idiot,
                    he won't slip up at all. He'll just go 
on quietly taking the bread from 
our mouths. unless he's a total 
ignoramus, he'll keep a low profile
and won't do a thing to call attention 
to himself.
      (voice rising)
Unless he is an utter moron...

Suddenly:

Sound: A loud sports car motor revs up outside the window. It sounds like the 
last lap at Sebring.

FULL SHOT -- ROSS, VERA, LORELEI, and SIMPSON, startled at the sudden noise, go 
to the window to look out and see what it is.

POV: OUT THE WINDOW -- The company parking lot. Zooming down one of the lanes, 
then executing a hairpin turn, burning rubber and pulling into a parking space 
is an incredible bright red Ferrari...the flashiest of sports car you could 
imagine;. Behind the wheel still dressed in his shabby, schleppy clothes, is GUS 
GORMAN.

EXT. SMALLVILLE BOWLING ALEY - DAY

A neon sign proclaims "SMALLVILLE LANES" and a lettered sign announces "Family 
Rates."

INT. BOWLING ALLEY - DAY

FULL SHOT -- A six-lane bowling alley. BOWLERS playing. On the far side, in 
B.G., a bar.

CLOSER ON ONE LANE -- A bunch of KIDS are choosing up teams, three to a side. 
There seems to be some argument going on between the TWO TEAM CAPTAINS about ONE 
BOY who stands a bit apart, looking forlorn and uncomfortable. He' smaller than 
the others, like the runt in a litter, and there's a certain timorousness about 
him. He has his mother's red hair: this is LANA'S son, RICKY.

One of the team CAPTAINS is looking annoyed as he points at RICKY.

                         FIRST BOY
                           (to his OPPONENT)
                    That means we gotta take Ricky.

                         SECOND BOY
                    Too bad, you lost the toss.

                         FIRST BOY
                    If we gotta have Ricky on our
                    side, then we get a two strike
                    handicap.

REVERSE, WIDE: Seated around the scoreboard table are a number of parents, as 
well as LANA and CLARK.

                         LANA
                           (distressed)
                    I just can't stand this.

                         CLARK
                           (trying to be positive)
                    Hey, he'll be all right. Believe me
                    Lana, I know. I was a late bloomer
                    myself.

                         LANA
                    It isn't only that he's small for
                    his age. how would you like
                    to be the only kid in town
                    without a father?
                           (as she looks in
                            another direction)
                    Look at him, he's stewed to the
                    gills in the middle of the afternoon.

                         CLARK
                          (still looking at
                           RICKY)
                    But all he had was chocolate milk.

     LANA
I mean him.

She points, and CAMERA FOLLOWS HER GESTURE TO REVEAL BRAD, tipsy, making his way 
toward them from the bar, a bottle of beer in his hand.

                         BRAD
                    Hiya, sweet thing.
                          (indicating RICKY)
                    Little guy's getting' hassled,
                    huh?
                          (to CLARK, curtly)
                    Kent, you still here?

                         CLARK
                    I seem to be.






                         BRAD
                          (to LANA)
                    All the kid needs is a couple
                    of pointers from the ol' champ
                    here.
                         (he means himself)
                    Kent, I bet you didn't know I
                    won the all-country bowling
                    trophy two years in a row.

                         CLARK
                    Uh, no, I didn't know that, Brad.

                         BRAD
                    A natural athlete can play any
                    sport. Any sport.

And with that, he turns and heads right for RICKY.

TWO SHOT --  CLARK and LANA

                         LANA
                    Oh, no. This'll only make it
                    worse.

NEW ANGLE -- RICKY, first to bowl, lifts a ball from the rack. The ball is 
really too heavy for him to handle well, but he gamely takes his position at the 
line and, a bit clumsily, bowls a wobbly ball.     

ON THE BALL -- it pretty much runs out of steam by the time it gets to the pins, 
but manages to knock down a few.

ON RICKY -- looking disappointed.

                         FIRST BOY
                    See? What'd I tell ya?

As RICKY goes to get the ball coming back on the rack for his second go, BRAD 
lurches over to him, putting on a big helpful show for LANA'S benefit.

                         BRAD
                    Hey, sport, you're holdin' it all
                    wrong. Lemme show you --


He leans to RICKY as he talks; RICKY recoils from the gust of whiskey breath. As 
BRAD tries to wrest the ball from the embarrassed boy --

                         BRAD
                    Let ol' Uncle Brad show you
                    how it's done.




                         CLARK
                          (sternly)
                    Say, Brad. I think he'll be 
                    better off doing it his way.

                          BRAD
                          (amazed at the
                           effrontery)
                    For a guy who was lucky to be 
                    water-boy on the high school
                    team, you sure got a big mouth,
                    Kent.

CLARK moves closer to him to speak in confidence: MOVE IN TO VERY TIGHT TWO 
SHOT.

                         CLARK
                          (sotto voice)
                    I just think Ricky would rather not
                    get a bowling lesson in front of the
                    other kids.

                         BRAD
                    The kid needs a man to show him --

                         CLARK
                    The kid will do fine on his own.
                          (to RICKY)
                    Give it your best shot, Ricky!

As RICKY walks to his position behind the line:

ON CLARK -- who seemingly "accidentally" trips over the chalk container, 
knocking it over. The hunk of chalk breaks and chalk dust rises in the air where 
CLARK tries to pick it up.

                         BRAD
                          (derisively)
                    Clark Klutz. Same as ever.

ON RICKY -- holding the heavy ball, he advances to the line.

C.U. LANA -- eyes averted.

C.U. CLARK -- chalk dust on his face, his nose starts to twitch like a man about 
to sneeze.

ON RICKY -- he bowls the ball, rather weekly.

C.U. CLARK -- who points his face at the line and lets out a Super-Sneeze.

EFFECTS: The Super-Sneeze causes the ball to whiz down the alley at Super-Speed. 
It hits the pins with such impact that they break into a hundred pieces like so 
many china cups.

C.U. RICKY -- astonished. And then joyfully delighted.

C.U. BRAD -- his jaw drops.

                           LANA
                          (to CLARK)
                    Gezundheit!       

INT. WEBCO DATA PROCESSING CENTER - DAY

GUS seated at his computer, at work. His neighbor FRED comes walking down the 
aisle, looking serious.

                         FRED
                    Gus?

                         GUS
                    Say what?

                         FRED
                    The boss wants to see you.

                         GUS
                    Say who?

Feet churning rapidly, GUS propels his rolling chair toward the exit.

EXT. LOBBY, GLASS ELEVATOR - DAY

LONG SHOT -- the glass elevator begins its ascent tot he highest level of 
management, the office of  ROSS WEBSTER himself. Inside, little GUS GORMAN 
shakes and quakes in full view of everybody in the lobby and at each level.

INT. GLASS ELEVATOR - DAY

                         GUS
                         (abject terror)
                    Oh my God! The Boss! Ross
                    the Boss! The Ross!

At which point the elevator reaches another level. Seeing a MAN staring right at 
him, GUS manages a sickly smile, which vanishes the instant he rises out of the 
MAN'S sight.

INT. OUTER OFFICE OF ROSS WEBSTER - DAY

GUS steps out of the elevator, nervously working his yo-yo (an upgraded model 
now that he's come into some money; this is a plastic one) and stands, almost 
trembling before the desk of a snooty SECRETARY. A gold plaque on her desk 
reads:

ROSS WEBSTER
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD

                         SECRETARY
                    Mr. Gorman?



                         GUS
                         (talking fast, in
                          pure fear)
                    No! He died last week. I 
                    just look something like
                    him. People always make
                    this mistake.

                         SECRETARY
                    Mr. Webster is waiting to see you.

                         GUS
                    He alone? Or is there, like uh...
                    men in uniform...or, uh...plain
                    clothes.

                         SECRETARY
                    Please go in, Mr. Gorman.

                         GUS
                         (imitating his idea
                          of a white executive-
                          type)
                    Say, dear, where's the wash
                    room located? I'd like to 
                    freshen up a bit before...

ROSS'S voice barks out over the intercom on her desk:

                         ROSS (o.s.)
                          (intercom)
                    Is he here yet, Miss Collins?

                         SECRETARY
                          (pushing intercom 
                           button)
                    Yes sir, I'm sending him in.

Fingering hi yo-yo like it was a rosary, GUS enters.

INT. ROSS WEBSTER'S OFFICE - DAY

FULL SHOT -- a wall of bookcases, massively out-sized chess set and various 
gadgets. Seated behind a massive desk, ROSS looks up.

                         ROSS
                    Mr. August Gorman?








ON GUS -- instantly abject, pleading pitifully.

                         GUS
                    Please, Mr. Webster, you're a
                    great humanitarian. Ain't you
                    heard what it's like in them
                    jails? You send an innocent               
                       boy in and he gets thrown in
                    with killers and robbers and     
                    rapers and raper killer and
                    robber rapers and...

                         ROSS
                    Mr. Gorman, just answer me
                    one question...

GUS braces himself for the worst.

                         ROSS
                    You've been a naughty boy
                    haven't you?
                         (congenial laugh)
                    C'mon now, admit it, you
                    were kinda naughty.

                         GUS
                         (a but surprises
                          at his tone)
                    Uh...yeah. I didn't think of
                    it that way exactly, but...

ROSS rises, walks up to the bookshelf and pushes the spine of one volume. 
Suddenly the entire section of shelving revolves, revealing a complete wet bar 
on the other side. As he does this business, he keeps speaking:

                         ROSS
                    Say, fella, I understand. I 
                    can -- what do the kids say
                    these days -- "dig where
                    you're comin' from."
                         (a chuckle)
                    You want to be rich, right?

                         GUS
                    Uh...

                         ROSS
                    Now me, I was born rich. I've 
                    never worn the same pair of
                    socks twice.

                         GUS
                         (impressed)
                    Yeah? What do you do with 'em?

ROSS has by now poured himself a drink and one for GUS.

                         ROSS
                    I believe they're laundered
                    and sent to some charitable
                    institution. I don't know what
                    the heck they do with 'em. 
                    Maybe they use them for dust 
rags, or pen wipers...

     GUS
Or socks.

     ROSS
Yes! That never occurred to
me.
     (hands him his drink)
Her ya go, buddy, single-malt.          
     (GUS downs it chug-
      a-lug)
Gus, my friend, you're a genius.
Okay, a naughty genius, but hell,
nobody's perfect.

     GUS
'Cause I know about getting' them
half-centses?

ROSS begins to stride about the office as he pontificates, turning away from 
GUS, speaking "to the world." As he does, GUS, feeling more at ease, walks to 
the bar.

                         ROSS
                    Because computers run the
                    world today, pal. And the fella
                    who can fool the computers will
                    run the world himself!

GUS leans against the bar. It instantly revolves, taking him with it, and 
becomes a wall of bookcase again. GUS is now trapped behind it somewhere inside 
the wall. ROSS, who hasn't noticed since his back is to the bar, just keeps on 
talking as if GUS were still there.

                         ROSS
                    I've been searching for a long
                    time for somebody who can
                    make these machines do things
                    they're not supposed to do. Do
                    you catch my drift, brother?

From inside the wall, GUS calls for help; his voice is so muffles, that ROSS 
just takes it for a grunt of assent.





                         ROSS
                    I knew you would. And best of
                    all, you seem to be able to do it
                    in such a way that the deed goes
                    undetected.

At last the bookcase spins around and a shaken GUS steps back in the room, just 
as ROSS turns. He never noticed his absence.

By the time GUS has regained his balance, ROSS is already on his way out of the 
room so that GUS has to rush to catch up with him. As ROSS heads for an 
adjoining room:

                         ROSS
                    Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial
                    complex, is a family-owned cartel.
                    A little magnesium here, a little zinc
                    there. Some railroads here, some
                    farm machinery there. You follow?                    
     
                         GUS
                          (a little out of
                           breath)
                    I'm tryin' to.

ROSS stops in the doorway.

                         ROSS
                          (intensely)
                    Gus, do you know what I want now?
                    I want coffee!

                         GUS
                           (instantly turning
                             to get it)
                    Black or regular?

                         ROSS
                    I don't think you understand.

INT. ROOFTOP ATRIUM - DAY

ROSS and GUSS step into an enormous rooftop botanical garden, about as big as a 
football field, filled with a great profusion of trees, plants, flowers, and 
bushes.

                         GUS
                          (wide-eyed wonder)
                    Man, what is this?

                         ROSS
                    Plants. Plants always make
                    an office cozier.




ROSS waves at a GARDNER pruning some bushes.

                         ROSS
                    Hiya, fella, how's it goin'?
                          (to GUS)
                    Helluva nice guy, been with me
                    for years.

As they stroll, ROSS stops to admire a shrub, or inspect a flower bed, but keeps 
right on talking. 

                         ROSS
                    Under different company names. I 
                    control the price of coffee beans
                    in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. 
Java, South Korea, North Korea,
the Aleutian Islands, Guam,
Bolivia, and the Republic of
Gabon!

     GUS
Decaffeinated too?

As they continue walking, ROSS throws an avuncular, democratic arm around GUS'S 
shoulders.

                         ROSS
                    But y'see, chum, the problem
                    I got is that one country just
                    won't play ball with me.
                        (as if GUS could
                         empathize)
                    You know how that can just
                    bug a guy, don't you?

                         GUS
                    Which country?

                         ROSS
                         (his expression
                          darkens)
                    Columbia.

                         GUS
                    Columbia.

                         ROSS
                    Columbia's got two major
                    exports and one of them's
                    coffee.
                         (Continued)    
                    



                         ROSS (cont.)
     (put-upon)
                    Oh, I tried to reason with 
                    them. Believe me, I tried!
                    But this one miserable piss-
                    ant little country has the gall 
to think they can dictate the
economy of an open market!
       ("reasonably")
Gus, dear Gus, don't you see
what I mean? We have to teach
them a lesson.
        (icy)
Wipe 'em out!!!

     GUS
       (startled)
Wipe 'em out?

     ROSS
Destroy the entire Colombian
coffee crop down to the last bean.

He stops by a shrub, looks down at the soil around it. He frowns, then calls out 
to the GARDNER.

                         ROSS
                    Yo! Over here.

The GARDNER runs over to him.

                         ROSS
                         (suddenly terse, curt)
                    What's this I see? Fallen leaves
                    not picked up? Organic litter?

                         GARDNER
                    Sorry, sir, I was going to do it
                    late--

Without a word, ROSS slaps the MAN sharply across the face. Then, his friendly 
grin appearing again, he puts his arm around GUS and they continue walking as if 
nothing unusual has happened (though, a nervous GUS keeps looking back at the 
GARDNER).

                         ROSS
                    So, fella? You see the problem?









                         GUS
                          (tentatively)
                    But Mr. Webster...you're doin'
                    okay with Brazil and them other
                    places. What's wrong with just
                    one little old country doin' their
                    own thing?

                         ROSS
                    A very wise man once said...I
                    think it was Attila the Hun...
                    "It's not enough that I succeed.
                    Everyone else must fail."
                          (he snaps a rose
                            in half; GUS jumps)
                    And you are going to do it for me.

                         GUS
                          (scared)
                    Me? How?

Their tour of the atrium has brought them back to where they started from, the 
connecting door tot he office. The voice of VERA, o.s., announces her presence 
there.          

                         VERA (o.s.)
                    The weather!

INT. ROSS'S OFFICE - DAY

As ROSS and GUS come back into the office, GUS  catches his first glimpse of 
VERA, looking forbidding.

ON GUS -- he instantly shrinks back from this creature.

                         GUS
                          (to ROSS)
                    Hey listen, I didn't know your
                    mama was comin' by...
          
     VERA
      (furious)
Sister! I'm his sister!

     ROSS
      (to GUS)
                    Gus, tell me, have you ever heard
                    of Vulcan?

                         GUS
                          (to VERA)
                    That what they call you?




                         VERA
                          (through her teeth)
     Vulcan is the weather satellite                              our 
government put up in orbit
     to monitor the weather.

          ROSS
           (eagerly)
     But if somebody re-programmed
     it, it could do much more.

          VERA
     It could make weather!

          ROSS
     Storms! Floods!

          VERA
     Blizzards! Heat waves!

          GUS
     How do you do that?

          ROSS
     Like everything else in the 20th
     century, Gus. You push buttons.

INT. DAILY PLANET - DAY

INSERT: a finger is pushing a button. It's JIMMY OLSEN taking a picture as he 
says:

                         JIMMY
                    Smile!

FULL SHOT -- The subjects of JIMMY'S photo are smiling so hard their cheeks 
might burst. They are MR. and MRS. MAURY STOKIS, the winners of the JINGO 
contest. Clad in resort outfits, they are standing beneath a poster emblazoned 
"JINGO WINNERS!"

                         MR. STOKIS
                    I can't believe it! It's the first
                    time I ever won anything!

                         MRS. STOKIS
                         (kittenish)
                    You won my hand, Maury.

                         MR. STOKIS
                    Yeah, sure, but this is the first
                    time I ever won anything valuable!

NEW ANGLE -- revealing JIMMY, who has his leg in a cast. He hobbles about his 
equipment, clearly not thrilled with his assignment. Standing nearby are MISS 
HENDERSON, looking delighted, and PERRY WHITE. looking like he'd give anything 
to escape.

                         MISS HENDERSON
                    Let's get one with the sombreros, 
                    Olsen.

She pops the outsized sombreros on the heads of the happy couple. They instantly 
strike a Latin pose and grin steadily at the camera.

                         MISS HENDERSON
                         (an inspiration)
                    Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing
                    them their plane tickets.

                         PERRY
                         (miserable)
                    Why do I have to do this?

                         JIMMY
                         (miserable)
                    Why do I have to do this?

                         PERRY
                    You! You're lucky I didn't fire you.
                    I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot 
pictures of the biggest forest fire in
history and what does he come back 
with??? A broken leg and twelve
melted rolls of film.

     JIMMY
It was hot!

     MISS HENDERSON
Smile, Mr. White.

     MR. STOKIS
South America! I can't believe my
luck!

They freeze in the pose as the flashbulb goes off.

INT. ROSS WEBSTER'S OFFICE - DAY

GUS, ROSS, and VERA as we left them.

                         ROSS
                    Computers talk to other computers,
                    right?

                         VERA
                    Somehow your twisted little mind
                    should be able to figure out how to
                    tap into the main computer at the 
                    Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.


                         GUS
                         (immediately)                    
                    Through the telephone line
                    terminal, that ain't nothin'.

                         VERA
                         (excited)                    
                    Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.

                         GUS
                    What she call you?

                         ROSS
                    Bubba.
                         (GUS ties not
                          to snicker)
                    When she was three years old
                    she couldn't pronounce the word
                    'brother' and it came out 'Bubba.'
                         (grimly)
                    It was the last cute thing she ever
                    did.

Without knocking, as usual, LORELEI bursts into the office.

                         LORELEI
                    Did I hear somebody say "cute
                    thing?"

GUS is stupefied at the sight of her.

                          VERA
                         (annoyed)
                    She's not his mama either.

                         ROSS
                    Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic
Nutritionist.

                         LORELEI
                    You're cute too.

                         GUS
                    I'm cool. I ain't cute. it ain't
                    cool to be cute.

GUS sits down by the oversized chess set. Unthinkingly, he reaches out and moves 
one of the black pieces. immediately three of the white pieces begin to shift 
squares automatically realigning themselves in a new defense by some electronic 
gadgetry. Startled, GUS backs away.





NEW ANGLE -- As ROSS stares at GUS'S reaction, behind him LORELEI has happily 
plunked herself in his chair behind the desk. The right hand top drawer is open 
and she reaches in to take a Kleenex when VERA, seeing her opportunity , comes 
by swiftly and slams the drawer closed with her knee, smashing LORELEI'S 
fingers. The later lets out a shriek and pulls her hand, waving her fingers 
wildly. ROSS turns to see what's the matter.

                         VERA
                    She's drying her nails.

LORELEI smile through her pain, keeps shaking her hand in the air.

                         ROSS
                         (quickly)
                    Always making yourself
                    beautiful for me, aren't you?
                            (turns back to GUS)
                    So, Gus, can you make Vulcan 
do what I want it to? You didn't
answer me, pal.
     (as GUS hesitates)
Did you hear about that prison
riot last week? It seems they
were complaining about rats
in the cells...

     GUS
     (quickly)
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.

     ROSS
When?

     GUS
First question got to be
"Where."

     ROSS
What?

     GUS
Not "What." Don't need a genius
to figure out "what." Need a 
genius to figure out "where."
     (A bit boastfully
      to VERA)
He says I'm a genius, your don --
                         (quickly)
                    Brother! Bubba! Your Bubba!
                         (as she calms down)
                    See, if y'all don't want them to
                    trace it back, you got to punch
                    this in from someplace nobody'd
                    ever think off. Some little rinky-
                    dink operation with a little mickey-
                    mouse computer.
                         ROSS
                    It's got to be someplace you can
                    sneak into.

                         VERA
                    Someplace where nobody knows him
                    so they can't connect him with us.

                         ROSS
                    Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve
                    subsidiaries and every one of them is
                    tied to our central computer system.
                    How about...hmmmm, someplace
                    small...

EXT. CORNER GROCERY STORE, SMALLVILLE - DAY

TIGHT ON THE WORD "Smallville" painted on a sign. PUL BACK AND WIDEN TO SEE THE 
ENTIRE SIGN: "Smallville Groceries."

WIDE SHOT -- The main shopping area of Smallville. In B.G. LANA is just coming 
out of the grocery store, carrying a bag of picnic supplies. In F.G. RIGHT, 
CLARK sits in the front seat of her 5-year \-old Chevy. RICKY is in back, 
playing with his very frisky puppy, BUSTER. In F.G. LEFT a Greyhound Bus is 
discharging some PASSENGERS, many carrying suitcases.

CLOSER ON THE CAR -- as CLARK sees LANA struggling with the door to the store 
and hefting her bag of supplies.

                         CLARK
                    I'll give your mom a hand.

NEW ANGLE -- he flings open the car door and it slams hard against the knee of a 
MAN who just got off the bus. The GUY howls with pain.
                         
                         CLARK
                        (abashed)
                    Oh, I'm sorry.

As the MAN limps off, muttering, we realize it's GUS GORMAN, wearing his same 
old beat-up windbreaker and slacks, but now carrying a Vuitton valise. FOLLOW 
GUS, as he walks across some railroad tracks that run through the center of 
town, looking around at his surroundings.

                         GUS
                         (bitching, aloud)
                    Welcome to nowhere, U.S.A.

In B.G. LANA and CLARK get in the car and drive off. HOLD ON GUS. FOLLOW HIM as 
he sets off down Main Street, passing a Sears type store, glancing up at the 
window display. A mannequin-like giant Ken doll in a green and white polyester 
leisure suit is grinning down at him. GUS shudders from the bottom of his soul.



HOLD CAMAERA STAIONARY as SEEN FROM BEHIND, shoulders bowed, he trudges down 
Main Street and off into the distance.

EXT. COUNTY CLEAING - DAY     

EXTREME LONG SHOT -- In a clearing on the edge of acres of waving wheat, CLARK 
and LANA and RICKY and BUSTER the puppy are ensconced between her car, which is 
parked on the side of the road, and a picket fence that marks the boundary of a 
farm.

CLOSER -- On their picnic blanket LANA is proudly setting out a lot of small 
plastic containers of homemade goodies as CLARK sprinkles salt on a celery 
stalk.

                         CLARK
                         (happily)
                    Gee, I haven't done this in
                    years.

                         LANA     
                    Some people don't think it's
                    healthy.

                         CLARK
                         (earnestly nodding)
                    Well, it's true you have to be
                    careful things don't spoil,
                    especially with mayonnaise 
                    or cream.

                         LANA
                    Clark, I think you worry too
                    much about mayonnaise.

                         CLARK
                    Me??

                         LANA
                    I'm talking about salt.
                         (as he hesitates
                          uncertainly)
                    Oh, go ahead, pour it on,
                    relax. That's what picnics
                    are for.

NEW ANGLE -- including RICKY, who is pulling a ball out of his pocket while 
BUSTER waits, wagging his tail, beside him.

                         RICKY
                    Don't they have picnics in
                    Metropolis, Mr. Kent?






                         CLARK
                    Well...
                         (looking around at 
                          the open fields, clean
                          air, blue sky)     
                    Not quite like this.

                         RICKY
                    Mom and I do this all the time.

And he goes racing off with BUSTER, OUT OF FRAME.

                         LANA
                         (to CLARK)
                    It's nice for Ricky.

CLARK settles in next to her, beginning to open plastic containers.

                         LANA
                         (enjoying the
                          proximity)
                    And even nicer when there's
                    a man around, Which isn't all
that often.

     CLARK
     (re the plastic
      containers)
There's a lot of choices here.

     LANA
No, all the good ones are
married. That's why Brad
thinks he's God's gift to
women. This woman anyway.
He's single. He won't take no 
for an answer, but he's the only
one who's asking. And he knows it.

     CLARK
     (trying to straighten
      out the conversation)
I meant all the choices here. All
this --
     (lifting lids)
-- cole slaw, guacamole --
                        (more and more
                         impressed as he
                         opens for containers)
                    This is some picnic!





CAMERA PANS AWAY FROM CLARK, LOSING HIM FROM THE SHOT, AND MOVES TO LANA JUST AS 
RICKY RUNS TO HER. LANA is still beaming from CLARK'S praise, as:
               
                         CLARK
                    Hey mom, how about me?          

LANA finds -- in the middle of this feast -- a lone, wax paper wrapped sandwich 
and hands it to RICKY with a mock sigh. As he takes off again:

TWO SHOT -- LANA turns back to CLARK. Holding a fork and a plastic container, he 
has just sampled something he's not quite sure about.

                         LANA
                    Peanut butter and jelly.

                         CLARK
                    No, thanks.

                         LANA
                    No, I mean Ricky. He's not
                    interested in any of this stuff.

                         CLARK
                    Well, this pate is rather...unusual.

                         LANA
                    Pate? What pate?
                        (leaning over -- very
                         close to him now --
                         to peer into the
                           container)
                    I didn't make any --
                        (horrified pause;
                         then)
                    Oh, no, Clark. That's Buster's
                    dog food.

CLARK looks at the container, looks at his fork, looks at LANA. The look on his 
face is just too much for her. She starts to laugh. Then he starts to laugh. 
They stop -- and then start again. She collapses against him, weak with 
laughter.

And even when their mirth subsides, they don't move apart.

                         LANA
                    Gee, I haven't laughed like that
                    since -- since --
                        (she suddenly realizes)
                    I really can't remember when.

                         CLARK
                    Me neither...

Their proximity suddenly makes them self-conscious. They move apart and try to 
lighten the moment, a bit awkwardly:
                         LANA
                    So...how much longer do you
                    think you'll be in Smallville --

                         CLARK
                         (his dialogue overlaps
                          hers, starts a few
                          beats back)
                    You know, I was just thinking,
                    Lana -- 
                         (the following line     
                          is in the clear)
                    -- someone like you could do
                    do really well in Metropolis --

They both stop, smile a bit shyly at each other.

Sound: nearby, the steady, grinding motor of a giant thresher in the wheat 
fields.

EXT. WHEAT FIELDS: LONG SHOT of the enormous thresher cutting through the wheat, 
its great blades and rollers turning.

ON THE PICNIC: over the noise, LANA and CLARK are continuing their tete-a-tete.

                         LANA
                    I suppose I've got to face it --
                    I'm not going to find what I
                    want in Smallville anymore, but --
               
Sound: the thresher gets closer and louder.

                         LANA
                         (impatiently)
                    I can never get a way from it.

                         CLARK
                         (following her thought
                          about Smallville;
                          nodding understandingly)
                    Old ties are hard to cut.

                         LANA
                    No. I mean, yes they are, but I     
                    was talking about that.
                         (she cocks her head towards
                           the insistent sound)
                    Wheat King. Bet your bottom 
                    dollar that's a Wheat King 
                    thresher.
                         (continued)





                         LANA
                         (thoughtfully)
                    That's the biggest change in
                    Smallville, you know. They've
                    taken over this town. Everybody
                    who isn't actually working for
                    Wheat King -- like I do -- is out
                    there --
                         (gesturing towards
                          the fields)
                    on a Wheat King thresher.
                         (back to their
                          conversation; she
                          looks up at him eagerly)
                    Do you think I could do it? Do you?

                         CLARK
                         (dubiously)
                    Ride a thresher? Well, I don't 
know. Girls are trying just about 
everything now but --

     LANA
No, what you said before, Could I 
make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed
about it, sure, but I never really
thought about it.
     (uncertainly)
What would I do when I got there?

     CLARK
      (smiling)
Call me.

     LANA
      (quietly thrilled)
Oh, I wouldn't want to -- I mean,
I'd want to, but I wouldn't want 
to...be a nuisance to you.

ON RICKY -- about twenty feet away, having his own good time, tussling happily 
with his PUPPY in the tall grass.

TWO SHOT -- CLARK and LANA

                         CLARK
                          (quietly)
                    Hey, you could never be a nuisance.

She touches his knee gently. She moves toward him, closer.





                         LANA
                          (softly)
                    Clark, may I tell you something?
                          (as he waits, she looks
                           away for a moment)
                    My oil pan is leaking.

He reacts with considerable confusion; it wasn't what he expected.

                         LANA
                    See?
                          (she points under
                           the car)

POV: A small puddle under the CHEVY is getting larger, dark drops falling slowly 
but steadily into it as:

                         LANA (o.s.)
                    See? There's something dripping.

NEW ANGLE -- As LANA gets up, in B.G. we SEE BUSTER the dog run off into the 
wheat.

                         RICKY
                    Hey, Buster! Darn it... come
                    back, willya?

But the DOG runs on and RICKY starts to chase him into the fields. HOLS ON LANA 
and CLARK.

                         LANA
                    The dog's always doing that.
                          (wryly, pointing to
                           the leaky Chevy)
                    And the car's always doing that.

                         CLARK
                    Can I help? 

LANA opens the trunk, takes out a tool kit.

                         LANA
                    No thanks. With all the trouble
                    this thing gives me, I started
                    studying up on auto repair. 

She slides under the car and begins tapping the undercarriage with a wrench, 
listening carefully. 
     
ON CLARK -- watching her, smiling.

Sound: the thresher grinds a way, coming and going, closer now and louder than 
LANA'S tapping.

But CLARK suddenly hears something else. He sits up, frowns, cocks his head 
towards the wheat fields.

EFFECTS: Shimmery light waves coming from his ear denote Super-Hearing in 
action. 

What he (and we) now HEARS: the plaintive insistent whining of BUSTER out in the 
fields. Troubled, he turns in that direction, scanning the area.

POV: SPECIAL EFFECTS: X-Ray Vision sees through the thick golden wheat, 
searching till it finds the PUPPY sitting, whimpering, beside RICKY, who lays 
unconscious, completely hidden among rows of tall grain. ZOOM CLOSER TO RICKY -- 
chasing BUSTER, he has tripped and fallen, hitting his head on a jagged stone 
jutting out of the earth beside him. There is a cut on the side of his head and 
he doesn't move.

Sound: suddenly the grinding, thrashing noise of the giant threshing machine 
seems very close.

AERIAL SHOT: LOOKING DOWN, we SEE the big thresher heading for the plot of land 
where little RICKY lays unseen.

EXT. WHEAT FIELD - DAY

LOW ANGLE -- RICKY in F.G., the big thresher coming fast towards him from B.G.

EXT. COUNTRY CLEARING - DAY

CLARK glances over at LANA, but she, of course, has heard nothing unusual from 
underneath the car and goes on tinkering.
                         
                         CLARK
                    Think I'll see if I can help
                    Ricky.

He gets up and moves casually but very quickly towards the picket fence. Sure 
that LANA is safely out of sight doing her work, he darts behind the fence.

EFFECTS: As he runs behind the fence, CLARK KENT turns into SUPERMAN. The effect 
of the picket railings is like a strobe or time-lapse, i.e., as he passes behind 
each rail more and more of the SUPERMAN FIGURE begins to emerge from the CLARK 
FIGURE. By the time he has reached the end of the fence...it's SUPERMAN! He 
zooms into the sky.

EXT. SKY - DAY

ON SUPERMAN, looking down.

HIS POV: the big thresher is getting closer, closer to the unconscious CHILD.

FULL SHOT -- SUPERMAN swoops down.

IN VARIOUS QUICK CUTS:

1. LOW ANGLE -- the thresher comes closer.
The noise is deafening.


2. ON THE FRONT OF THE THRESHER -- we can
clearly see how formidable the rolling blades are.
They would chew the CHILD up in seconds.

3. Accelerating, SUPERMAN dives down, lands
in front of the thresher and...

4. Reaches out with both hands and just grabs the
churning blades, stopping it abruptly.

5. ON THE THRESHER DRIVER in his cab, startled
to find himself coming to a sudden, jolting stop.

6. SUPERMAN scoops up the unconscious RICKY in
his arms, flies up into the air with him.

7. RICKY comes to in mid-air, opens his eyes and
is surprised to say the least.

                    RICKY
               Superman???

                    SUPERMAN
               That's what they call me.

8. The thresher DRIVER, in his cab, mops his brow
at the near miss.

9. SUPERMAN and RICKY coming towards the 
parked car.

ON THE CAR -- LANA still underneath.

                         RICKY (o.s.)
                    Mom!  Mom!

LANA slides out from under, and is astonished at what she sees...SUPERMAN 
landing with her SON in his arms.

                         LANA
                               (dumbfounded)
                    Ricky?  Where...what...

                         SUPERMAN
                               (indicates the cut)
                    I'd wash that out with some
                    iodine...
                              (RICKY winces)
                    Okay, Mercurochrome.

                         LANA
                              (trying to recover
                                the power of speech)
                    Thank ...you.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Anytime.

RICKY gazes at him in wonder.

                         LANA
                    Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is 
                    Ricky.

                         SUPERMAN
                    We've already met.

                         LANA
                    And this is...
                             (she looks around
                               for CLARK)
                    ...Clark.
                             (to SUPERMAN)
                    My friend is around here
                    somewhere, I'll just look for...          

                         SUPERMAN
                              (kindly)
                    I'm sorry, I'm in a real hurry.
                              (to RICKY)
                    See you around, pal.

With a smile and a wave, SUPERMAN takes off. Whoosh. And he's gone from sight.

                         RICKY
                              (still in a spell)
                    We were flying!! Mom! In the sky!

                         LANA
                             (trying  to make 
                               sense of all this)
                    What were you doing anyway?

                         RICKY
                    I was looking for...
                              (remembering, suddenly     
                                looks around, calling)
                    Buster!  Buster!

Sound: Distant sound of yelping dog.

ON THE WHEAT FIELD -- backing out, ass-first and on his hands and knees, from an 
open-ended length of big irrigation pipe comes a disheveled CLARK KENT, holding 
the PUPPY in his arms. He stands up with difficulty and raises the DOG high in 
the air for them to see in B.G.





                         CLARK
                              (calling)
                    I found him!

NEW ANGLE -- as LANA and RICKY run to CLARK

                         RICKY
                    Mr. Kent! Superman was here!

                         CLARK
                            (looking incredulous)
                    What!

                         LANA
                    He really was!

                         CLARK
                              (calmly)
                    Uh-huh.

                         LANA
                    Well, aren't you excited?

                         CLARK
                    Lana, I'm from Metropolis.
                    I see Superman every day.

EXT. WHEAT KING INDUSTRIAL PARK, MAIN OFFICES - NIGHT

WIDE, ESTABLISHING SHOT of one of those typical, sprawling industrial parks 
located on the outskirts of communities all across America. The billboard in 
front shows a picture of a FARMER on a tractor and says:

"WHEAT KING FARM MACHINERY
A WEBCO COMPANY."

CLOSER -- A remarkable sight: standing at the front door, ringing insistently on 
a button marked "Night Bell" is a totally transformed GUS GORMAN. He now is 
attired in the very green-and-white polyester suit that caused him to recoil at 
first sight. His look and persona are that of a typical midwestern 
salesman...fast-talking, hard-selling, and square. He carries a very large 
suitcase.

INT. WHEAT KING BUILDING - NIGHT

After a moment, we SEE BRAD, in nightwatchman outfit, stumbling down the 
corridor, already tipsy. He walks through a microphone gizmo embedded about 
halfway down the glass door.

                         BRAD
                    Yeah? What do you want?

                         GUS
                    Buddy, are we in trouble.


                         BRAD
                        (has no idea what in
                         hell he's talking about)
                    What?

                         GUS
                        (talking very fast,
                         giving the befuddled
                         BRAD no chance to 
                         interrupt)
                    First the supplier couldn't find
                    the invoice. Then the order came
                    up short. Then I missed the four     
                    o'clock plane from Cleveland and
                    had to rent a car, and then I got a
                    darn flat tire on the highway! Can
                    you beat it? Boy, your boss must've
                    been furious when I didn't show up
                    by the end of the day today, huh?

ON BRAD -- in his befogged mind, he senses that something is wrong, but he has 
no idea what in hell it means.

                         BRAD
                    What are you talkin' about?

                         GUS
                    Good lord, fella! I'm talking about
                    your boss.

                         BRAD
                    Mr. Roebush?

                         GUS
                          (seemingly frantic
                            with worry)
                    Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's
                    gonna nail our behinds to the wall!
                    this is Special Order! He said he had
to have it before...
        (a sudden realization)
Omigod!! What's tomorrow?

     BRAD
Tuesday.

     GUS
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up
in his office tonight before all those
big shots come here tomorrow for
the meeting!!




ON BRAD -- shaking his head, trying to clear it.

                         BRAD
                    Get all what set up?

ON GUS -- with a wild smile and a glint in his eye like Robert Helpmann holding 
out The Red Shoes, he snaps open the lid of the valise. Four shelves, 
"accordioned" in tiers, spring forward: they contain bottles of every known 
liquor, whiskey, and spirit     in the world, plus various bartending implements 
(shakers, stirrers, etc). As GUS grins like the terrible tempter:

ON BRAD -- the expression on his face is a wonder to behold. The simple 
anticipatory greedy delight of a child on Christmas morning. A second later the 
glass doors slide open with an electronic whoosh.

INT. WHEAT KING PLANT MANAGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Some time later. DUS and BRAD are seated at the boss's desk. An incredible array 
of liquor bottles in evidence, and all open, their contents sampled. A similar 
line-up of different size glasses, all used and empty. GUS in the style of a 
slick bartender. Both GUYS are blotto, BRAD a little more so. GUS pours the new 
concoction into a glass. BRAD samples it.

                         BRAD
                    S'not bad, s'very good, but...
                    y'know what's wrong with this...
                    Singapore...thing?

                         GUS
                    Sling. Singapore Sling. What's
               wrong?

                    BRAD
               Not enough vodka in it.

                    GUS
               There's no vodka in it.

                    BRAD
               Aha! What'd I tell ya!

                    GUS
               What? What did you tell me?

BRAD considers this a while, then holds out his glass.

                    BRAD
               Put vodka in it.

GUS does so, liberally. BRAD takes a big swig.

                    BRAD
               S'better. Taste it.



                    GUS
                      (sips)
               Got vodka in it now. Gotta 
               give it a new name. Hey, listen, 
               you thought it up, we'll name it 
after you. What's your name?

     BRAD
Brad.

     GUS
     (considers it)
Brad is not a good name for a
cocktail.

     BRAD
     (an idea occurs)
Hey! Y'know what they used to
call me in high school?

     GUS
Brad?

     BRAD
No, no, on the football field.
They called me...
     (drawing himself up
       with boozy pride)
...The Smallville Flash.

     GUS
Hey, man, that's a great name
for a cocktail!

They clink glasses in celebration.

                         GUS
                    Here's to the Smallville Flash!

BRAD chug-a-lugs his drink, draining the glass. GUS watches him in drunken 
amazement.

                         GUS
                    Man, you don't never pass out,
                    do ya?

                         BRAD
                    Nope.
                          (he closes his eyes)
                    Never.
                          (and he passes out)

NEW ANGLE -- GUS prods him, sees he's out cold. Now the problem is trying to get 
on with his business in the highly inebriated state he's in.


                         GUS
                    Awright. Keys.

He goes over to BRAD, removes the key ring from his belt, starts going through 
all the keys.

INSERT: Each key is marked with a tag for its location. There are two plastic 
keys marked Computer - A and Computer - B.

                         GUS
                        (mumbling, puzzled)
                    Two keys? Lessee about that...

He starts out of the room, takes one look back...BRAD totally comatose now, has 
slumped down in his chair, half on the floor.

                         GUS
                    Huh. The Smallville Flash.

INT. CORRIDOR. WHEAT KING OFFICES - NIGHT

GUS makes his way, very drunkenly, down the corridors, weaving as he walks. 
FOLLOW HIM as he turns a corner, where an unexpected mirror causes him to jump 
back in horror, like W.C. Fields doing a take. It's the suit with him in it that 
makes him shiver and say:

                         GUS
                    Man, that is terrifyingly ugly...

He enters a room above which is a sign: COMPUTER and beneath it another sign: 
SNACKS.

INT. WHEAT KING VENDING MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

A row of coin-operated vending machines. GUS is just drunk enough to carefully 
check each one out to make sure.

                         GUS
                       (addressing the 
                         coffee machine)
                    You ain't the computer, man.
                        (goes to candy
                          machine, examines it)               
                    You ain't neither.
                          (the soft drink
                            dispenser)
                    Not even close.

he continues along the wall with the careful gait of a man trying to remain 
upright, he stops before a doorway and opens it. A broom and a mop fall out.







ANGLE IN -- it's a miniscule, five foot high broom closet, filled with cleaning 
utensils, buckets, etc.

                         GUS
                       (as the broom
                         falls out)
                    S'cuse me.

He puts the stuff back, shuts the door, opens one remaining door. Inside a small 
room is the office of Xerox copier, an office supplies cabinet, and a small 
computer console. It's just as he asked for: A little rinky-dink computer 
operation.

                         GUS
                    There's that sucker!

He enters.

INT. WHEAT KING COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

GUS sits down in front of the keyboard, shakes his head trying to sober up, 
looks down, remembers the key.

INSERT: he laboriously inserts one of the plastic keys in its slot.

ON GUS -- he starts to touch keyboard buttons. Nothing happens.

                         GUS
                    Hey, c'mon, man!
                         (tries again,
                           no success)
Now a sign on the wall above the console catches his eye. He looks up at it.

GUD POV: The vision, impaired by booze, is blurry at first. Then double-vision. 
Then it comes into focus.

               TWO KEYS REQUIRED TO OPERATE.
               KEY - A IN STATION #1
               KEY - B IN STATION #2
               BOTH KEYS MUST BE INSERTED
               AT THE SAME TIME

Muttering his displeasure, GUS stands up, wobbly, and looks for Station # 2. he 
finds it on the other end of the console. As he starts to try and insert the 
second key, he remembers:

                         GUS
                    "At the same time." Oh.

He holds one key, poised to enter its slot, and reaches around, stretching 
himself out, spreading his legs, trying to insert the second key in its slot. 
But the distance is too great for one man to do it.

                         GUS
                    Damn! Now what'll I do?

                                             CUT TO:
INT. WHEAT KING PLANT MANAGER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

ON BRAD -- as we left him, passed out cold.

GUS ENTERS FRAME, shakes BRAD, trying to rouse him.

                         GUS
                    Hey, brother! Hey, Flash!
                         (shakes harder, but
                           it's useless)
                    Shee...

Grasping BRAD beneath his arm pits, GUS starts to drag the massive bulk out of 
the office.

INT. WHEAT KING COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

GUS hauls BRAD into the computer room, shoves him in the general area of Station 
#2, then, with considerable trial and effort, attempts to put the second key in 
his hand and clench his fingers around it. The general idea is this...

GUS must maneuver it so that both keys are inserted simultaneously. in order to 
do this, he must position BRAD...a passed-out BRAD...so that he falls forward at 
the proper angle to insert one of the keys as GUS inserts his. His first two 
tries meet with total failure; BRAD slumps to the floor and/or collapses 
backwards. Finally, GUS comes up with his own tipsy solution: to keep BRAD erect 
and correctly positioned, he uses hi yo-yo, ties one end on BRAD, goes back to 
STATION #1, holding his end of the string, then gently pulls BRAD forward at 
just the right angles so that his key and GUS'S key enter the computer together. 
As they do, the display screen lights up and spells out:

                    HELLO

                         GUS
                    Now you wanna be friends, huh?

He starts to type a program on the console. As he does:

                         GUS
                        (to himself)
                    C'mon now, Gus, sober up.

C.U. KEYBOARD -- as his fingers touch buttons.

INT. VARIOUS COMPUTERS

A SERIES OF SHOTS of different computers in different places turning and 
flashing and beeping, etc. Again, the intent is clear: GUS'S computer is 
contacting other computers.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Some anonymous office. A computer is evidence. A bell rings. A video display 
screen lights up.

               "NEW INFORMATION: INCOMING"

CAMERA ON REAR OF MACHINE: showing the wiring leading out. PAN ALONG CABLE TO:

EXT. STREET. CURB OUTSIDE BANK - NIGHT

FULL SHOT -- we are on a city street corner by an Instant Cash Machine on the 
side of a bank.

A GUY, ordinary, dressed in jeans and a faded sweatshirt, walks up to the 
machine and takes a plastic bank card from his wallet.

CLOSER ON HIM AND THE MACHINE -- he inserts it in the proper slot. The digital 
display flashes the usual instructions:

1. ENTER SECRET CODE
(the GUY pushes his code)
          
2. SELECT MODE: DEPSOIT, WITHDRAWAL
SAVINGS, CHECKING.
  (the GUY pushes the 
   "Withdrawal" button) 
          
3. AMOUNTS: $30,  $50,  $70,  $100.

The GUY pushes the $50 button and stands and waits.

SOUND: the thunk that lets you know money has dropped into the cash drawer.

ANGLE DOWN -- he opens the cash drawer. The packet of $50 in small bills is 
there. But as the GUY starts to reach for it: thunk. Another fifty bucks. Thunk. 
Another. And another and another and another and another...

C.U. the GUY -- his eyes widen in astonishment.

TIGHT ANGLE --  the money keeps dropping into the drawer.

PAN UP-- the GUY stifles a yelp of joy, not wanting to call attention to 
himself. He stuffs money in every available packet as fast as he can, as the 
cash keeps dropping into the drawer. he smiles nonchalantly at passers by as he 
keeps filling up.

INT. WHEAT KING COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

GUS shakes his head, no, and pushes another key.

ON THE VIDEO DISPLAY -- it reads. "CLEAR, NEW PROGRAM."

ON GUS -- starts again.

INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

SHOTS of computers at work.




INT. DEPARTMENT STORE BILLING OFFICE - DAY

The lettering on the office door reads:

MACY'S CUSTOMER BILLING DEPT.

ON A COMPUTERIZED MACHINE dispensing bills to be mailed out to customers.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY

A HUSBAND sits at the breakfast table, looking at the day's mail. His breakfast, 
including a half-grapefruit, in front of him. HIS WIFE, in housecoat, seated 
opposite.

INSERT: He tears open the Macy's Envelope, pulls out the bill. It lists charges 
for $176,784.57.

FULL SHOT -- without a word, he picks up the grapefruit and jams in into his 
wife's kisser.

EXT. LANA'S HOUSE - DAY

CLARK KENT, holding a little bouquet, stands on the porch of a typical 
Midwestern house. LANA, in her apron, has come out to welcome him. They are 
looking at an old-fashioned porch swing.

                         CLARK
                    Gee, I always loved porch swings.

                         LANA
                    Me too. That's why I put this
                    one up.

She sits in it toward the middle. he comes over and...slightly shy...sits more 
towards one side. The swing instantly tilts toward that side. LANA uphill, CLARK 
downhill.

                         LANA
                    Maybe it's be better if you moved
                    over here a little...

CLARK slides over until the swing levels off. He is very close to LANA. She 
smiles up at him. And just at that moment:

NEW ANGLE -- the door opens and RICKY sticks his head out. CLARK and LANA move 
imperceptibly apart.

                         RICKY
                    Hey, you wanna see my room, 
                    Mr. Kent?






                         LANA
                        (a little smile)
                    He decorated it himself.
                         (now she means
                           the swing)
                    Should have used chains instead
                    of rope.

CLARK, lost again, shakes his head.

INT. RICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

ON CLARK -- For a brief moment, a bit taken  aback by what he sees.

WHAT HE SEES: A perfectly ordinary kid's bedroom, which is not surprisingly, 
hung with large posters of SUPERMAN that seem to be looking right back at CLARK.

C.U. CLARK -- the fleeting smile on his face seems to mean, "life is sure funny 
sometimes."

TWO SHOT

                         RICKY
                    Do you really know Superman?

                         CLARK
                        (lightly)
                    We get together sometimes.

RICKY nods. he sits on the edge of his bed, just looking thoughtfully at CLARK. 
Finally:

                         RICKY
                    Mr. Kent, could I ask you something?

                         CLARK
                        (ready for anything)
                    Sure.

                         RICKY
                    Could you get me Superman's 
                    autograph?

EXT. WHEAT KING INDUSTRIAL PARK - NIGHT

LONG SHOT -- All is quiet.

INT. WHEAT KING VENDING MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT

Nobody is here. PAN to broom closet door. It slowly opens. GUS emerges after 
spending the entire day wedged in the tiny, narrow space. He's bent in what 
looks like a permanent 45-degree angle. He's miserable, unshaven, uncomfortable 
and...most of all...hungover. One of the all-time hangovers. Moaning and 
groaning, he steps out, tries to straighten up and fails. Then he sort of 
manages.



                         GUS
                         (clutching his head)
                    Oh, God, this is worse'n being drunk.

A broom falls. The noise makes him wince.

                         GUS
                    Worse'n being dead.

Looks at himself in mirror of vending machine, shudders, sticks out his tongue, 
examines it with horror.

                         GUS
                    Black coffee. That's what I 
                    need.
                        (gets coins from
                          pocket)
                    Gotta have it. Gotta...

He puts coins in the Hot Coffee machine. Click. Buzz.

ON THE MACHINE -- attached to the side are a stack of removable plastic cup 
holders. But GUS doesn't realize he has to take one and hold it in the inset to 
catch the cup that will drop. The cup that drops is a pointed cone type. Quickly 
GUS grabs it to steady it; an instant later scalding hot coffee fills the cup.

ON GUS -- yanking his hand out, holding the burning paper cup, in great pain. He 
can't hold onto it, puts it down on the machine's top, and it spills coffee on 
him.

                         GUS
                        (angry)
                    I know that be Colombian coffee!
                    I just know it!
                         (menacingly)
                    Gonna fix your wagon, man.

He goes to the computer room.

INT. WHEAT KING COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

He partially inserts both plastic card keys in their slots. Then as he pushes 
one in by hand, he karate kicks the other in. He sits down at the keyboard, 
shakes his head and starts to punch a program on the console. As he does:

ON VIDEO DISPLAY:          "HELLO"

                         GUS
                    Ah, shut up.

He pushes some keys.

                         GUS
                    Gonna get this thing right
                    if it kills me.

INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS

More computers flashing and turning and working.

EXT. CITY STREET. INTERSECTION - DAY

ON A LOT OF PEDESTRIANS standing on the corner of a busy city intersection, 
looking at the traffic light.

ON THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL -- one of those types that has a little figure of a 
standing man that lights up red for DON'T WALK and a figure of a walking man 
that lights up green for WALK. The green man lights up.

ON THE PEOPLE -- they start to cross the street. On the intersecting corner, a 
similar CROWD of PEOPLE waits for the light to change so they can cross. 
SUDDENLY:

ON THE LIGHT -- the green light man goes off and the red light man comes on.

ON THE STREET -- caught in the middle of the street, the walking PEOPLE obey the 
signal and stop. The CROWD on the other corner, obeying their sign, start to 
walk.

VARIOUS ANGLES -- halfway across, the light changes again. The first GROUP tries 
to continue walking, but bumps into the second GROUP, now standing in their way.

ON THE SIGNAL -- completely out of control now, thanks to computer malfunction, 
it goes from little green Walk Man to little Red Stop Man with no discernable 
logic.

ON THE STREET -- it's like a ballet of confusion, as the hapless PEDESTRIANS 
bang into each other.

ON THE LIGHT -- as the signals keep switching back and forth:

EFFECTS: ANIMATION -- the little Red Man loses his temper and reaches down and 
socks the Little Green Man. The Little Green Man hits him back.

Chaos and confusion.

INT. WHAT KING COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

A very frustrated GUS seated at his little computer, trying it one more time.

                         GUS
                        (to the gods above)
                    Oh please, let this be the one...

ON THE DISPLAY SCREEN -- GUS types in (and the digital letters and numbers 
show):

                    XYR8US
                          (after a moment)
                    X3

The machine makes a little noise, then the word appears:

                    INPOERATIVE.

                         GUS     
                         (despair)
                    Oh, no...

He tries again:

                    XYR8US
                          (after a moment)
                    X4

A long pause. the machine makes a slightly different noise. And then, on the 
video display screen, comes the message:

                    HELLO. VULCAN WEATHER
                    SATTELITE.
                    CONFIRMED.

ON GUS -- triumphant at last.

                         GUS
                    I am a genius.

ON VISDEO DISPLAY SCREEN

                    "REQUEST COORDINATES"

GUS types in some stuff. A new message appears:

                    VULCAN PROGRAM: EARTHSCAN
                    COMMAND.

                         GUS
                    Command! Awright!
                          (talking to the
                            computer)
                    This here's your new commander,
                    baby. Now listen good.
                            (starts to type

                                        CUT TO:

EXT. DEEP SPACE

FULL SHOT -- in outer space, the Vulcan Weather Satellite moves in orbit. 
Suddenly:

EFFECTS: two laser-like beams dart out from the satellite, their scarlet rays 
aimed at Earth.

CAMERA BEGINS TO PAN DOWN THE BEAMS TILL WE CAN SEE THE GLOBE OF EARTH TARGETED 
FAR AWAY.

EXT. SKY

EFFECTS: TIME-LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY -- Dark storm clouds begin amassing at a rapid 
rate. As they become a denser mass, they form the whirling cone of a tornado.
INT. WHEAT KING COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

                         GUS
                        (typing away busily now)
                    Yeah, okay, gimme the longitude
                    here...

VIDEO DISPLAY SCREEN reads:

                    LONGITUDE 98 DEGREES.

                         GUS
                    And the other thing...

VIDEO DISPLAY SCREEN reads:

                    LATTITUDE 175 DEGREES
                           (then)
                    LOCATION: COLUMBIA
                    SOUTH AMERICA.

INT. WHEAT KING COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

GUS is relieved and wildly excited.

                         GUS
                    Awright. Now...

He pushes some more buttons.

EXT. BORDER PATROL STATIONS. COLUMBIA - DAY

FULL SHOT -- a little border patrol shack. The sign above it, in Spanish, says 
"YOU ARE NOW ENTERING COLUMBIA. PASSPORT CONTROL."

Inside, we can SEE ONE GUARD at his desk. Outside, dozing in a chair tilted 
against the side of the shack, is a SECOND UNIFORMED GUARD.  IN B.G. we SEE the 
approaching tornado on the horizon.

CLOSE ON THE SECOND GUARD -- snoring away peacefully. Suddenly -- a drop of 
water hits his nose. Then another. Then a sprinkle begins to fall. He comes 
awake, startled. Looks up in surprise.

POV: LOOKING UP -- storm clouds everywhere. Suddenly a bolt of lightening.

                         GUARD
                         (leaping from 
                           his chair)
                    Caramba!

He runs into the shack. A moment later, torrential rain starts to fall.




IN A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

1. EXT. SKY -- bolts of lightening everywhere. Thunder booming.


2. EXT. FIELDS. COFFEE PLANTATION - DAY

LONG SHOT of the coffee fields whipped by the winds and becoming flooded by the 
rains. 

     CLOSER ON coffee plants -- lashed by the gale force winds, bending and 
breaking.
The furrows beneath them filling with water.

3. Trees nearby uprooted, falling across the fields.

4. EXT. FARM, COLUMBIA - DAY

A primitive irrigation system: a DONKEY tethered to a pole walks in a constant 
circle, causing a wooden paddle wheel to turn, scooping up water from a well and 
lifting it above ground to the fields where it cascades down the rows of plowed 
fields between rows of coffee plants. (PROCESS SHOWN IN QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS).

As the storm rises, the DONKEY panics, breaks free of the rope, and runs for 
cover as the rain starts.

5. EXT. LITTLE FARM HOUSE - DAY

A small mud-hut farm house on the edge of a coffee plantation. A PEASANT FAMILY 
clusters in the doorway, fearfully watching the incredible destruction outside.

CLOSER ON THEM -- the FATHER hugs his CHILD to his side. Behind them, inside the 
one-room hut we SEE the MOTHER kneeling and praying at a simple shrine with a 
little statue of the Virgin. The flame from the votary candles flickers and is 
blown out by the wind.

6. EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE, CLOMBIA - DAY

The sky is darkened here, but the rains have not yet reached the village. IN 
WIDE SHOT we SEE a little church with a steeple on one side of the square, and a 
café on the other side.

7. INT. CAFÉ, VILLAGE SQUARE, COLUMBIA - DAY

The OWNER and TWO WAITERS are busy decorating a wedding cake. IN B.G. we SEE the 
tables set for a party.








8. INT. CHURCH, VILLAGE SQUARE, COLUMBIA - DAY

In the church, a wedding is in progress. A small wedding party (BRIDE, GROOM, 
WITNESS, FAMILY, etc.) and the PRIEST.

REVERSE: In a back pew, taking pictures with an Instamatic and thrilled to be 
there watching an authentic South American wedding, are MR. AND MRS. MAURY 
STOKIS, the JINGO winners enjoying their trip. She dabs a sentimental tear; he 
snaps photos. Suddenly:

Sound: Thunder cracks. Fierce wind.

They look up fearfully from the ceremony as:

A stained glass window breaks and smashes to the floor.

MIDWAY DURING THE ABOVE SEQUENCES, WE BEGIN TO hear on sound track the voice of 
a TELEVISION NEWS COMMENTATOR. 

                         T.V. COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
                    Meteorologists are baffled by the 
                    tornado and torrential rain storms
                    that struck the South American
                    country of Colombia this afternoon,
                    threatening to destroy this nation's
                    entire coffee crop for the next five
                    years. The loss of the major export
                    would devastate  that already strife-
                    torn region's economy. Meanwhile, 
the tornado continues to pound with 
devastating force. Gale force winds up 
to an incredible 200 mph lash the
countryside, while 12 inches of 
rainfall heave already been recorded
in just one day.

At this point, we CONTINUE TO SEE IMAGES OF THE DESTRUCTION, BUT NOW THEY ARE 
IMAGES ON A TELEVISION SCREEN:


9. EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE, COLOMBIA - DAY

The rain and wind hit the square full force.

The church bell begins tolling out of control. blown by the wind. ANGLE UP ON
the steeple to SEE it careening, clanging.

10. SHOTS OF COFFEE PLANTATION -- row after row of coffee plants bent. Flood 
waters rising.

T.V. SCREEN: BEGIN TO PULL BACK REEALING THIS ON T.V. SCREEN as we SEE the T.V. 
NEWS COMMENTATOR seated at his desk, looking at CAMERA:


                    T.V. NEWS COMMENTATOR
               Flood warnings have given way to
               evacuation proceedings in the entire
               southern part of the country. A
               spokesman for the Department of
               Meteorology at Cal Tech here said
               this was, and I quote, "the most
               awesome display of natural forces
               unleashed since Noah's Ark." He 
               added that the storm's pattern seems
               to defy all known laws of weather
               systems to...

Right around here, we begin to hear maniacal laughter off-screen. CAMERA HAS 
PULLED BACK TO REVEAL the T. V. screen, but it is not yet clear WHERE WE ARE. 
The man laughing is ROSS WEBSTER and we hear him say:

                    ROSS (o.s.)
               Turn it off, turn it off! If I
               laugh any harder, I'll split
               my sides.

REVERSE. WE ARE IN:

EXT. PENTHOUSE. ROOFTOP "SKI RESORT" - DAY

(AT THIS POINT WE CAN'T TELL EXACTLY WHERE WEARE) ON ROSS, in snazzy ski togs, 
standing at the top of a ski slope. He pushes off and skis downhill. FOLLOW, at 
the bottom of the slope, reclining on a deck chair, wearing skin-tight ski-suit, 
holding a reflector to her face, to enhance her tan, is LORELEI. As ROSS comes 
to a stop, he sends a great spray of 'snow' all over LORELEI. She shrieks 
playfully.

                    LORELEI
               Ooooooh, I'll get you for that,
               you big silly!

ON VERA -- wincing with distaste at this baby-talk baloney, she sits nearby on a 
chair reading a book entitled: "A BEGINNER'S GUIDE TO COMPUTERS."

NEW ANGLE, LONG AND WIDE -- As VERA gets up to switch off the portable T.V. set 
at the bottom of the slope, we get our first real look at this extraordinary 
setting. A private "ski resort" has been constructed on the terrace of the 
Webster penthouse. While we SEE the skyline of Metropolis in B. G. and the 
CITIZENS OF METROPOLIS in summer clothing on the streets below, what ROSS has 
installed up here is a total winter environment. At the foot of the slope is the 
little Swiss chalet "set" for apres-ski; we glimpse a fireplace, a  bar, etc. in 
there.

                    VERA
                  (quivering voice)
               Bubba, do you realize what we're onto?




                    ROSS
                   (happily)
               Do I? Every time a drunk tries
               to sober up, he'll be drinking
               Webster coffee!

C.U. VERA -- eyes burning with a great idea.

                    VERA
                     (dramatically)
               Why stop at coffee!
                           (seeing the vision)
                    A cup of coffee gets the world
                    off to work in the morning,
                    but what keeps the world working?

                         LORELEI
                    Diet soda?
     
                         VERA
                    Energy! And when they say "Energy"
                    what do they mean? Nuclear? too
                    dangerous. Solar?? Too underdeveloped.

ON ROSS -- his eyes beginning to glow with fervor as he catches on.

                         ROSS
                    You mean...you mean...Vera!
                    Vera! The magnitude of this!!!

                         VERA
                          (proclaiming)
                    Today coffee----

                         ROSS
                    We already have Webster Petroleum

                         ROSS
                    We already have a super-tanker.

                           (brandishing her
                             computer manual) 
                    If Gus Gorman can push the 
                    right buttons ---

                         ROSS
                        (fired up, seeing
                          the vision)
                    I could have it all! Holy cats!
                    All the oil! All the tankers! All
                    the pumps! The gosh-darn world
                    will be out to lunch! No heat, no
                    gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!

At which point GUS enters, flipping a fancier yo-yo (the walnut executive 
model), looking very nervous and disturbed about something.

                         GUS
                    Hey, boss.

                         ROSS
                    Just the man I wanted to see!

                         GUS
                    Turn on the T.V.
               
                         ROSS
                    I did. isn't it neat-o?

                         GUS
                         (looks at ROSS
                           like he's nuts)
                    Uh...what channel were you
                    watching?

                         ROSS
                    What are you talking about, fella?

GUS walks over and turns on the T.V.

The T.V. NEWS COMMENTATOR'S face appears.









                         T.V. NEWS COMMENTATOR
                    ...and in an all-out effort, Superman
                    has been simply awesome. Awesome in 
his power. Awesome in his strength. 
Awesome in his ability to single-handedly
reverse this wave of terror and save little
Colombia from the brink of destruction.
One man -- a super man, to be sure --
is taking on the very force of Nature's fury
and, at this point, he seems to be winning!

(FIRST IMAGES OF SUPERMAN AT WORK APPEAR ON T.V. SCREEN, THEN GO TO NORMAL FILM 
FRAME)

A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

1. Battling through turbulence, with tremendous bolts of lightening around him, 
SUPERMAN flies through the Colombian sky.

2. EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE, COLOMBIA - DAY

The little church, buffeted by the storm, is starting to collapse. The mud-
stucco facade cracks, begins to sag and crumble.

Just as the façade starts to go, MR. AND MRS. MAURY STOKIS come barreling out of 
the church, hell-for-leather. He turns and tries to take one last snapshot of 
the spectacle.

                         MRS. STOKIS
                    Maury! Forget the pictures!

The wall falls on top of them and they're lost from sight.

Moments later, the WEDDING PARTY, running for their lives, comes pouring out of 
the church. Buffeted by the gale-force winds, soaked to the skin, they try to 
cross the square to the relative safety of the café across the way.

ANGLE UP -- a tremendous gust of wind looses the bell from its moorings in the 
steeple. The tremendous iron bell goes flying across the square, heading right 
for the fleeing BRIDE and GROOM.

SUPERMAN zooms in and just in time catches the bell in his arms before it gets 
to the people.

EFFECTS: The vibrations of the bell cause SUPERMAN to vibrate at a rapid rate. 
Accompanied by...sound: incessant clanging of the bell.

3. EXT. COFFEE PLANTATION, FILEDS - DAY

LONG SHOT -- the fields flooding with water in the furrowed rows between the 
coffee plants. SUPERMAN lands at the end of the field an:

EFFECTS: Rays of Heat-Vision dart from his eyes and sweep across the field. The 
result is astonishing: he has dried up all the water.

4. ON THE WATER WHEEL -- SUPERMAN grabs the strut that was attached to the 
donkey and begins running at Super-Speed in the opposite (counter-clockwise) 
direction.

IN A SERIES OF SHOTS, WE SEE THE EFFECT REVERSED: The water in the affected 
furrows is drawn back into the paddle wheel and deposited in the underground 
well.

5. OMITTED

6. EXT. SKY

SUPERMAN flies up into the heart of the storm and begins to blow the clouds.

EFFECTS: Super-Breath (time lapse photography) blows the terrible dark clouds 
away, pushing the storm up into the stratosphere where it can do no more harm.

7. EXT. SKY AND SPACE

Now SUPERMAN begins to fly straight up, heading for space. FOLLOW as he passes 
through the clouds.

8. EXT. COFFEE FIELDS - DAY

LONG SHOT -- the storm is over. The sun comes out. The sky is blue. Birds chirp.

EFFECTS (TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY): Coffee beans ripen from green to rich red.

ON THE PENTHOUSE. ROOFTOP "SKI RESORT" - DAY

Enraged at what he has just seen on the screen, ROSS lets out a shriek.

                         ROSS
                        No! No! No!

In his fury he pounds the arms of his folding chair so hard that it folds up 
with him in it.

                         ROSS
                        (thrashing around,
                          enraged)
                    It was perfect! It was the
                    perfect plan! It was foolproof.

As she beats LORELEI in a footrace to see which one will reach ROD+SS first to 
help him out of his folding chair, PAN TO GUS. Looking miserable and out-of-it, 
he is talking to himself (nobody else is paying attention to him) as he wanders 
over to a pair of skis with boots attached laying nearby.

                         GUS
                        (aloud, but to
                          himself)
                    Just a matter of time 'til they
                    start blamin' me. that's always
                    what happens.
He slips his feet into the ski boots, curious to try them. FOLLOW HIM as he 
starts to walk clumsily up the slope, trying to master his balance in this odd 
footwear.

                         GUS
                    Ain't my fault, I done what I was
                    supposed to do.
                           (climbing up 
         awkwardly)
                    Everybody blames it on me when
                    they start lookin' to get it off
                    themselves. Some kid in the 
                    classroom blows a spit-ball, 
                    who gets sent to the principle's 
                    office? Gus Gorman.

He continues up the slope, feet splayed wide apart, slipping and sliding, he is 
petulant, self-pitying.

                         ROSS
                    He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder,
                    he ruined it.

                         VERA
                    Don't cry, Bubba.

ROSS stomps off into the snow, feeling sorry for himself.

FAVORING LORELEI --annoyed at VERA'S ass-kissing, she stands up holding a 
steaming mug of mulled wine that has been sitting on the table beside her. She 
dips the cheese-cloth bag of spices...like an outsized tea-bag...that has been 
seeping in the cup, then takes it out. Carrying it by its string (it is dripping 
boiling hot wine and waves of steam are rising from it), she stoops beside VERA 
and seems about to drop the hot bag in VERA'S wastebasket. Instead, she drops it 
on the unsuspecting VERA'S outstretched hand.

Which brings VERA leaping and screaming to her feet, her burned hand flying into 
the air.

                         VERA
                    AIEEEE!

ROSS spins around, to see VERA in this agitated position.

                         LORELEI
                           (quickly)
                    Vera's practicing her karate.

Trying to put a good front on it, VERA has no choice but to continue with a 
series of cries and arm chops. But she uses the last two to give LORELEI a 
genuine karate  blow in the gut. LORELEI doubles over. VERA, pretending it is 
just the usual bowing ritual at the end of a karate exhibition, also bows.






                         ROSS
                    Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't

                    You'll see! Now that he's pulled
                    this stunt, he'll stick his nose in
                    my oil scheme and ruin that one,
                    too! I've got to get rid of him!
                    I've got to!

                         VERA
                    How? Shoot him? You know about
                    him and bullets. Not to mention
                    knives, tanks, bombs...

ON GUS -- Laboriously trying to get to the top of the slopes, still muttering 
his monologue.

                    broke in, who gets hauled into

                         ROSS
                    Wait a minute! She's right!
                    Kryptonite. I remember reading
                    about it in an interview with him.

                    What's wrong?

                         ROSS
                    I just remembered the rest. There
                    isn't any more. The only chunk 
                    that ever landed on Earth disappeared
                    a couple of years ago. It was in this
                    story in the Daily Planet.

                         VERA
                    Where did it come from?

ROSS
The planet Superman came from.
                    Krypton.

ON GUS -- at the top of the slope.

                         GUS
                    It ain't. It's nowhere. It blew up.
                    That's how come they shipped the
                    dude to Earth when he was a baby.
                          (pause, as they all
                            look oddly at GUS)
                    well. I know some stuff too, y'all.

ROSS
Wait a second. Astronomers know
where the planet used to be, right?
And you know what happens when
a planet explodes? Debris. Pieces
floating in space.

     VERA
So?

     ROSS
So all we've got to do is pick up the
garbage.
       (warming to it)
We just have to find our where in 
Heaven Krypton used to be. Then
good old Gus here contacts the
Vulcan satellite--

ANGLE UP ON GUS - at the top of the ski slope, asserting himself.

                         GUS
                    Just hold on a minute. I have been
                    doin' some thinkin'

                         ROSS
                    God, that's what I keep you for.

                         GUS
                    That's what I been thinkin' about.
                    How you been keepin' me.
                           (pause: nervously
                             but bravely)
                    I ain't getting' nothing outta this
                    gig.

ROSS
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's
greed.

     GUS
       (outraged)
Greed!
        (extremely agitated)
Let me tell you something---

In his burst of anger, he loses his equilibrium and suddenly starts to plummet 
down the ski slope.
               
EXT. WEBSTER PENTHOUSE, BUILDING - DAY

LONG SHOT -- GUS goes zooming down the slope at great speed. With no poles and 
no knowledge of how to stop, he keeps going right off the roof, sailing out into 
the air. At the end of his trajectory, gravity takes over. He falls straight 
down )CAMERA PANS DOWN TO WATCH) ten stories and lands on an awning above the 
doorway of the apartment building. This, in turn, functions as a min-slope, and 
he skis right off it and lands in the middle of the street.

ON HE STREET: Cars brake to a halt; PEDESTRIANS are startled to see a man on 
skis suddenly landing in their midst. GUS, once he's realized he's all right, 
tries to carry it off as if he knew what he was doing all along. He saunters off 
down the road with a forced display of cool, if you can call a guy on skis 
clomping down a city street "sauntering."

AS WE WATCH GUS clomp away, ROSS'S DIALOGUE CONTINUES AS A VOICE-OVER as we SEE:

EXT. DEEP SPACE

As he described it, chunks of glowing green Kryptonite drifting in space. 

INT. WEBCO DATA PROCESSING CENTER - DAY

As we SEE GUS back at his old, original spot, muttering to himself as he rolls 
up his sleeve and begins to play the computer like a wurlitzer, ROSS'S voice-
over continues:


                         ROSS (v.o.)
                    Once Gus contacts the Vulcan
                    satellite, he orders it to search
                    through outer space around 
                    where Krypton went bye-bye.

During the above speech, GUS'S coordinates appear ON THE COMPUTER DISPLAY 
SCREEN:
          
          LOCATE AND SEARCH X GALAXY AT 3500 LIGHT YEARS.

A beat. Then, as he punches more buttons, another message appears ON COMPUTER 
DISPLAY SCREEN below the first:

          ANALYZE COMPONENT ELEMENTS OF KRYPTONITE PARTICLES.

Another beat. THE DISPLAY SCREEN GOES BLANK. GUS waits, and then an answer 
appears ON THE DISPLAY SCREEN:

EFFECTS: BLIPS ON DISPLAY SCREEN:

          SCANNING . . . 

The satellite shoots a beam out and up. FOLLOW THE BEAM through the deep blue, 
still faintly sunlit atmosphere and up into the eternal night of deep space.

EXT. DEEP SPACE - NIGHT

The searching satellite beam discovers glowing green particles of Kryptonite 
drifting in this very distant darkness. As it plays over them like a flashlight: 
ROSS"S VOICE-OVER DIALOGUE CONTINUES:

                         ROSS (v.o.)
                    Then the laser probe simply
                    locks onto a floating chunk of
                    Kryptonite, the computer                    
                    analyzes the components and
                    the boys in the lab duplicate
                    the stuff down here.


INT. WEBCO DATA PROCESSING CENTER - DAY

As we hear various humming, clicking, and whirring noises:

ON THE BLANK COMPUTER DISPLAY SCREEN ... it begins to show a message:

C.U. GUS -- watching gleefully.

                    GUS
               Uh-huh! Uh-huh!

ON COMPUTER DISPLAY SCREEN -- the computer has added to the list:

          DIALUM       . . .  10.62%
          MERCURY    . . .   4.08%

Sound: the whirring and clicking stop.

GUS smiles broadly as he reaches to tear off the printout sheet. He's done it! 
But suddenly:

Sound: the whirring and clicking begin again.

The printout sheet emerges a little further as an addition to the list appears 
ON THE COMPUTER DISPLAY SCREEN:

          UNKNOWN    . . .  0.57%

He ponders a moment. looks down. Sees something.

INSERT: A pack of his cigarettes on the table beside him. It's one  of the low-
tar brands and we SEE the listing on the package: NICOTINE 8%, TAR 5%.

CLOSE ON   GUS -- He takes an electronic eraser (a pencil-like gadget, attached 
by wires to the machine) and carefully rubs it across the line on the video 
display screen just where the word "UNKNOWN" appears. then he types in a new 
word:

          TAR            . . .    0.57%
          
                         GUS
                    He ain't gonna smoke this stuff,
                    so what the hell...

He carefully tears the printout sheet. WIDEN SHOT as he leaves the DATA 
PROCESSING CENTER and heads down the corridor. FOLLOW HIM UNTIL:

INT. WEBCO, MAIN OFFICES. CORRIDOR - DAY

GUS stops at a door marked:

               WEBCO -- RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

After a beat, the door is opened very slightly by a WHITE-COATED SCIENTIST.


                         GUS
                        (giving him a bright
                          smile and the altered
                            printout sheet)
                    The Boss says he wants this to go.

INT. DAILY PLANET, CITY ROOM - DAY

Looking absolutely furious, MR. STOKIS is making his way with considerable 
difficulty past the desks of REPORTERS, heading for PERRY'S office. The 
considerable difficulty is due to the fact that (a) he has one leg in a plaster 
cast that goes up to his hip, (b) he walks with a crutch to help him, (c) he has 
one arm in a sling and (d) with his other arm he is propelling before him a 
wheelchair containing MRS. STOKIS, who has both legs in a plaster cast as well 
as a neck brace. Following them, trying to stop them, is a desperate MISS 
HENDERSON.

                         MR. STOKIS
                    Where is he? He'll pay for this!
                          (screaming)
                    Get your wallet out, Mr. Editor!

                         MISS HENDERSON
                           (trying to stop him)
                    Please, Mr. Stokis, it isn't Mr.

AS THEY CONTINUE OUT OF FRAME TOWARD PERRY WHITE'S OFFICE IN B.G. HOLD ON CLARK

on his reunion story.

                    Well, that autograph you got him
                    from Superman -- he got really
                    carried away after that and told
                    the other kids that Superman's
                    his pal. And he said Superman's
                    even coming to visit him for his 
                    birthday next Wednesday.
                          (catching a breath)
                    Okay, it was wrong. But when

                    No, well in this case I think
                    I can speak for him.

                    home-cooked meal he's had in...

INT. DAILY PLANET, CLARK KENT'S DESK - DAY

ON CLARK -- hanging up slowly. No one ever said that to him before.

Behind him, and for some time now, a considerable commotion has been going on in 
PERRY'S office. CAMERA NOW ZOOMS PAST CLARK TO SEE PERRY and MR. STOKIS in a 
screaming match, while a distraught MISS HENDERSON wrings her hands and an 
immobile MRS. STOKIS just sits in her wheelchair.

                         MR. STOKIS
                    Bad luck??!! I'll give you
                    bad luck!!! I'm suing you!

                         PERRY
                    It wasn't our fault. It was an
                    act of God!

                    In a church????!!

INT. WEBCO INDUSTRIES MAIN OFFICES. SMALL EMPTY OFFICE - DAY

ON GUS-- waiting in a little room practicing his yo-yo. By now he's finally 
mastered up-and-down and is into (badly) some tricks like "walking the dog." He 
makes a few tries and almost jumps when a finger taps his shoulder sharply from 
behind.

WIDEN TO TWO SHOT -- the white-clad SCIENTIST to whom GUS gave the formula is 
holding a laboratory tray with a glowing green chunk of Kryptonite on it. He 
sets the tray on the desk in front of GUS.

                         SCIENTIST
                         (very superior)
                    Here you are. I can't imagine
                    what you want with it, but you've
                    got it.

He leaves. GUS eyes the Kryptonite warily, finally forces himself to reach for 
it, and picks it up so gingerly that he almost drops it. Which redoubles his 
terror...until he suddenly realizes.

                         GUS
                    Hey, what'm I scared of?
                    I'm an Earthling.

EXT. SMALLVILLE MAIN STREET. WOODED PLATFORM - DAY

C.U. RICKY -- dressed in his Sunday best and bursting with pride.



PULL BACK TO THREE SHOT -- RICKY couldn't be happier, with his MOTHER on one 
side and SUPERMAN on the other. They are all seated on rather narrow, rickety 
folding chairs, smiling out at US.

                         SUPERMAN
                          (to LANA, vaguely
                           embarrassed)
                    You know, I really wasn't
                    expecting all this.

                         LANA
                    Well...I guess they did get
                    a little carried away.

CONTINUE PULLBACK TO WIDE SHOT TO REVEAL how Smallville gets "carried away." A 
wooden platform, the type they put up for 4th of July speeches and ceremonies, 
has been erected in the middle of Main Street. Seated there, in addition to 
SUPERMAN, LANA, and RICKY, are LOCAL DIGNITARIES looking pleased as punch.

The MAYOR is clearing his throat at a microphone. A table has been set up beside 
him and on it are some gifts for SUPERMAN. A banner, stretched across MAIN 
STREET, reads "SMALLVILLE WELCOMES SUPERMAN." Crowded around the platform are 
TOWNSPEOPLE, young and old. A few yards away the HIGH SCHOOL MARCHING BAND, 
brass buttons gleaming, awaits their cue.

                         MAYOR
                    Superman, we all know you're not
                    looking for honors and awards.
                    But when we heard that you were
                    coming to see your pal Ricky...

C.U. RICKY -- grinning so wide it almost splits his cheeks.

                         MAYOR
                    ...we realized this was our chance
                    to say thank you. First, for putting
                    out a forest fire that could have
                    ruined miles of timberland. Second,
                    for averting a terrible tragedy at the 
                    Iroquois Trail Nuclear power Plant.
                    And not least, for saving little Ricky.
                    So, since you already have won the 
                    key to our hearts, Superman, may I
                    present you with...
                          (picks up a presentation
                            box from table, opens
                            it, takes out a big gold-
                            plated key)
                    ...the key to the city.

SUPERMAN rises, gratefully accepts it, holds it for the crowd to see, then puts 
it down on the table. Applause.

PEOPLE with Instamatics and Polaroids snapping away.

                         MAYOR
                    Not to be outdone by the
                    office of the Mayor, the 
                    Ladies' Auxiliary would
                    like you to have...
                         (he hands him a spiral-
                           bound thin volume)
                    ...The Smallville Cookbook.

SUPERMAN takes it, graciously declines the offer of the microphone, and smiles 
at a gaggle of LADIES in the front row.

ON THE LADIES -- smiling back, thrilled, like senior groupies.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Thank you, ladies. I'm sure this
                    will come in handy.

Suddenly, a burst of music comes blasting out nearby and coming closer: stirring 
military martial air like "The Caissons Go Rolling Along," blaring through loud-
speakers.

All heads turn, startled to see:

ANGLE DOWN THE MAIN STREET -- Coming toward the reviewing stand is a khaki-
colored car (or jeep), the words U.S. ARMY stenciled on the door. One of those 
loudspeakers of the type used by cars traveling around town advertising 
elections or concerts is mounted on the roof and is the source of the march 
music. As the car gets CLOSER TO F. G. WE SEE that the driver, in WAC uniform is 
VERA. Seated in the back seat, wearing the uniform of a 5-Star General with all 
the accouterments we associate with General Patton (white "dress" helmet, ascot 
foulard, jodhpurs, swagger stick in hand) is GUS.

NEW ANGLE -- the car comes to a screeching halt by the reviewing stand. 
Considerable curiosity from the crowd as VERA, in crisp no-nonsense manner, 
steps out and commands:

                         VERA
                    Ten-hut!

The CROWD, conditioned by years of watching war movies, instantly and 
unquestioningly, rises to attention.

Upright in posture, authoritative in manner, slapping his swagger stick against 
his side, GUS surveys the crowd with an air of critical skepticism, then mounts 
the platform.

ON SUPERMAN -- A bit curious himself at all this. Beside him the MAYOR is 
standing stiffly at attention as if his spine would snap.

GROUP SHOT -- Total silence. GUS strides across the platform as if surveying his 
troops, scowls a bit. Then does what he thinks is a gesture of authority and 
command: he slaps the side of his leg with his swagger stick. He does it too 
hard, though, and it hurts. A fleeting look of pain, which he tries to conceal. 
Then, to the podium:





                         GUS
                        (using a Patton-like
                          voice and delivery)
                    Listen up! I've come here direct
                    from the Pentagon so you better
                    believe there's a damn good reason!
                    I'm here to tell you that God has
                    given us the greatest goddamn gift
                    in the world: nuclear power! But
                    if we don't protect it, it's our ass!
                    And democracy's ass! And the
                    free world's ass!

The OLD LADIES look a bit shocked; the MEN in the crowd nod with patriotic 
fervor.

                         GUS
                    You people want to be able to
                    go to church on Sunday and sit
                    in the Super Bowl, don't you?
                         (he pounds his swagger
                          stick on the podium
                          for emphasis; it breaks)
                    But what about the peacetime uses
                    of nuclear power? You all want some
                    Ay-rabs in white robes tellin' you
                    you got to pay through the nose for
                    their Cadillac limousines so you can
                    get enough juice to light up your
                    Christmas tree??! Not to mention
                    the nice clean air so the great
                    American bald eagle can fly
                    without coughin' himself to death!

ON SUPERMAN -- listening, thinking about it.

                         GUS
                    Now last week half this great
                    nation almost bit the bullet, nuclear- 
                    power-wise. Wasn't anything the 
military      could do about it -- we 
were busy protecting our borders
at the time it happened. So I say, 
thank the good lord above for
Superman!

Applause. SUPERMAN looks humble, a bit chagrined.

                         GUS
                    Just when it looked like curtains--
                    and I don't mean just the Iron 
                    Curtain, I mean all the curtains! --
                    Along came this great American!
                          (points to SUPERMAN)
                    Superman, you saved our bacon.
                    We want to show our gratitude.
GUS snaps his fingers imperiously at VERA, who stands below the platform.

ON VERA -- snarling at having to play this subservient role, she mounts the 
platform, carrying a wooden presentation box about a foot high. She hands it to 
GUS.

                         GUS
                    I want to present you with this
                    token of appreciation for what
                    did to stop the disaster at Iroquois
                    Trail. It's your government's way
                    of saying, "Hey buddy, you done
                    real good."

He opens it. There, glowing and gleaming against the velvet background, is a 
small statue in the shape of the nuclear plant cooling tower we saw earlier. We 
recognize its green glow immediately as the Kryptonite we saw before.

ON SUPERMAN -- as he lifts it out and holds it aloft, we hear the CROWD oohing 
and aahing. but as he takes the statue out and studies it:

EFFECTS: INSERT--the gleam suddenly dies. in his hand, the statue goes dull and 
then darkens to a sinister, poisonous greenish-black.

ON SUPERMAN -- A little uncertain but otherwise unchanged. he eyes the ugly, 
burnt-out shape and summons all his good will to say:

                         SUPERMAN
                    Thanks. General. It's...swell.

TIGHT C.U. GUS -- his eyes flicker and blink in momentary panic as he realizes 
SUPERMAN isn't dropping dead.

                         GUS
                         (quickly, losing his
                           cool, sounding less
                           Patton-like now)
                    Well...uh...I ain't got no time
                    to stick around for the corn-on-
                    the-cob and square dancing or
                    whatever it is you people do. We
                    got to get back to the base for...
                    uh...well, I can't tell you what
                    for, it's top secret.

Quickly he descends, VERA behind him, and looking a bit shook up, gets in the 
car. VERA, just before she gets behind the wheel, turns to the CROWD.

                         VERA
                    At ease! Siddown!

The car drives away. The CROWD clusters around SUPERMAN.




EXT. STREET IN SMALLVILLE - TWILIGHT

ON GUS -- walking disconsolately on a deserted street in Smallville, muttering 
to himself, kicking at a tin can.

                         GUS
                    "Unknown," how was I supposed
                    to know what 'unknown' is...

Ahead of him, on the corner is a pay phone. He enters it, sighs heavily with the 
burden on his mind, drops in a bunch of coins and dials.

                         GUS
                    Hello, Boss? ...You know how
                    people's always tryin' to copy
                    that secret recipe for that fried 
                    chicken they sell in them buckets,
                    but nobody can figure out the
                    secret ingredient?

INT. ROSS WEBSTER'S OFFICE - TWILIGHT

C.U. ROSS -- on the phone as his desk. He is livid, furious.

                         ROSS
                    He didn't die???? I ask you to
                    kill Superman and you're telling
                    me you couldn't even do that one
                    simple thing??!!!

EXT. LANA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

The car parked in the drive, lights on in the house.

INT. LANA'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - TWILIGHT

SUPERMAN is relaxing after an early supper, sitting on the sofa and leafing 
through a photo album. PAN TO SEE LANA as she tiptoes out of RICKY'S room.

                         LANA
                    He was asleep before his head
                    hit the pillow.
                         (smiling)
                    Well, this was only the biggest
                    day of his life. I really don't
                    know how to thank you.

                         SUPERMAN
                    You just did, with that great
                    dinner.





                         LANA
                        (almost blushing)
                    Oh well, I do like to cook.
                    You'll take some coffee, 
                    won't you?
                         (quickly)
                    Decaffeinated, of course.

And she disappears into the kitchen.

Sound: A telephone rings in the kitchen. We hear LANA murmuring faintly, 
occasionally, as:

ON SUPERMAN -- he sits up, frowning. He presses his eyes and shakes his head as 
if to clear it, as if he suddenly had a headache or got dizzy. But these moves 
don't seem to help much. He just sinks back into the sofa, looking as if he 
really isn't feeling like himself.

LANA hurries back in, very upset.

                         LANA
                        (almost in on breath)
                    Superman, I'm sorry. I really hate
                    to cut this evening short, but... my
                    friend Betty just called! There's
                    been an accident on the old River 
Bridge. A tank truck filled with acid
turned over! It's leaking acid and
they're afraid the bridge is collapsing!
     (as if she were imposing)
I am sorry. I hate to make you rush off!

But SUPERMAN doesn't move. He just sits there, eyeing her very deliberately.

                         SUPERMAN
                         (quietly)
                    There's no rush.

                         LANA
                          (surprised)
                    But the bridge...

                         SUPERMAN
                    Hey, Don't I always get there in
                    time?
                         (as LANA nods uncertainly
       he smiles and pats the sofa)
                    Come on, relax.

TIGHTER TWO SHOT -- as she sits down beside him, he casually moves closer and 
smoothly slips an arm behind her, almost touching her.
     
                         SUPERMAN
                    It's hard to believe...
                    a great looking girl like
                    you all alone like this.
As she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, 
then...finally...just realistic:

                         LANA
                    Listen, are you sure you shouldn't
                    do something about the bridge?

ON SUPERMAN

                         SUPERMAN
                           (vaguely)
                    The bridge...?
                           (suddenly, as if coming
                             out of a trance)
                    I'd better get going!

And he rushes out. HOLD ON LANA, looking after him, still troubled.

EXT. RIVER BRIDGE, SMALLVILLE - TWILIGHT

Just as LANA said, a big tank truck has turned over on its side. DANGER--ACID is 
painted on the tank, which has indeed sprung a considerable leak from a crack in 
the side. Acid is trickling out with accompanying hissing steam and bubbling 
corrosion effects. AN EMERGENCY CREW is doing its best, trying to spray water 
from a hose to keep the acid from eating away the pilings. BUT:

CLOSER -- the acid drips onto the support system of the bridge and is eating the 
old metal away right before our eyes.

LONGER -- the bridge starts to sway dangerously and the pilings begin to buckle. 
POLICE CARS, FIRETRUCKS there. Ropes have been attached to the bridge structure, 
and GUYS are holding fast on shore.

ON THE GUYS -- many of them hold wet cloths over their faces to protect them 
from the terrible acid fumes. Smoke curls back in their faces as they valiantly 
try to stem the inevitable.

                         FIRST GUY
                    It won't hold! It's going!

                         A SHERIFF
                        (into a bullhorn)
                    Clear the area! Clear the area!

Sound: A deep rumbling as the bridge starts to go.

                         EMERGENCY CREW CHIEF
                    Get down!

ON THE BRIDGE -- it sways precipitously, then the pilings crack and crumble and 
the bridge collapses, taking the tanker with it.

ON THE WATCHERS -- aghast at the destruction.

PAN UP TO THE SKY -- flying over the horizon, coming toward the area, is 
SUPERMAN.
NEW ANGLE -- he lands on the river bank. although we can't as yet quite be 
certain, especially in this half-light, it seems that the colors of his costume 
have darkened almost imperceptibly, the blue just a shade deeper, the red a bit 
darker, His hair seems a little out of place, but then, that might be from the 
wind...

                         SUPERMAN
                         (as he lands)
                    What...
                          (looks at where the
                            bridge used to be)
                    What can I do to help?

ON THE EMERGENCY CEW AND POLICE -- they look at him, disappointed and, frankly, 
a bit surprised.

                         SHERIFF
                    Not much of anything now.

                         EMERGENCY CREW CHIEF
                    If only you'd got here a few
                    minutes ago.

ON SUPERMAN -- he looks away from their eyes. He seems troubled, puzzled. How 
could this have happened?

EXT. STREET - PISA, ITALY - DAY

ON THE CORRUGATED AWNING OF A SOUVENIR STAND as two hands roll it up. As the 
interior is revealed, we SEE the contents of the shelves: rows and rows of cheap 
plastic souvenir Leaning Towers of Pisa, all leaning identically; rows and rows  
of picture postcards with the same identical view.  PULL BACK and WIDEN to 
reveal an ITALIAN SHOPKEEPER admiring his stock as he gets ready for the day's 
tourists. CONTINUE TO  WIDEN: NOW WE SEE in the distant B.G. is the real Leaning 
Tower of Pisa, tilted at the same familiar angle as all those plastic replicas. 
As the MAN hums happily, ZOOM PAST HIM to the real tower, THEN CONTINUE TO ZOOM 
PAST THE TOWER TO AN  APPROACHING BLUE DOT IN THE SKY.

EXT. SKY ABOVE PISA - DAY

SUPERMAN is coming this way, and now there can be no mistaking it: his outfit is 
changing color, becoming a little darker in its hues. And there's a slightly 
different cast to his features, maybe a bit drawn, as if he'd had a hard night. 
But he doesn't really look that different...except for a funny glint in his eye.

EFFECTS: A quick flash, almost subliminal (a few FRAMES at most) of the honest, 
clean-cut face of CLARK KENT appears behind SUPERMAN'S altered features, then 
disappears.

As he looks down, a slow, mischievous smile starts to form on his face.

HIS POV: The Leaning Tower of Pisa ahead.

ON SUPERMAN, FLYING -- he chuckles to himself as the idea comes to him. Then he 
abruptly changes course and starts a rapid descent. 

NEW ANGLE, WIDE, FULL SHOT -- Approaching the top of the Leaning Tower, SUPERMAN 
extends his arms and, bracing himself in midair, starts to push the Tower 
upright. He continues, quietly chuckling as he does so.

EXT. SOUVENIR STAND, PISA - DAY

As in the OPENIG SHOT: the shelves of the stand RIGHT, the OWNER standing there  
dusting them, the real Leaning Tower in B.G. But now, as he stops dusting to 
make an   automatic look at the source of his success, a remarkable thing is 
happening, slowly, inch by inch, SUPERMAN pushes it into an upright position.  
The Leaning Tower of Pisa isn't leaning anymore; it's just another Tower. 

The Italian entrepreneur looks, goes back to his work, then does an incredible 
double-take.

                         SOUVENIR SELLER
                    Mamma Mia!

HE clutches his heart melodramatically.

POV: SUPERMAN flies overhead, the deed done. He seems to be grinning 
mischievously.

ON THE SOUVENIR SELLER -- hysterical, smashing his wares off the shelf, making 
vile and obscene gestures at the retracting figure of SUPERMAN:
     
                         SOUVENIR SELLER
                    Super-Cretino! Stronzo!...
MONTAGE: NEWSPAPERS

The classic MONTAGE of spinning newspapers that comes to a stop so that we can 
read the headlines. The effect is to show how SUPERMAN'S strange behavior is 
creating a scandal all over the world. Thus:

A FRENCH newspaper headline reads: LE SCANDAL DE SUPERMAN.

Then a JAPANESE one, showing the Leaning (straightened) Tower of Pisa. And so 
on.

Then, spinning out of limbo, the cover of TIME MAGAZINE. It shows a portrait of 
SUPERMAN, but in place of usual "S" on his chest, there is a question mark ("?). 
The banner line on the cover reads :

SUPERMAN: GOODNESS AT THE CROSSROADS

INT. ROSS WEBSTER'S OFFICE - DAY

ROSS and LORELEI are using the gym equipment in the office and are appropriately 
attired; he in a sweat suit, she in mind-boggling spandex leotard. He's running 
in place on a treadmill with a pedometer attached; she's leaning forward at a 
sharp angle, pulling on ropes attached to  counter-weights behind her that are 
stacked on a Nautilus machine. VERA sits at the desk in her usual Ninotchka 
suit, reading aloud from the TIME magazine just SEEN.

                         VERA
                    "At a special session of the 
                    General Assembly, 178 countries
                    voted to censure Superman. With 
                    only Columbia abstaining."
                         ROSS
                    That fella's becoming a public
                    menace.

                         LORELEI
                         (bending, pulling)
                    And he use to be such a 
                    sweetie pie! What's wrong
                    with him the last two weeks?
                    
VERA "casually" extends her foot and kicks the toggle bolt that holds the 
weights in place. LORELEI, leaning forward with suddenly no tension on the 
ropes, she pulls, falls forward flat on her face. ROSS turns to see what 
happened. instantly, VERA begins counting:

                         VERA
                    Time for you push-ups. 1 and
                    2 and 3 and 4 and 1 and 2 and ...

LORELEI, smiling gamely, immediately starts doing push-ups.

                         ROSS
                           (beaming)
                    That's what I like to see. My
                    two best gals pulling together.

NEW ANGLE -- revealing GUS GORMAN sitting in a corner of the room. He is 
sketching something on the back of an envelope, which he puts back in his pocket 
as he says:

                         GUS
                    He sure wasn't actin' bad and
                    nasty that day in Smallville. Man,
                    he was so full of niceness I was
                    startin' to feel funny about layin'
                    that chunk of...

ON ROSS

                         ROSS
                         (suddenly)
                    KRYPTONITE!

                         GUS
                    Huh?

ROSS, with an expression of "Eureka!" hops off the running treadmill, his body 
momentum, however, keeps him running in place. And...

TWO SHOT, FULL LENGTH -- without even thinking about it, GUS automatically 
starts running in place beside him, as they talk, to "keep up with him" and be 
polite.






                         ROSS
                    Don't you see? Okay, so you
                    didn't kill him. Nobody's
                    perfect. But that stuff we ran
                    up in the lab wasn't a complete
                    failure after all.
                        (explaining)
                    Right after Gus gave it to him,
                    Superman started to turn into
                    a selfish, ornery, malicious,
                    conniving...

                         VERA
                          (summing it up)
                    A normal person.

                         ROSS
                    And now that Superman's out of
                    the Nice Guy business...

                         VERA
                    We can get to work on that oil!

EXT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT (STOCK FOOTAGE): A great stadium with banners announcing the 
Olympic Games.

EXT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - DAY

INSIDE THE STADIUM (STOCK FOOTAGE): The stands filled with PEOPLE. The field 
filled with TEAMS FROM EVERY COUNTRY holding their flags, wearing outfits. It is 
the opening ceremonies.

ON THE TOWER AT THE FAR END OF THE STADIUM, with the long pyramid of steps 
leading up to the as-yet-unlit Olympic Flame. We recognize immediately this 
often-seen ceremony.

IN LONG SHOT -- A RUNNER, the MAN picked to light the Olympic Flame, which will 
burn throughout the Games and which signals the opening, runs up the long flight 
of steps carrying in his had the Olympic Torch that has been passed from runner 
to runner on it's journey toward this ultimate moment. As we WATCH this ceremony 
reaching its stirring conclusion, we hear the voice of an announcer on T.V. or 
radio:

                         ANNOUNCER (v.o.)
                    And now, the supreme moment as the
                    last runner...the one given the great
                    honor of lighting the Olympic
                    Flame...runs the last leg of a marathon
                    that began 7 days ago as this torch
                    has been passed from athlete to 
                    athlete for 970 miles across the 
                    country.               

As the RUNNER ascends to the top step and raises the torch high to light the 
giant dish where the Flame will burn:

REVERSE: ZOOM TO SUPERMAN -- standing on the floodlight tower on the opposite 
side of the stadium, on top of the wall. His costume is definitely darker now, 
the blue becoming Prussian blue, the red deepening to a maroon. His hair is 
uncombed, and his features look darker, tougher, as if he hadn't shaved for a 
few days. With a look of pure malevolence, he:

EFFECTS: blows a gust of Super-Breath.

ON THE RUNNER -- the breath blows out the Olympic Flame.

Sound: a gasp from the CROWD.

And the RUNNER, terribly confused and upset, has to turn and run down the great 
stairs, still carrying the Torch, to go get it re-lit somewhere.

INT. ROSS WEBSTER'S OFFICE - DAY

LORELEI is all alone in the office, seated at a table, deeply immersed in a 
book.

CLOSER ON HER: The book she's reading with such interest is Immanuel Kant's 
Critique of Pure Reason.

                         LORELEI
                        (aloud, puzzled)
                    How can he say that pure
                    categories have no objective 
                    meaning in transcendental 
                    logic? What about synthetic
                    unity?

Suddenly, as she hears the door opening, she hides her book behind a Movie 
Gossip magazine and immediately assumes her persona of empty-headed sex-pot.

WIDE SHOT -- as ROSS, VERA, and GUS enter.

                         LORELEI
                    Hi, honey, am I in your way?

                         ROSS
                         (in fine fettle)
                    No, stick around, you might
                    learn something.

ROSS presses a button. Suddenly the walls of the office flip over and become 
enormous mural-sized illuminated maps with electronic blips. The entire room is, 
in other words, rapidly transformed into a "War Room" a la Dr. Strangelove.

CAMERA ON A WALL-SIZED MAP OF THE WORLD, showing all the oceans of the world. 
Illuminated green miniature images of oil tankers are scattered on all the 
bodies of water.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL ROSS, a pointer in one hand, a remote control device in the 
other, as he points to the map.

                         ROSS
                    Every oil tanker and super-
                    tanker and super-duper-tanker
                    in the ocean is controlled. 
                    totally, by computers. Computers
                    to tell them where to go, how 
                    much oil to take on, where to
                    deliver it.

                         GUS
                    They ain't got captains?

                         ROSS
                    Yes, but they don't really
                    need them. it's just a throw-
                    back to some sentimental sea-
                    faring baloney.

                         VERA
                    You will command the tankers to
                    sail toward a 50-mile area in the
                    middle of the Atlantic Ocean.

                         GUS
                    And do what?

                         ROSS
                    And do nothing. Just sit there.

                         GUS
                    Then how's all the people
                    gonna get their oil?

                         ROSS
                                (grins)
                    You catch on fast, old buddy.
                           (to VERA)
                    Tell him about the pumps. I
                    know how you love the part
                    about the pumps.

VERA takes the remote control clicker from ROSS, clicks it.

ON THE MAP -- the map of the world's oceans disappears and is replaced by a 
glowing, illuminated map of the United States. Little miniature oil derricks are 
shown clustered in all the oil-producing areas of the country.

                         VERA
                    Every pump in America is
                    run...


                         GUS
                    I know, by computers.

                         VERA
                    Will you stop interrupting ?!
                           (calming herself)
                    You will command the pumps to
                    stop pumping.

                         ROSS
                          (gleeful)
                    And then shut down the pipe lines.          

                         GUS
                    Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe
                    lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers
                    stop deliverin' oil. Man, this
                    is high stakes.

                         ROSS
                          (flattered)
                    Thanks, kiddo. now, listen, 
                    this part's important. I want
                    you to program one special 
                    command into all these systems.
                    Tell them these orders are
                    irreversible, so it'll be
                    impossible for anybody to 
                    switch them back. Can you
                    do that, pal?

ON GUS -- a pause. he looks upset about something, building up his nerve to say 
it. Then:

                         GUS
                    Lookit, you're getting' what you
                    want all the time. it ain't right
                    that I don't get somethin'! I
                    never get somethin'!

                         ROSS
                    I knew it, I knew it, go be nice
                    to people and they think they
                    can ask for the moon!

                         GUS
                          (het up)
                    The moon! Listen, man, when I
                    was a little bitty kid all my 
                    friends got them electric trains 
                    for Christmas. My mama didn't
                    have barely enough to pay the
                    electric bill, let alone buy me no
                    train set.


                         VERA
                    This sounds like it's going to 
                    be sad. I'm leaving.

She leaves the room.

                         GUS
                    Now...when do I get a taste?

                         ROSS
                        (naked threat)          
                    I should think a taste of freedom
                    is enough, don't you? Or would
                    you prefer jail?

                         GUS
                         (defiantly)
                    Don't lay that jail number on me
                    no more. You need me out here
                    doin' stuff for you more'n sitten'
                    in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.
                         (pointedly)
                    'Sides, I be known' some heavy
                    stuff about you now. You don't
                    want em spillin' the coffee beans.

Before ROSS can even ask her, LORELEI discretely leaves the room. The TWO MEN 
are alone.

                         ROSS
                    Is this blackmail?

                         GUS
                    Don't be getting' racist with me,
                    man.

                         ROSS
                    Is this whitemail?

                         GUS
                    Fair's fair.

                         ROSS
                        (after a pause)
                    What do you want?

ON GUS -- He starts emptying the contents of his pockets on ROSS'S desk. It's 
all matchbooks, paper napkins, backs of envelopes, scrap paper. Drawings and 
plans and numbers are scrawled on all of them.

ON ROSS -- looking at this pile of crumpled effluvia. he reaches down and picks 
up his waste basket, holds it up to GUS.

                         ROSS
                    A waste-basket?
                         GUS
                    Those are plans.
                        (as ROSS eyes
                         them skeptically)
                    Blueprints.

                         ROSS
                    For what?

                         GUS
                    A computer.

                         ROSS
                    We've already got some.

                         GUS
                    Not like this one you ain't.
                    Nobody in the world got one
                    like this 'cause it don't exist
                    yet. We got to build it.

                         ROSS
                          (impressed)
                    You designed it?

                         GUS
                         (proudly)
                    I invented it, man. In my head.
                    It's a stone killer-diller get-down
                    get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday 
super mutha computer.

     ROSS
      (intrigued)
What will it do?

     GUS
Everything.

     ROSS
What will it get me?

     GUS
Anything.

     ROSS
     (a big genial smile)
Tell me more...

INT. WEBCO DATA PROCESSING CENTER - NIGHT

All alone in the computer room, GUS sits at his console and starts trying out 
coordinates.



EXT. OCEAN - DAY OR NIGHT

STOCK FOOTAGE -- SHOTS of super-tankers moving at full speed through the ocean 
waters from various directions.

EFFECTS: ON ILLUMINATED WALL MAP -- Electronic 'tanker' blips begin to amass 
together on ROSS'S map.

EXT. TEXAS OIL FIELD - DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT -- a Texas oil field, dotted with derricks as afar as the eye 
can see, all of them pumping away, up and down, up and down.

ON AN OIL RIG SUPERVISOR, a guy in a hard hat, looking at his clipboard as he 
checks the day's productivity.

Sound: the regular throbbing sound of the oil pumps.

Suddenly, the sound stops. It takes a moment for the absence of noise to 
register on the SUPERVISOR. Then he looks up, astonished.

POV: WIDE SHOT -- all the pumps stop pumping.

EXT. PIPELINE, DESERT (OR ALASKAN LANDSCAPE) - DAY

TWO WORKER with puzzled expression crouch beside a section of oil pipeline. One 
keeps turning the tap over a little valve-faucet, but nothing comes out.

EXT. SKY ABOVE CANYON - DAY

ON A HELICOPTER -- unmarked, as it comes to a careful landing, coming down in 
the crevasse of a reddish-colored canyon, dropping past the striated canyon 
walls.

ON THE GROUND -- the chopper touches down. WORKERS IN UNMARKED COVERALLS rush to 
unload crates from the craft.

CLOSE ON ONE CRATE -- as it's lifted off, MOVE INTO a strip of tape pasted on 
the side. The tape has come loose, flapping in the wind from the chopper blades, 
revealing what it was meant to cover: stenciled letters that say "WEBCO."

INT. ROSS'S "WAR ROOM" - DAY

ON A TINY GREEN BOAT-SHAPED BLIP on an illuminated map. FOLLOW THE BLIP as it 
crosses the map, joining a whole herd of other boat-shaped blips massed in the 
center. As it moves into place:

Sound: Someone applauds and utters a small female "yay!"

WIDE SHOT -- LORELEI is applauding. ROSS is standing beside the map, admiring 
the glowing convoy. VERA does not look so happy.

                         ROSS
                    That's it! The last tanker!
                    They're all mine now! All...

                         VERA
                    Not quite. What is that in the 
                    lower right hand corner?

ON THE MAP -- sure enough, in the lower right hand corner, one little green 
boat-shaped blip is heading further away from the others. toward America.

                         ROSS
                        (snarling)
                    It's a tanker! And it's going
                    the wrong way!

EXT. OCEAN - DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT: LONG WIDE -- one super tanker all by itself in the ocean, 
nowhere near any others.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM, SUPER-TANKER - DAY

The FIRST MATE tears off the printout sheet emerging from a large computer. 
FOLLOW HIM as he takes it, frowning and shaking his head, into the Captain's 
Bridge next door.

INT. CAPTAIN'S BRIDGE, SUPER-TANKER - DAY

The grizzled CAPTAIN looks up from his charts as the FIRST MATE hands him the 
printout sheet.

                         FIRST MATE
                         (looking down at it)
                    There it is again, Sir. "Proceed
                    immediately to latitude 241,
                    longitude 73. There await
                    further orders."

                         CAPTAIN
                         (riled)
                    That's the middle of the Atlantic
                    Ocean! And I am not taking my
                    ship out there to just sit, no matter
                    what no damn machine says. We're
                    supposed to go to Metropolis and
                    we're going to Metropolis!

EXT. STATUE OF LIBERTY - TWILIGHT

LONG ESTABLISHING SHOT -- the statue of liberty at twilight, just like a 
postcard. But closer up:

WIDE ANGLE -- A SMALL CROWD OF TOURISTS is milling around at the base of the 
statue, peering upwards and murmuring excitedly. Nearby a POLICE LIEUTENANT and 
a POLICE CAPTAIN are also peering anxiously up at the statue as the CAPTAIN 
calls through a bullhorn.



ON THE CAPTAIN
     
                         CAPTAIN
                    Miss? Miss, can you hear me?
                    Don't jump! Don't despair!
                          (fervently)
                    You have everything to live for.
                    I know, I've seen you.

EXT. CROWN, STATUE OF LIBERTY - TWILIGHT

In the crown of the statue, LORELEI waits like a siren on a rock, wearing 
clinging wisps of silk that reveal more than they conceal. her long hair tosses 
in the wind, her eyes sparkle like fabulous jewels, her parted lips glisten. She 
sits on the edge of the crown, dangling her legs over the side...a precarious, 
if provocative, position.

ON SKY -- SUPERMAN stops in mid-flight, hovers, and lands lightly on the ledge 
of the crown.

                         LORELEI
                         (breathy, but cool)
                    I thought you'd never get here.

                         SUPERMAN
                         (super-cool, but
                           looking her over)
                    Hey, don't expect me to save
                    you. Because I don't do that
                    anymore.

                         LORELEI
                         ( a little smile)
                    Don't worry. I'm long past
                    saving.

She uncoils. She rises sinuously. She stretches.

ON SUPERMAN -- watching her.

ON LORELEI -- the sunset lighting her from behind, haloing her hair, outlining 
her incredible body.

TWO SHOT -- he just stands there. But the chemistry between them is 
overwhelming. And part of it is the challenge: who is going to make the first 
move?

                         LORELEI
                    Well, don't let me keep you
                    from anything.

                         SUPERMAN
                    I'm in no rush.
                         (he steps toward her)
                    So what do you have in mind?


                         LORELEI
                        (lowering her eyes)
                    Lots of things...

                         SUPERMAN
                          (tipping her chin)
                    Tell me.

He steps closer to her. She comes closer to him, looking into his mesmeric eyes.

                         LORELEI
                         (leaning into him)
                    I'll do more than tell you.
                    I'll show you, back at my place.
                    If you'll just do me one little
                    favor first.

                         SUPERMAN
                        (giving in)
                    Okay, what is it? You want
                    a ride?

                         LORELEI
                    Never.
                         (she giggles)
                    I get air-sick. You wouldn't
                    like that.

                         SUPERMAN
                    No, I don't think I would. So...
                    then what can I do for you?

                         LORELEI
                    It isn't much, really, you see,
                    there's this little boat. Well,
                    not so little, really. And it's 
not going where it's supposed
to go and...

                    SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SKY ABOVE OCEAN - DAY

SUPERMAN flies. His costume is now getting really sinister: the blue is navy, 
the red is close to purple, the yellow a dull brown. His face is unpleasantly 
gaunt, full of craggy hollows, with an unpleasant curl to the corners of his 
mouth.

EFFECTS: Again, that fleeting subliminal moment where we SEE the face of CLARK 
KENT trying to emerge, then vanish.

Alone in the slate gray sky, SUPERMAN looks down upon the ocean.

ANGLE DOWN -- there is the one tanker heading for America.

WIDE -- SUPERMAN swoops down on the ship.

EXT. OCEAN. TANKER - DAY

SUPERMAN flies down to the hull. He grabs the seam and, and with brute Super-
Strength rips a great hole. then, like a lava flow, oil begins to gush out of 
the hole, pouring into the sea.

INT. THE CAPTAINS BRIDGE - DAY

ON THE CAPTAIN -- aghast as he watches the destruction.

EXT. OCEAN - DAY

AERIAL SHOT -- now we can SEE the terrible oil spill beginning to form. Its 
dimensions will be awesome. Even as we WATCH, it gets larger.

EXT. SKY - DAY

SUPERMAN, blithely unconcerned with it all, flies away from the havoc he has 
created.

EXT. WEBSTER PENTHOUSE TERRACE - TWILIGHT

WIDE SHOT as SUPERMAN lands on the terrace -- his place of assignment.

TO HIS RIGHT, the "ski resort" area.

ON SUPERMAN -- as he touches down. he looks around. Then, from offscreen, 
LORELEI'S voice:

                         LORELEI (o.s.)
                    Hi. In here...

SUPERMAN looks in the direction of the voice.

POV: LORELEI lays on the shaggy rug in front of the roaring fire-place, wearing 
figure-hugging thermals.

                         LORELEI
                         (seductively)
                    How about a little apres-ski?

As he starts to walk toward her:

INT. VERA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

In a bedroom so spartan and spare it looks like a nun's chamber, VERA reads in 
bed. She wears a nightgown that looks like a prisoner's outfit in the Gulag 
Archipelago.

CLOSER -- the book she reads, a big, spiral-bound notebook, is titled "COMPUTER 
SCIENCE: INTERMEDIATE LEVEL." She finishes the last page, closes the book, 
reaches to her bedside table, and starts to read the next book" "ADVANCED 
COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY."



INT. CAVE - DAY

The machine that GUS has designed is being assembled. TWO WORKERS lower a 
massive generator in place. The word "GENERATOR" is stenciled on it.

PAN FROM THEM to the FOREMAN and his ASSISTANTS, as he scratches his head, 
trying to puzzle out the assembly directions written (by GUS) on a cocktail 
napkin and a matchbook.

EXT. STATE DEPARTMENT. BUILDING, WASHINGTON D.C.

ESTABLISHING SHOT

INT. BRIEFING ROOM, STATE DEPT. - DAY

A GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN is a briefing assembled REPORTERS.

                         STATE DEPT. MAN
                    The choppy seas may be a blessing,
                    they ought to contain the oil spill
                    for at least two weeks before it
                    reaches the Nantucket current.

                         A REPORTER
                    Then what?

                         STATE DEPT. MAN
                    After that, it's just a question of
                    which part of the East Coast gets
                    the brunt of the spill.

                         SECOND REPORTER
                    How big is it now?

                         STATE DEPT. MAN
                    Almost a mile long.

EXT. GAS STATION AND ADJOINING COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A hand-lettered sign beside the gas pumps where TWO ATTENDANTS are working 
frantically, pumping gas into cars. The sign reads: 1/2 TANK TO A CUSTOMER."

PAN A BARELY MOVING, SEEMINGLY ENDLESS LINE OF VEHICLES waiting for this ration. 
Families are eating, sleeping, and quarreling in their cars. There are sporadic, 
senseless bursts of horn-blowing. A middle-aged STATION WAGON DRIVER is leaning 
on his horn as he and his WIFE try to break into the bumper-to-bumper line. The 
DRIVE BEHIND THEM isn't giving an inch. 

                         DRIVER BEHIND
                    Get to the back like everybody
                    else!

NEW ANGLE -- The STATION WAGON DRIVER decides to take matters into his own hands 
and rams his way in. he makes the attempt, smashing into the DRIVER BEHIND, 
crumpling his front fender.
That did it. The DRIVER BEHIND, enraged, leaps out of his car and charges toward 
the guy who hit him. The STATION WAGON DRIVER gets out, ready for combat.

                         DRIVER BEHIND
                    You sonofa---

                         STATION WAGON DRIVER'S WIFE
                    Charley! Charley!

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The CUSTOMERS of this greasy spoon are shivering in coats and scarves. Everyone 
turns as STAION WAGON DRIVER'S WIFE suddenly rushes in, hysterical.

                         STATION WAGON DRIVER'S WIFE
                    Help! Somebody help! My husband...
                    he got beaten up! Call the police.
                    Please, call an ambulance! Do 
                    something!

A WAITRESS goes to a wall phone to call for help. ANOTHER WAITRESS pulls out a 
First Aid kit and hands it to a MAN AT THE COUNTER.

                         FIRST WAITRESS
                    Here, Jack. Go with her, okay?
                    Take a look at him.
                        (as JACK hurries out with
                          the anguished WIFE, the
                            WAITRESS shakes her 
                           head:)
                    Somebody's behind this. You can't 
                    tell me there's no oil. You can't
                    tell me somebody isn't getting
                    rich off this. There's always
                    getting rich...and it's always the 
                    little guy who suffers.

PAN THE COUNTER -- pat the other DINERS, nodding and murmuring angry assent -- 
to the last stool. There sits the original LITTLE GUY himself: GUS. He keeps his 
head down, silently stirring is coffee as he finally realizes the harm he's 
helped to create.

INT. ROSS WEBSTER'S OFFICE - DAY

C.U. ROSS -- brimming with good cheer.

                         ROSS
                    Cheer up, Gus, I have good
                    news. Your computer is being
                    built as we speak.

REVERSE -- A gloomy GUS, seated across the desk, looks up with a flicker of 
interest.

                         GUS
                    Yeah? How's it look?

                         ROSS
                    It looks wonderful. it is
                    wonderful, let's face it.

                         GUS
                    I told you it wasn't no jive.

                         ROSS
                         (intensely)
                    Gus, it seems we are talking
                    state-of-the-art technology here.
                    We are talking unlimited power.
                    We are talking "get-down hot-cha
                    daddy-o" whatever you called it.

                         GUS
                    Stone mutha.

                         ROSS
                    Exactly. Stoned mother.

ROSS gets up, comes over to GUS, looking him in the eyes.

                         ROSS
                         (calculating, 
                           manipulating)
                    But a machine this powerful is
                    going to make powerful enemies.
                    People who will want to destroy
                    it.

                         GUS
                         (upset by the idea)
                    Ain't nobody gonna mess with
                    my machine! I'll...I'll... what
                    will I do?
                         (sudden inspiration)
                    I'll build in a counter-punch!
                    Anything attacks it gets counter-
                    attacked! And wiped out!

                         ROSS
                    Can you do that?

                         GUS
                    Yeah, sure.
                        (angrily)
                    Ain't nobody gonna stomp 
                    my electric train...






ON ROSS

                         ROSS
                    Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't
                    want anything except to keep on
                    being a machine. You've got to 
                    make sure it can figure out how
                    to beat any opponent.

ON GUS

                         GUS
                    Man, all it got to do is find
                    their weak spot.
                          (he starts drawing out
                            a plan on ROSS'S
                            desk blotter)
                    You bet on the machine in any
                    fight you name, you gonna win
                    your bet.

GUS sketches furiously as ROSS beams in approval at this initiative.

INT. CAVE - DAY

The WORKMEN in coveralls are assembling what is beginning to look like something 
out of Fritz Lang's Metropolis: fantastic, incredible, and it hasn't even been 
half-built yet. In F. G. GUS'S scrap papers have been spread out on a board, in 
an attempt to make it look like a blueprint.     

INT. LANA'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

LANA is talking into a phone on the wall. Right beside her at the kitchen table 
RICKY is doing his homework.

                         LANA
                        (into the phone
                          wearily)
                    No, I cannot go out with you
                    tonight...No, I'm busy tomorrow
                    night too.

INT. SMALLVILLE BAR - AFTERNOON

A slightly drunk and very pushy BRAD is using the pay phone.

                         BRAD
                    Doing what?







INT. LANA'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

                         LANA
                         (into phone)
                    I'll think of something.
               Look, I've got to go. Ricky     
                    needs me.
                          (she hangs up and
                            leans over RICKY,
                             pointing to a math
                            problem on his page)
                    The first part of the problem
                    is okay, honey, but here I 
                    think--

Sound: The phone rings again.

                         LANA
                          (picking up the
                            phone but still
                            talking to RICKY)
                    -- you've got the wrong number.
                           (into phone)
                    No, not you. I wish you'd get
                    the wrong number.
                            (almost pleading)
                    Brad, please stop calling me.
                    I've told you--
                            (to RICKY)
                    --four times forty and then
                    divide five. Give it another.

INT. SMALLVILLE BAR - AFTERNOON

                         BRAD
                          (getting really surly)
                    I'm getting a little tired of 
                    trying, Lana. Why don't you
                    wise up? Now that Cluck Kent's
                    flown the coop, you'd better start 
appreciating ole faithful Brad. What
else've you got in Smallville?

INT. LANA'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

ON LANA - Disgusted, she hangs up, but then just stands there brooding on that 
bleak truth.

                         LANA
                          (to herself)
                    What else have I  got in 
                    Smallville?

She picks up the phone again, dials and waits.


INT. DAILY PLANET, CLARK KENT'S DESK - AFTERNOON

The phone rings on CLARK'S empty desk rings and rings and rings.

INT. LANA'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

As LANA hangs up slowly, RICKY turns to her, holding up his math paper.

                         RICKY
                         (hesitantly)
                    Mom? I think I've got the
                    answer...

                         LANA
                          (suddenly, resolute)
                    So do I.
                           (she picks up the
                             phone again and
                             dials quickly)
                    Smallville Airport? What
                    flights do you have to
                    Metropolis tomorrow?

EXT. STREET CORNER, METROPOLIS - DAY

ON A CROWD gathered on a street corner in Metropolis. They are bunched together, 
muttering and distressed. looking at something across the street. We hear 
comments along the line of "This I can't believe."

WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT IS: A neighborhood bar across the street. Inside is 
SUPERMAN. Drinking. Drinking whiskey.

INT. BAR - DAY

He sits hunched over at the bar, glowering. His costume is now completely black: 
his once manly, open face has become truly sinister. THE BARTENDER and the few 
CUSTOMERS give him a wide berth. This is not a guy you want to mess with.

We get a look at TWO OF THE DENZIENS of the bar: a pair of really mean, ornery 
customers. One has an eye-patch and a scar, the other a shaved head and a 
mustache. And even these two keep their distance from SUPERMAN.

He upends a bowl of peanuts on the bar. Then, with malicious pleasure, he begins 
flipping them, one at a time, at the rows of glasses stacked up on the shelf 
behind the bar. Ping: Crash! Ping! Crash! In the style of a Cagney punk spraying 
the4 bar with machine-gun bullets, he just wrecks the joint, since the peanuts, 
flipped with Super-Strength, have the projectile force of bullets. Then, bored 
with the target practice, he shoots a beam of Heat-Vision at the mirror itself.

EFFECTS: the glass melts.

EXT. STREET CORNER, METROPOLIS - DAY

NEW ANGLE: LOOKING DWON AT THE STREET - A taxi comes down the street, but can't 
move past the intersection because of the gathering crowd.
INT. TAXI - DAY

DRIVER in front seat; LANA and RICKY in back.

                         DRIVER
                    I can't get though, lady.
                    Something's going on here.

ON RICKY -- curious.

                         RICKY
                    I wanna see what's happening.

Before LANA can stop him, he opens his door and goes out to join the CROWD. LANA 
has no choice but to follow him.

ON TH EPART OF THE CROWD where RICKY and LANA stand.

                         WOMAN
                    It's a disgrace, that's what it is.

                         MAN
                    I'll tell you one thing, boy,
                    nobody'll ever trust that creep
                    again. He's washed up.

ON RICKY -- stunned as he SEES what they see.

POV: The door to the bar swings open and the surly, ornery, snarling SUPERMAN 
comes out into the street.

ON THE CROWD -- instinctively pulling back.

NEW ANGLE -- a nearby building is notable for its peculiar façade: a series of 
porthole-like windows rising in vertical columns. SUPERMAN looks at it, then 
very deliberately stomps his foot hard on the ground.

ON THE BUILDING -- the first five floors of portholes light up, like a column 
light ascending. The image recalls one of those carnival Test-Your-Strength 
machines. And so is for SUPERMAN, who now stomps much harder. And this time the 
column of lights shoots all the way up to the top floor of the building.

SUPERMAN smiles sneeringly, proud of his prowess.

C.U. RICKY -- tears in his eyes. PULL BACK AND WIDEN as he pushes his way to the 
front of the crowd.

                         RICKY
                    Superman!

LANA struggles through, trying to get to him.

ON SUPERMAN -- his eyes flick toward the sound of his name.


ON RICKY

                         RICKY
                    Superman, it's me, Ricky!
                    Ricky from Smallville!

A MAN next to RICKY tries to pull him back to safety.

                         MAN
                    Be careful, kid!

                         RICKY
                        (wrought-up, 
                          voice breaking)
                    Superman, tell them you won't 
                    hurt anybody!

ON SUPERMAN -- starting to walk away, but something in RICKY'S plea halts him 
momentarily. He turns, looks at the BOY. For a second, there seems to be a 
flicker of understanding in his eyes. Then he scowls and continues to lope off 
down the street.

ON THE CROWD -- LANA manages to get to RICKY'S side. She is protective, fearful.

                         LANA
                         (this is very hard
                          for her to say)
                    Ricky, he's changed.

C.U. RICKY -- tears in his eyes, defiantly refusing to let his idol be 
castigated.

                         RICKY
                    No!
                         (desperately thinking
                          of excuses)
                    Maybe...maybe he's just sick!
                    Sometimes when I'm sick I get
                    real cranky and mean, Mom, you
                    even told me that.

ON SUPERMAN in F.G. as he walks away; the CROWD in B.G.

                         RICKY
                    Superman, please get better!

Again, that odd hesitation in SUPERMAN'S basically snarling attitude. Then, 
wolf-like, he keeps going.

ON LANA and RICKY.

                         LANA
                        (her heart is breaking
                         for her son's lost
                         illusions)
                    He's not listening to you, Ricky.

                         RICKY
                    Yes he is! He can hear me! He's
                    got Super-Hearing.

C.U. SUPERMAN -- now at least two blocks away. RICKY'S voice rings across the 
empty space:

                         RICKY
                    You can hear me, can't you,
                    Superman? I know you're
                    going to be all right! You're
                    just in a slump! You'll be great
                    again. You can do it, Superman!

Trying to shake it off, the evil SUPERMAN suddenly lurches into the sky and 
flies off. ANGLE UP TO SEE HIM GO.

EXT. SKY - TWILIGHT

ON THE EVIL SUPERMAN as he flies.

Soundtrack: Echoing in SUPERMAN'S mind, the voice of RICKY is heard, pleading 
again and again.     

                         RICKY'S VOICE
                             (Electronically enhanced
                          to a sound overpowering)
                    You're      just in a slump! You'll be 
great again. Great again! Please
get better! Please get better!
Superman! Get better!

The voice torments SUPERMAN. He winces, as if beset by stabbing migraine 
headaches, as the voice grows louder and denser, one sentence (electronically) 
overlapping the next so that it begins to sound like a whole chorus of Rickies. 
It becomes sheer torture, as if his dormant conscience was punishing him. He 
can't fight off the pain. Finally, he drops from the sky to:

EXT. AUTOMOBILE GRAVEYARD - TWILIGHT

At first we cannot tell where we are. The EVIL SUPERMAN, black garbed, lands on 
his knees in a landscape that looks like the end of the world: dark piles of 
twisted metal, debris, small fires burning here and there. It could be hell. But 
it is, in fact, an automobile graveyard.

ON HIM CLOSE -- as he struggles to his feet, the stabbing pains in his head 
tormenting him, the distorted and all-pervading sound of RICKY'S pleas continue 
to ring out in his brain. As this reaches a crescendo, an extraordinary thing 
begins to happen:
EFFECTS: emerging from the body of the EVIL SUPERMAN comes the form of CLARK 
KENT. The CLARK persona wrests itself apart from the EVIL SUPERMAN until there 
are now two separate identities made manifest ON THE SCREEN -- the good part of 
him and the bad part have split. It is the ultimate expression of the schizoid 
aspects of this dual SUPERMAN/CLARK character, now locked in mortal combat.



EVIL SUPERMAN gets to his feet, looks with undisguised venom at CLARK. WIDE 
ANGLE LETS US NOW SEE where we are: the heaps of twisted metal are car body 
parts, stacked up in mounds, row upon row of mashed and flattened auto wrecks. 
Elsewhere we WILL SEE piles of old tires, piles of bumpers and fenders. And in 
addition, the tools and machines of this trade: great cranes with giant magnets 
that lift the cars on high, vats of acid that strip them, hydraulic pressing 
machines that squash and flatten them into metal pancakes, formidable-looking 
metal shredders that rip steel apart into strips.

The workers who operate the various machines WILL BE SEEN at odd moments during 
the following, reacting with fear and then running for safety.

Not all of theses can be SEEN as yet, however, as the surly, gaunt SUPERMAN 
looks balefully at the forthright, fists-clenched figure of CLARK KENT.

                         CLARK
                    Give up. Give in.

                         (EVIL) SUPERMAN
                    Like hell I will.

And with that, he hauls off and socks CLARK in the jaw with such tremendous 
force that it sends him hurtling backwards into a pile of axles. They clatter 
and crash to the ground with an enormous clanging of noise. 

ON SUPERMAN -- rubbing his knuckles, That hurt, and we realize that CLARK KENT 
is just as strong as SUPERMAN.

ON CRANE OPERATOR -- startled reaction. Quick departure.

ON THE PILES OF AXLES -- CLARK nowhere to be seen. Then, from an unseen vantage 
point, his voice booms out:

                         CLARK (o.s.)
                    I can give as good as I get.
                    Are you willing to risk it?

ON SUPERMAN, whirling around, trying to locate him.

                         SUPERMAN
                           (defiantly)
                    Try me!

From out of the pile of rubble, CLARK comes charging directly at SUPERMAN, head 
down like a bull. He butts him full force in the gut, sending SUPERMAN tumbling 
backwards. ANOTHER WORKER runs off.

NEW ANGLE -- behind the falling SUPERMAN is a great vat marked:

DANGER ---ACID

with a skull and crossbones stenciled on it.

Unable to halt this backward momentum, SUPERMAN falls into the vat of acid.


ANGLE IN -- he disappears in the smoking, steaming bubbles, submerged in the 
acid bath. An ordinary mortal would be all bones in seconds, but -- suddenly the 
EVIL SUPERMAN comes flying out of the vat.

ON HIM AS HE LANDS NEARBY -- a terrifying sight: smoke is issuing from all parts 
of him, curling off his body. He looks positively demonic. In a flurry, he turns 
on CLARK, and hands cupped with acid, he:

EFFECTS: blows a stream of burning acid directly at him.

ON CLARK -- the acid ignites his clothing as it lands on him.

EFFECTS: his jacket burns off, leaving him in shirtsleeves. 

ON SUPERMAN -- sneering.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Man, I never did like you. 
                    You always got on my nerves.

He grabs a bumper and swings it like a baseball bat, hitting CLARK in side, 
knocking him down.

ON CLARK -- hurt, shaken, but managing to get to his feet. 

                         CLARK
                    Come to think of it, you
                    always got under my skin.

And with that, he leaps on the EVIL SUPERMAN, knocking him to the ground.

CLOSER ON THEM as they roll and grapple across the debris-strewn earth. Behind 
them, looms a pit, which neither can see as yet.

IN THE PIT -- we SEE the flattened shapes of what once were auto wrecks, smashed 
into rectangular metal pancakes by hydraulic press, which looms above the pit.

ON THE TWO OF THEM WRESTLING -- with a mighty heave, SUPERMAN sends CLARK 
crashing into the open pit.

ON CLARK -- he lands on top of the flattened cars and lays there, stunned.

ON SUPERMAN -- he quickly activates the hydraulic control. 

NEW ANGLE -- the great iron press begins to descend on the still unmoving form 
of CLARK KENT.

CLOSER -- it comes down and begins to squash CLARK flat. It presses harder and 
harder. We hear SUPERMAN'S terrible, evil laughter.

ON SUPERMAN -- convinced that he has vanquished his foe, he starts to walk away.

ON CLARK, IN THE PIT -- with superhuman strength, he grips the edges of the 
hydraulic press and slowly, slowly, pushes it up and off his body. A difficult 
feat even for him. Quickly now, he slithers out from under it.
ON CLARK -- scrambling out of the pit, racing toward a stack of tires.

ON SUPERMAN -- about fifty feet away, striding off, thinking he's won. 
Suddenly...

EFFECTS: tires come flying through the air and ring SUPERMAN like horseshoes 
landing on a stake. He's startled, to say the least, as first one tire spins 
around like a big hula hoop, then a second, then a third. For a moment he is 
immobilized.

ON CLARK --  coming at him.

ON SUPERMAN -- he bursts his rubber bonds like a Hercules bursting his chains, 
by expanding his arms.

                         SUPERMAN
                           (snarling)
                    Man, you're finished!

He looks up.

POV: ABOVE CLARK IS A CRANE and hanging from it, directly above his head, is one 
of those enormous flat-bottomed magnets they use to lift up the automobile 
wrecks and move them.

EFFECTS: the EVIL SUPERMAN sends rays of red-hot Heat-Vision shooting from his 
eyes, aimed at the links of chain, which hold the magnet. The chain glows, 
melts, and then the magnet drops with full force on CLARK -- smashing him right 
through the ground.

NEW ANGLE -- all is still for a moment. Then, shooting up from underground in 
another area, comes CLARK KENT. He lifts a battered car fender from the ground, 
raises it high above his head and hurls it at SUPERMAN.

The object hits him head-on and sends him crashing backwards. Flying through the 
air, smashing into an enormous mountain of piled-up body parts. The last WORKMAN 
runs for his life.

ON CLARK -- stepping into a clearing.

                         CLARK
                    Come on out and fight like 
                    a man!

Suddenly, a hail of wheel rims comes flying at him, hurled with tremendous 
force, like deadly Frisbees.

ON SUPERMAN -- some distance away, flinging the wheel rims.

ON CLARK, CLOSE one wheel rim sizzles through the air and strikes him in the 
side of the head, hitting his temple with such impact that it knocks him to the 
ground unconscious.

WIDE ANGLE -- SUPERMAN, triumphant, strides over to the fallen body of CLARK, 
lifts him in his arms. FOLLOW HIM as he takes the unconscious CLARK to:

THE METAL SHREDDER -- the frightening machine has teeth like a crocodile and its 
steel rollers and innards seem menacing even when still. An old wreck is on the 
conveyer belt, ready in place to be fed into the shredder.
SUPERMAN drops CLARK to the ground and flips on the switch.

ON THE MACHINE -- we SEE it work now. The conveyer belt starts up, and the car 
is fed into the jaws of the machine.

Sound: A terrible, ear-piercing screeching and grinding of metal as the car is 
chewed by the shredder.

We SEE what happens: smoke rises, and pieces of shrapnel go flying and from out 
the extruding end, what was moments before recognizable as a battered auto, 
comes out as long, jagged strips of metal.

NEW ANGLE -- contemptuously, SUPERMAN kicks the unconscious CLARK KENT onto the 
conveyer belt. 

CLOSER -- as CLARK'S body moves along the conveyer belt and is fed into the 
teeth and jaws of the metal shredder.

EFFECTS: it begins its terrible work. But -- suddenly, the teeth start to snap 
off and fly in all directions. The metal casing snaps and cracks. Sparks, 
terrific sparks everywhere. Smoke rising as if the motor were burning itself 
out. The machine, with an awful noise, self-destructs.

And CLARK KENT emerges with fury in his eyes.

Without a word, he leaps onto SUPERMAN, pinning him to the ground, his hands 
around his neck. For a moment, SUPERMAN seems to be fighting him off, almost 
rolling him over, but then CLARK gets a better grip on him.

                         CLARK
                        (intense, as he 
                         chokes him)
                    Give up! Give up! Give up!

The EVIL SUPERMAN clutches at CLARK'S hands, trying to pull loose. And then...

EFFECTS: An amazing sight. Slowly, the figure of EVIL SUPERMAN begins to grow 
less 'real,' fading in density, beginning to become opaque, then translucent. 
Then the amorphous figure begins to be drawn and absorbed into the CLARK KENT 
figure until  at last there is no EVIL SUPERMAN beneath CLARK'S hands, but a 
strong, victorious CLARK who now stands up. NOW he walks TOWARD CAMERA as he 
opens his shirt buttons. We SEE the true "S" underneath, in noble red and gold. 
IT FILLS FRAME.

ANGLE UP -- once again strong and handsome and good, SUPERMAN flies off.

EXT. OCEAN - DAY

AERIAL SHOT, WIDE ANGLE -- the enormous oil spill, stretching almost a mile 
long, floats on the sea, heading for the East Coast.

EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

The long lines of cars are longer than ever. ON THE FRONT OF THE LINE the 
STATION ATTENDANT puts up a new sign: OUT OF GAS. STATION CLOSED.

EXT. OIL FIELDS - DAY

The deserted oil fields: the pumps still.

EXT. SKY - DAY

Music: The stirring theme.

SUPERMAN flies to the rescue, soaring above the Atlantic Ocean. Now he looks 
down, sees the oil spill.

EFFECTS: IN VARIOUS HOTS, SUPERMAN descends to where he hovers above the waves. 
Before him the enormous lake of oil undulate in the choppy sea. He takes a deep 
breath and begins to blow Super-Breath.

FURTHER AWAY -- the super-tanker with the gaping hole in the side.

ON THE DECK -- A SEAMAN looks up astonished.

                         SEAMAN
                    My God! Look!

His MATES look where he points.

POV: LONG SHOT -- the oil slick is heading back toward the ship, sipping through 
the ocean rapidly. Behind it, in far B.G. SUPERMAN is continuing to blow a 
steady gust of Super-Breath.

EFFECTS: ON THE TANKER HULL -- as the oil is forced, against the current, to 
flow right back into the hull from which it escaped.

NEW ANGLE -- the last of the oil spill is blown back in. Immediately:

EFFECTS: ON SUPERMAN -- sending powerful beams of Heat-Vision from his eyes, he 
aims them at the gaping metal hull. 

ON THE HULL -- the Heat-Vision welds the hole together, repairing the ship. We 
hear cheers of the CREW off-screen.

INT. CAPTAIN'S BRIDGE - DAY

The CAPTAIN watches, amazed, as the now-recovered MAN OF STEEL lands just 
outside his bridge.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Captain, I'd like to apologize
                    for what I did before. I... I 
                    really wasn't myself.

                         CAPTAIN
                    That's all right, lad. All's well
                    that ends well, as they say.     



C.U. SUPERMAN -- jaw set, eyes narrow.

And with that, he takes off.

EXT. SKY - DAY

WIDE ANGLE SHOWS SUPERMAN flying above the ocean, heading inland.

CLOSER ON HIM -- suddenly, he spots something down below. A look of great 
concern on his face.

FULL SHOT -- he banks and starts straight down toward the sea.

ON THE SEA -- On a little island (just a tiny outcropping) stands a SEABIRD, its 
feathers coated with oil, unable to fly. SUPERMAN swoops down.

ON THE LITTLE ISLAND -- SUPERMAN lands there and lifts the bird in his hand.

                         SUPERMAN
                         (gently)
                    Here you go, little fella.

He softly blows the oil off the bird's feathers.

                         SUPERMAN
                    C'mon, you take the head start.

He tosses the bird up into the air.

EXT. SKY - DAY

The bird flies. SUPERMAN catches up and flies alongside for a while. Then he 
veers off.
          
                         SUPERMAN
                         (tipping his hand
                          in a little wave)
                    See you around the sky, pal.
                    Keep 'em flying.

He continues on his way.

EXT. SKY ABOVE METROPOLIS - DAY

FULL SHOT: WIDE -- SUPERMAN flies over the skyscrapers of Metropolis.

EXT. WEBSTER PENTHOUSE, TERRACE - DAY

SUPERMAN lands on the terrace of the Webster penthouse. He opens the door and 
enters.

INT. WEBSTER PENTHOUSE - DAY

INSERT: Just inside the doorway, right past the threshold is a little slab of 
plastic with a button sticking up. SUPERMAN unknowingly steps on the button.


EFFECTS: the button activates:

1. A big banner, which suddenly drops and
unfurls from the ceiling, festooned with
red, white, and blue bunting. Lettered
on the banner are the words:

     "HI SUPERMAN"

As the banner drops:

Music: Patriotic march theme plays.

Startled, SUPERMAN sees the greeting. A second later, he whirls around as:

2. The voice of ROSS WEBSTER booms out from 
a loud-speaker in the manner of a telephone
answering machine:

                    VOICE OF ROSS      
               Miss Lorelei Ambrosia isn't at home
               right now. If you'd care to leave a
               message, don't wait for the beep.
               Why not deliver it to her in person?

Suddenly, with a click, a video tape starts to appear on a  T.V. screen. it 
shows VERA, very formally seated at a desk, in one of her dark suits, addressing 
the viewer in her no-nonsense way.

3. The T.V. screen lights up, VERA appears.

VERA
                         (on T.V.)
                    Here is where you can find her, 
                    as well as the rest of us.

A panoramic view of the Grand Canyon appears on the T.V. screen. As voice of 
VERA continues over, as  a secue.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

EXT GRAND CANYON - DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT: the same view, now real, of one of nature's seven wonders. As 
we hear VERA'S voice-over.

                         VERA (v.o)
                    Do drop in.

AERIAL SHOT: ZOOM DOWN TO a startling sight. Atop one of the rocky cliffs in the 
middle of the giant gorge are FIVE TINY FIGURES. 2 MEN: 2 WOMEN, and a DONKEY.

NEW ANGLE -- Behind them, above the canyon, we SEE pylons and power lines; a 
major electrical power source is here.

GROUP SHOT: GUS is holding the donkey on a lead. ROSS, VERA, and LORELEI are 
adjusting curious devices attached by back-pack harnesses to their persons: 
individual hot-air balloons. ROSS and VERA have already blown theirs up and are 
adjusting the ballast. LORELEI is inflating hers, which, in contrast to the 
others' utilitarian gray, is a shocking pink balloon that matches her jump suit.
     

                         LORELEI
                    This is fun!

                         ROSS
                    Fun? The fun's just starting, hon.
                    Wait till Superman finds us, then
                    you'll see fun.
     
                         GUS
                         (confused)
                    You want to mess with Superman?
               
                         ROSS
                    Can't wait, pal, can't wait.

                         VERA
                          (impatiently)
                    Let's go. I want to be ready for
                    him when he falls into our trap.
                         (to GUS, irritably)
                    I don't see why you can't balloon
                    down like the rest of us.

ON GUS -- he looks at the gizmos, then looks over the ledge.

HIS POV: a sheer drop to the bottom of the canyon.

ON GUS -- shaking his head emphatically.

                         GUS
                    Uh-huh. No way, man. Not me.
                         (he climbs on
                          his donkey)
                    I just don't believe a man can
                    fly.

The DONKEY starts walking down the winding      path that will eventually take 
him down to the bottom of the canyon.

ROSS, VERA, and LORELEI activate their little hot-air gadgets and launch 
themselves off the edge of the cliff.

FULL SHOT, LONG: like invading paratroopers, the THREE of them waft down into 
the canyon, as GUS, SEEN TO FAR LEFT OF FRAME, rides his agile donkey down a 
footpath.

EXT. BASE OF GRAND CANYON

The Three land on the floor of the canyon and extricate themselves from the 
balloon rigs.
ANGLE UP -- GUS and his DONKEY are getting there, albeit a bit slower.

WIDE SHOT: the three of them walk towards the mouth of a large cave.

INT. CAVE

In sudden contrast to the bright sunlight outside, it is very dark in here.

                         LORELEI
                    I can't see anything.

                         VERA
                    Turn on the light.

                         LORELEI
                    Where's the light switch?

                         VERA
                    Where do you usually find a 
                    light switch?

ON LRELEI -- she feels along the cave wall right by the entrance, and, sure 
enough, finds a light switch. She flicks it on. 

REVERSE, WIDE ANGLE: the ultimate computer: four stories high with ladders 
leading up to different ledges and perches and cat-walks and walk-in alcoves set 
in the impressive, amazing façade. it looks like a leger vision of industrial 
technology giantism combined with futuristic hardware right out of science-
fiction.
                         
                         LORELEI (o.s.)
                    Wow, what a jukebox.

REVERSE --they look at it in awe.

                         ROSS
                    I told you, didn't I? The 
                    Ultimate Computer! It does
               everything any computer can 
do and a thousand things that
none of them do!

VERA starts toward the machine, officiously gesturing to the others:

                         VERA
                    Come on, let's give it a 
                    dry run.

                         ROSS
                    Wait for Gus to get here, sis.

                         VERA
                           (snidely)
                    Who needs Gus?


                         ROSS
                    He's the only one who can
                    operate this --

                         VERA
                    Like fish he is.
                         (sneering pride)
                    I know enough about computers
                    to put a PHD to shame.
                          (as they react
                            in surprise)
                    Come now, brother dear, you
                    didn't think I was going to let
                    that little man run the show, 
                    did you? Gus Gorman telling
                    us what to do -- I'd sooner
                    kiss a pig!

FAVORING VERA -- she crosses a wedge-shaped grid that extends out and over a 
moat-like area of circuitry beneath alternating wedges of clear glass and dense 
grid. She reaches the base of a ladder that runs up the center of the computer 
and starts to climb.

                         VERA
                    Come on, will you?
                          (as the others
                            follow her up)
                    We've got to get ready before
                    he gets here.

                         LORELEI
                    Gus?

                         VERA
                    Superman. The boy you left
                    behind.

ON VERA -- she peers down as she climbs up. looking into the central generator 
section below.

POV: Laying on the ground by the generator is an old cardboard coffee cup, a 
half-filled bottle of flat root-beer soda, a half-eaten Hostess Twinkie package, 
a screw-driver and some tools.

                         VERA
                        (with a moue 
                         of distaste)
                    Honestly, you'd think these
                    workmen would learn to tidy
                    up when they finish.

WIDE SHOT- The ascend to the central console on a deck midway up the front of 
the machine. There is a terrace filled with controls; it looks like the board of 
an elaborate light show up there.

NEW ANGLE-- In the Central Control where VERA stands, it looks like something at 
NASA: hundreds of buttons, lighted dials, video display screens, gauges, God-
knows-what. She sits in a chair located in the center that swivels to provide 
access to all the main controls.

ON VERA -- she throws some switches, pushes some buttons.

Sound: a low humming begins.

                         VERA
                        (to ROSS)
                    Bubba, engage those levers on
                    your right to activate the Alpha
                    Circuits and lock the modular
                    grid.

ROSS eventually starts to follow her orders.

WIDE SHOT: Suddenly, the left side of the four-story structure lights up in many 
wonderful ways: blinking lights, crackling electrodes, digital dials, and other 
illuminations.

                         VERA
                        (to LORELEI)
                    You! Activate circuits 29
                    through W7 and start Full     
                    Power Coordinates on
                    Exterior Defensive Systems:

                         LORELEI
                        (not cowed by
                         VERA'S jargon)
                    In other words, push this
                    red button.

She does so.

WIDE FULL SHOT: with a loud "clung!" the right side of the Ultimate Computer 
lights up in equally impressive ways. The thing is starting to look like the 
spaceship in Close Encounters.

EXT. SKY ABOVE GRAND CANYON - DAY

SUPERMAN is coming from the sky, scanning the area below, searching for them. He 
approaches the gorge.

NEW ANGLE, UP -- SUPERMAN flies into the grand Canyon.

A red light starts to flash.

Sound: a piercing electronic alarm goes off.

                         ROSS
                    He's here!


                         LORELEI
                        (delighted)
                    Oh, Superman!

                         VERA
                    Cut the mush, Lorelei. He's 
                    after our skin!

                         LORELEI
                    He can have mine. Anytime.

                         ROSS
                        (impatient, like a 
                         greedy child)
                    C'mon, sis, let the games begin!

EXT. CANYON - DAY

SUPERMAN flies into the canyon, hovers a moment, then starts to zoom toward the 
cave area.

INT. CAVE, ULTIMATE COMPUTER

                         VERA
                    All right, Bubba, enjoy yourself.

She guides her brother to a covered panel, flips it open. This reveals a large 
video screen and some controls. There is something familiar about this 
particular rig...

VERA goes back to the center console and pushes buttons and controls marked 
"EXTERIOR DEFENSE."

ON THE CONTROLS -- A panel board lights up: "MISSILE READY."

EXT. CANYON FLOOR - DAY

From underneath the canyon floor, sliding panels buried underneath the sandy 
terrain slide back, revealing small rockets on launching pads beneath.

NEW ANGLE -- from inside the missile it, we SEE the missile launcher slowly 
rising.

INT. CAVE, ULTIMATE COMPUTER

ON ROSS AT VIDEO SCREEN: he switches it on. The screen lights up. Ranged along 
the bottom are little computerized images of the rockets; coming down from the 
top of the screen is a little stick figure of a MAN with a cape. We suddenly 
realize what's familiar about this: it is the ultimate version an Atari "Space 
Invaders" video game. Except this time. it's being played for real.

EXT. CANYON FLOOR - DAY

The missile launchers, controlled by ROSS from within, rises out of the ground 
and spin around, searching for their target.

ON SUPERMAN -- flying down the canyon toward the missiles.
INT. CAVE, ULTIMATE COMPUTER

ROSS works the controls and fires rockets. On the video, just like in an 
electronic game arcade, we SEE the rockets heading up, aimed at the flying man. 
And:

                                             FAST CUT TO:

EXT. CANYON - DAY

Where the real life version is taking place, controlled by ROSS. Rockets fire up 
from the floor of the canyon, heading for SUPERMAN.

NEW ANGLE -- SUPERMAN has to dive and dart away.

                                             FAST CUT TO:

INT. CAVE, ULTIMATE COMPUTER

ROSS, totally manic, is having himself a wonderful time, playing his lethal 
Atari like an arcade champ. Grunts, groans, body english, etc.

EXT. CANYON - DAY

GUS, coming down the trail, looks at the spectacle taking place, fearful:

                         GUS
                    The rockets' red glare, 
                    the bombs burstin' in
                    air -- what in hell is
                    goin' on?

CROSS CUT BETWEEN:

1. ATARI SCREEN: Showing a barrage of
missiles aimed at the flying figure.

2. EXT. CANYON: SUPERMAN beset by
the missiles. He knocks some out of the
way, dodges others.

3. ROSS working the controls.

EXT. CANYON - DAY

SUPERMAN is hit by the final salvo of missiles and is THROWN OUT OF FRAME, 
tumbling over and over.

NEW ANGLE -- he is headed for a column of rock. he crashes into it.

INT. CAVE, ULTIMATE COMPUTER

ON THE VIDEO SCREEN -- The Atari-type game screen shows it all, including the 
"hit" and a High Score of 13,000 lights up.


ON ROSS -- gleeful, crazed:

                         ROSS
                    A hit! Got him! This will
                    give him something to 
think about!

C.U. VERA -- smiling fondly at her little brother enjoying himself.

INT. CAVE - DAY

GUS has reached the entrance, He gets off his DONKEY and enters. looking 
fearfully around him.

C.U. GUS - a bit awed as he sees what he has wrought.

                         GUS
                        (a moment of
                         quiet pride)
                    Awright. I got me my
                    electric train, mama. I 
                    finally got --
                        (suddenly upset
                         at what he sees)
                    Hey, what y'all doin' up
                    there?!

REVERSE:

                         ROSS
                    Join the party, genius!
                    Come on up!

EXT. CANYON - DAY

SUPERMAN, a bit dazed but basically unhurt, pulls himself up off the ruble of 
the stone column and flies downward.

INT. CAVE, ULTIMATE COMPUTER

GUS is coming up to the terrace where the central console is located.

REVERSE: WIDE -- SUPERMAN has landed and enters the cave. He stands framed in 
the doorway.

                         SUPERMAN
                        (in stentorian tones)
                    All right, Webster. Pack it in.

ON LORELEI -- waving from her perch.

                         LORELEI
                    Hi, honey.


                         SUPERMAN
                    I don't know you, lady.

                         LORELEI
                    But the other night...

                         SUPERMAN
                    That wasn't me. That guy's gone.
                        (to ROSS)
                    And you're next Webster.

                         VERA
                        (angrily)
                    Don't you threaten my Bubba!

INSERT: She presses a button.         

WIDE (SPECIAL EFFECTS): A tremendous ZAP of electrical energy, all blue and 
white, shoots out of the computer and zaps SUPERMAN with such a jolt that it 
knocks him to the ground.

                         ROSS
                    Welcome to the wonderful
                    world of computers, Superman.

ON SUPERMAN -- shakes his head, gets to his feet.

                         ROSS
                    Well, Superman? How do you
                    like Supermachine?

                         SUPERMAN
                    Typical of your kind, Webster.
                    Instead of using it to help others,
                    all the four of you want is to 
                    help yourselves. 

ON GUS -- who doesn't like the designation.

                         GUS
                    Four of us? What's he mean
                    four of us?
                        (calling out)
                    Hey, man!

                         LORELEI
                        (to GUS)
                    That's only his last name. He
                    likes to be called Super-man.

                         GUS
                    Hey, I ain't with them!



                         SUPERMAN
                    You could've fooled me, 
                    mister.

With that he starts to move menacingly toward the machine.

ON VERA -- she pushes another control button.

WIDE ANGLE -- suddenly, SUPERMAN walks into an invisible shield. There's nothing 
there we can SEE, but...

Sound: it makes a big thunk as he bangs into it.

C.U. SUPERMAN -- his features flattened by an invisible wall exactly as they 
would if he smashed into plate-glass.

NEW ANGLE -- he runs back a few steps, puts his head down and charges like a 
bull at the invisible force-field.

EFFECTS: A split-second after SUPERMAN hits the invisible shield, its substance 
wraps around him and encases him in a transparent bubble. Weird colored gasses 
churn inside the bubble; the impression is one of being trapped inside a hot, 
volatile enclosure with no air.

The bubble rises in the air and spins crazily around the vast interior. Inside, 
SUPERMAN tries to fight his way out: punching, pushing, kicking.

CLOSER ON HIM -- He's sweating in there, making a tremendous effort. Then, 
unable to break it with brute force, he narrows his eyes, then opens them wide 
and:

EFFECTS: Beams of Heat-Vision blaze from his eyes. Such is their power that they 
break the molecular structure of the prison and it crashes open. SUPERMAN breaks 
loose.

                         ROSS
                        (hysterical)
                    He's coming! He's going to 
                    hurt me!

                         VERA
                    Don't bet on it!

NEW ANGLE -- she slams a button (one larger and separate from the others) with 
full force.

EFFECTS: From the center of the machine, a large ball-like shape suddenly 
emanates a bright green ray we recognize immediately as being the color of 
Kryptonite. It hits SUPERMAN full force, a spot-light of death.

HE cries out in pain and drops to the ground, writhing in agony, dying before 
our eyes.

C.U. GUS -- frightened, horrified:

                         GUS
                    No! You'll kill him! That's
                    Kryptonite!


                         VERA
                        (insane, wild)
                    Yes! This time we got it right!

                         ROSS
                        (triumphant, raving)
                    It's your genius, pal! You
                    built a machine that can
                    find anybody's weak spot, 
                    just like you said.

C.U. GUS -- sick with the realization of what he's done.

                         ROSS
                    Congratulations, chum! you're
                    going to go down in history
                    as the man who killed Superman!

ON GUS -- He can't take it anymore. As SUPERMAN writhes in pain, GUS makes a 
quick decision. Running behind VERA, he looks down through the transparent floor 
at what is beneath:

POV: ZOOM INTO GENEORATOR

ON GUS -- he whips his yo-yo out of his pocket, pulls the string all the way 
out, throws it over one of the guy wires that anchor the machine to the floor. 
He jumps off the terrace, holding onto both ends (yo-yo and string) and slides 
down to the ground, a la Topkapi.

NEW ANGLE -- GUS charges into the generator area and grabs the wire connecting 
the computer to its energy source: the generator.

CLOSER -- one little screw coupling connects them. GUS grabs the screw-driver 
nearby and:

INSERT: simply unscrews one little screw.

ON THE MACHINE, WIDE ANGLE -- suddenly all the energy and power and electronic 
jazz just...stop. It just shuts off.

ON SUPERMAN -- the green Kryptonite ray shits off as well. he is saved from 
death, but weakened, on his knees.

ON THE TERRACE CONSOLE -- ROSS, enraged, looks down and sees what GUS has done.

                         ROSS
                    No! Give me that! Give
                    it to me!

He charges down the interior staircase, after GUS.

                         ROSS
                    Give it to me----

ON GUS -- he holds the little screw in his hand. As ROSS lunges for it, GUS pops 
it into his own mouth and tries to swallow it. But it gets caught in his own 
throat. He tries harder, his eyes straining with the effort, clearing his 
throat, gulping hard. Still it won't go down.

ROSS, in wild furry, grabs GUS, trying to pry his mouth open and retrieve it. 
The grapple. GUS shoves ROSS away and suddenly sees before him the open bottle 
of flat root beer soda. He grabs it, and with a mighty heave of his Adam's 
Apple, washes away the screw.

                         ROSS
                         (howling)
                    Nooooooo!

He starts to strangle GUS, trying to get the screw back. Then he switches to a 
violent attempt to perform the Heimlich Maneuver. GUS yanks free, spins around, 
hauls off and belts ROSS in the jaw. Pow! ROSS falls to the floor, out cold.

LONG SHOT: for a moment all is still. SUPERMAN is slowly rising to his knees.

                         SUPERMAN
                          (to GUS)
                    Thanks for --

When suddenly:

EFFESCTS: With an unearthly roar, the machine itself comes to life again. An 
even more terrifying life. It glows much hotter and brighter, crackling and 
pulsing with tremendous energy. LORELEI screams in terror.

                         LORELEI
                    Make it stop!     

ON VERA -- astonished, pushing buttons, trying to control it. 

                         VERA
                    I can't! It's out of control!

                         LORELEI
                    But how? Where's it getting the
                    power from ???!

VERA looks straight up. VERTICAL PAN (FAST) UP TO THE TOP OF THE COMPUTER.

EFFECTS: The machine is sending crackling lightening-like energy probes through 
the ceiling of the cave.

C.U. GUS -- awed

                         GUS
                    It's feeding itself. It wants
                    to live.




EXT. TOP OF GRAND CANYON - DAY

WIDE SHOT: An incredible sight: the crackling red-hot energy probes leap from 
the ground beneath, dart up into the air, and literally hook on to the power 
lines and pylons. The machine is feeding itself right from the source. The very 
power lines themselves glow red-hot from the tremendous zapping of energy taking 
place.               

LONG SHOT: We SEE the energy probes racing along the power lines toward the 
horizon, toward the rest of the nation.

EXT. SKY/SPACE

LOOKING DOWN at EARTHS'S GLOBE as power blackouts begin to hit North America.

EXT. BIG CITY - NIGHT

LOOKING DOWN FROM GREAT DISTANCE as power blackout hits, lights start to go out.

INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING THEATER

An operation is in progress.

                         DOCTOR
                         (quiet, careful)
                    All right, nurse, we're going into
                    the brain now. Be ready with every--

Suddenly, the lights in the operating room flicker and go out.

                         NURSE
                         (in darkness)
                    Oh, God---

INT. CAVE. ULTIMATE COMPUTER

The machine glows with an unearthly energy. Suddenly, the ray of deadly green 
Kryptonite goes on again, hitting SUPERMAN with full force.

ON SUPERMAN -- already weakened from the first bout, he falls to the floor, in 
terrible pain.

ON GUS--from inside the generator area he sees what's happening. He grabs a 
fire-safety axe from its hook and races toward the globe-like part of the 
machine that sends the Kryptonite ray out.

NEW ANGLE -- GUS hacks away at the mechanism. His expression is intense, 
tortured. This is Dr. Frankenstein killing the monster he created, the inventor 
forced to destroy his own invention. With tremendous effort, he chops and slams 
and smashes the offending part of the computer, finally destroying it. Hunks of 
metal drop to the floor. The green ray shuts off.




SUPERMAN struggles to his feet. He looks awful.

GUS, exhausted, stands there by the source of destruction. He's done it. He 
drops the axe. Suddenly:

Sound: A horrible, screeching, electronic noise as:

EFFECTS: The machine, furious, lifts GUS into the air on a beam of energy and 
hurls him full force against the wall of the cave. He crashes into it with 
terrific impact and falls to the ground behind a pile of rock and rubble. From 
the incredible force of the blow, it seems certain that the machine has killed 
him.

A terrible moment of silence. Then SUPERMAN, looking like he's in total despair, 
turns and slinks out of the cave, clutching his left arm.

                         LORELEI
                    No! Don't leave us alone in
                    here! Superman --
                          (but he's gone)

The machine glows and shakes, its energy probes zapping through the rock ceiling 
above.

                         VERA
                    I don't know about you, girly,
                    but I'm getting out of here!

But LORELEI is first on the stairs, as she runs like hell off the machine 
itself. VERA is right behind her. LORELEI gets to the bottom, dashes across the 
"moat" via one of the wedge-shaped grids.

ON ROSS -- coming-to in the interior, by the generator. he picks himself up and 
runs after LORELEI.

A moment later, VERA, coming from the greatest distance, starts to race across 
the moat.
          
EFFECTS: VERA is literally "sucked" back into the machine, dragged across the 
"moat" and pulled into the computer's entrails. As she screams in protest, the 
intense force slams her into a section of the circuitry.

ON VERA: A monstrous transformation begins to take place. VERA becomes part of 
the machine. No longer human. Circuitry appears beneath her skin. Her face pulls 
and distorts into grotesque non-human cubistic form. Charges of electricity and 
power pass into her body, light it up. The effect is very frightening to behold. 
Unearthly sounds come from her throat.

NEW ANGLE -- As LORELEI tries to run from the cave, "VERA'S" linked arm extend 
and a silvery sphere of "magneticism" shoots out like a cannon ball aimed at 
her. Suddenly LORELEI is yanked upwards, stuck fast to the wall of the cave, 
screaming, kicking, unable to free herself.

C.U. VERA -- This is no longer a human face. A hideous arm-like probe extends 
from her forehead and shoots out a hot yellow beam.



NEW ANGLE -- the yellow beam hits ROSS, stopping him in his tracks in front of 
the machine, torturing him.

                         ROSS
                    Sis! No, it's Bubba--
                         (he squirms in
                          pain)
                    
ON THE TOP OF THE COMPUTER -- The energy probes continue to shoot right through 
the ceiling of the cave.

EXT. CANYON. TOP LEDGE (PYLONS) - DAY

The probes continue to feed  on the electrical power supply.

EXT. METROPOLIS - NIGHT

Lights start going off in Metropolis skyscrapers.

INT. SUBWAY TRACK - NIGHT

A subway train is moving down the tunnel TOWARD CAMERA. As it comes CLOSE, we 
SEE LANA and RICKY inside. Suddenly the black-out hits. Lights go out. Train 
stops.

Sound: screaming, panic of the PASSENGERS.

                         RICKY
                          (terrified)
                    Mommy! Mommy!

EXT. IRIQUOIS TRAIL NUCLEAR POWER STATION - NIGHT

LONG SHOT: of the three silos we SAW earlier in the forest fire. Coming from B. 
G. at great speed is a blue blur zooming through the sky: SUPERMAN.

INT. NUCLEAR CHAMBER

The SCIENTISTS in great consternation. ONE looks at an electronic grid map of 
the U,S.A., showing the blackouts coming closer.

                         DR. HARRIS
                    What the hell is causing it?!

                         SCIENTIST
                    Search me. All I know is it 
                    looks like a complete electronic
                    grid-lock. And if it gets to us--

                         DR. HARRIS
                          (grim faced)
                    Which one is the panic button?




INT. CAVE. ULTIMATE COMPUTER - DAY

LOOKING TOWARD THE ENTRANCE: As SUPERMAN, looking a bit bedraggled, returns and 
enters. He holds his left arm behind his back, under his cape, as if  favoring a 
hurt elbow.

REVERSE: WIDE ANGLE SHOWS US WHAT HE, TOO, SEES: The machine glowing brighter 
and brighter; VERA, totally transformed into a robot-like creature, ruthlessly 
training the painful yellow ray on ROSS, who is immobilized and tormented; 
LORELEI still pinned to the wall up high by the magnetic sphere.

                         ROSS
                    Help me...help me....

Immediately, SUPERMAN runs into the area just in front of ROSS so as to fully 
absorb the yellow beam and block it off.

REVERSE FROM BEHIND THEM: A shaken ROSS, relieved at last, crawls away into the 
shadows of the cavern.

WIDE ANGLE -- This yellow beam has no effect on SUPERMAN. But just as VERA 
terminates it, two enormous arms of the machine, like giant pinball flippers, 
begin to slide across the cave floor, about to close in and pin SUPERMAN.

These two transformer arms trap him and raises him slightly off the ground, 
pulling him forward in a direct line toward the moat, until:

CLOSER -- He is deposited on the very transparent wedge where VERA stood when 
she was sucked into the machine. And now, to our horror, the same thing happens 
to him. Although he seems to be trying to resist the incredible "pull," SUPERMAN 
is drawn across the moat and into the very bowels of the giant computer. He is 
pulled, as if by a giant suctioning force, past VERA and down into the center of 
the apparatus, where the generator is.

For a terrible moment, all seems lost. Then, he is SEEN deep in there, as he 
reveals what he had hidden in his left hand, behind his cape.

CLOSER -- It's a silver canister, about two feet long, cylindrical in shape. He 
unscrews the lid.

EFFECTS: Immediately an incredible red glow bursts from the canister, so strong 
we almost need to shield our eyes. WE RECOGNIZE IT, FROM ITS COLOR AND 
INTENSITY, IMMEDIATELY" It is the nuclear core he stabilized at Iroquois Trail 
Power Plant.

                         SUPERMAN
                    You're Hungry for energy?
                    Taste this.

He drops the nuclear core in the center of the machine.

LONG SHOT: The giant computer begins to glow even more brightly than before. 
Red-hot, then white hot, then it begins to crackle and rumble and smoke. The 
machine is overdosing.



EFFECTS: IN SPECTACULAR SERIES OF SHOTS, the machine self-destructs. Explosions. 
Burn-outs. Short circuits. Flare-ups. Entire chunks of metal hurled into the 
air. Tremendous noise. It's like watching the end of the world as we WATCH the 
machine commit suicide.

IN THE MIDST OF THIS, INTERCUT SHOT OF LORELEI, released from her magnetic trap, 
sliding down the cave wall and landing unceremoniously (and unconsciously) on 
the ground.

At last there is a gigantic explosion within the computer. It totally 
disintegrates, bursting apart from its own gluttony, wreaking havoc and total 
destruction within the cave.

A long moment as the dust settles. No sign of life. Piles of rubble and broken 
rock everywhere. It looks like a bombed-out battlefield. And then...

ON A MOUND OF EARTH AND DEBRIS -- The hand of a white man struggles up and out 
from beneath the pile of rock.

PAN SLIGHTLY LEFT: From an adjacent mound of rubble, the hand of a black man is 
seen pushing out from beneath the earth.

And SUPERMAN and GUS clasp hands and pull each other out from beneath the 
mounds.

They struggle up and out, clutching their hands together: alive, triumphant, and 
partners at last.

EXT. OIL FIELDS - DAY

ON THE FOREMAN.  Looking in quiet despair at his non-working acres of derricks. 
Shrugging, he turns and starts walking away when:

Sound: the thunk of a motor starting, a pump beginning to work.

He spins around in wonder and sees the pump nearest him suddenly coming to life 
again.

Seconds later, another one starts up. Then another. Then five more.

EXT. PIPELINE, DESERT OR TUNDRA - DAY

Oil starts gushing out the formerly dry valve-faucet. The delighted WORKER 
rushes to turn it off.

EXT. OCEAN - DAY

AERIAL SHOT. The tankers begin to move away from each other in different 
directions.

EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY

A car pulls up to the gas pumps. STATION ATTENDANT comes over to the car.

                         ATTENDANT
                    Regular or premium?



                         MAN IN CAR
                    What the hell, she hasn't had a
                    drink in so long, let's give her
                    a tankful of the good stuff.

The ATTENDANT starts to pump gas in the car.

EXT. SKY - DAY

SUPERMAN flying with GUS clinging to his outstretched arms, his legs wrapped 
around his waist. Sort of like the stork flying his bundle. GUS is absolutely 
terrified. He opens one eye, looks down, quickly shuts it.

                         SUPERMAN
                    How you doing down there?

                         GUS
                    Don't make me talk, please.
                    I got enough problems just
                    hangin' on.

                         SUPERMAN
                         (a little laugh)
                    Hey, you're perfectly safe.

                         GUS
                    I ain't about to argue with you.
                          (as they fly)
                    What's gonna happen to them
                    three? Ross the boss and those 
ladies?

     SUPERMAN
That's up to the judge, Gus.
It's not your problem anymore.

     GUS
       (suddenly)
Watch out for them air pockets!

     SUPERMAN
No, we're just going down.

     GUS
    (terrified)
We gonna crash?

     SUPERMAN
I never crash, Gus. That'd be
embarrassing.

     GUS
      (eyes shut)
We back in Metropolis?

     SUPERMAN
No...I just have a little stop
to make.

ANGLE DOWN: Beneath them is a coal mine in West Virginia or similar place.

EXT. COAL MINE - DAY

A big mound of coal sits on the ground near a shack and a mine entrance. A FEW 
MINERS look up in amazement as SUPERMAN and GUS land.

                         GUS
                        (looking around)
                    Whatcha wanna stop here for?
                         (quickly)
                    Not that I ain't glad to be on the 
ground, y'understand.

     SUPERMAN
Just a second.

He walks over to the miners, and picks up a lump of coal.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Can you guys spare this one?

                         A MINER
                        (having trouble finding
                          his voice)
                    ...Sure, Superman.
                          (incredulously)
                    It is Superman, isn't it?

                         GUS
                        (lording it over
                          them)
                    Hey, man, who'dya think it
                    was, your mama?

ON SUPERMAN -- he turns away, his back to them all.

EFFECTS: CLOSER ON HIS HANDS as he squeezes the lump of coal. The incredible 
pressure of super-strength does what it takes nature centuries to do: before our 
eyes the lump of coal turns into a Liz Taylor-size diamond, glinting in the 
light.

                         SUPERMAN
                         (to himself)
                    Too showy.

EFFECTS: He squeezes it further down to a normal-size diamond.





Holding it in his fist, he turns back to them.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Thanks.
                           (to GUS)
                    Let's go

                         GUS
                    I was afraid you'd say that.
                          (to MINERS)
                    Hey, is there a bus station
                    around here?

                         SUPERMAN
                          (with a laugh)
                    Suit yourself, Gus.
                           (to the MINERS)
                    Say, does your boss use a 
                    computer in this operation?

                         FIRST MINER
                    Yeah, a small one. Why?

                         SUPERMAN
                    You tell him he can do a lot worse
                    than giving Gus Gorman here a
                    job. Tell him I guarantee it.

He smiles farewell and takes off.

HOLD ON GUS -- watching him fly away.

                         GUS
                          (softly)
                    Take it easy, man.

He turns to the awe0struck MINERS.

                         FIRST MINER
                    You flew with him?

In a gesture of bravado, Gus unsnaps the buttons on his shirt front, as if to 
reveal a Super-Gus outfit. But, of course, there's just an old T-shirt there. So 
he quickly adopts a big-shot tone:

                         GUS
                    So, You fellas ain't never
                    seen the super dude before, 
                    huh? Him and me, we go way 
back. I mean way back. We 
generally help each other out,
y'see, like just yesterday was
in this cave, see...

And he starts to spin his yarn to the wide-eyed AUDIENCE:
INT/EXT FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

ON SUPERMAN -- smiling affably.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Hi. I reserved a table for two.

REVERSE: A VERY ELEGANT MAITRE D' is at the restaurant desk  of a very toney 
French restaurant, all red velvet and fake Matisse paintings. He is regarding 
SUPERMAN with great disdain.

                         MAITRE D'
                    I'm sorry, but we won't be able
                    to seat you.

TWO SHOT

                         SUPERMAN
                          (the smile fading)
                    I know I'm a little early but --

                         MAITRE D'
                    We won't be able to seat you
                    later either.
                            (pointedly)
                    Gentlemen are required to 
                    wear jacket and tie.

                         SUPERMAN
                          (nonplussed)
                    Oh.
                           (to himself)
                    I'd better try to catch her before 
she leaves.

INT. CORRIDOR, METROPOLIS HOTEL - NIGHT

This is that clean, nicely furnished, moderately-priced family hotel we all wish 
really existed.

ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS -- as they open and CLARK emerges, straightening his tie.

FOLLOW HIM as he hurries down the corridor, past the Room Service trolley beside 
the door of room 311. He knocks on the door. A very spiffily dressed LANA opens 
it.

                         LANA
                    Clark! What a nice surprise!
                    Come on in.

INT. METROPOLIS HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

RICKY is sitting at a little table/desk, enjoying the Room Service supper that 
was brought up on that trolley outside.

The room is small, a bit cramped, what with a folding cot that has been moved in 
for RICKY, plus a chair, table, LANA'S bed, etc.

                         RICKY
                    Hi. Mister Kent.
                         (as CLARK smiles
                          back, RICKY can't
                           help bragging:)
                    Guess who Mom's having dinner 
with tonight? Superman!

     CLARK
       (apologetically, 
         to LANA)
Actually, that's why I stopped
by. He's realy sorry, he wanted 
to make it, but then he...ran into
a problem.

LANA looks a little disappointed, but less so than RICKY.

                         LANA
                          (nodding understandingly)
                    I guess he misses a lot of dinners.

                         CLARK
                    But if you wouldn't mind
                    settling for me --

                         LANA
                          (brightening)
                    Anyday...

TWO-SHOT -- CLARK and LANA

                         CLARK
                    He asked me to give you
                    something. You know, he 
                    and I, we talk all the time. 
                    And when he heard about 
                    you having to pawn your 
diamond ring, he thought 
that was terrible.
        (awkwardly)
So when he found this sort
of, um, lying around -- well,
he thought you might like to 
have it.

He takes from his breast pocket a little ring set with the diamond SUPERMAN 
squeezed out of coal. He lays it in her hand.




MED. C.U. LANA -- She just stares at it as if she can't believe this is 
happening. When she looks up at CLARK, her eyes are very large and a little 
moist.

                         LANA
                    I...I...

But she is too moved for wards. Finally, she can only throw her arms around 
CLARK and hig him with all her might and all her heart. Which he doesn't mind a 
bit.

INT. CORRIDOR, METROPOLIS HOTEL - NIGHT

ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS -- as they open. This time it is BRAD who steps -- or 
stumbles -- out, holding forth his new best friends, the TWO SINISTER TYPES (one 
with scar and eyepatch, one with shved head and mustache) we SAW  earlier in the 
bar with (EVIL) SUPERMAN.

                         BRAD
                    Wait till you see her.
                          (waxing poetic)
                    Hair like a sunset, eyes like
                    stars, and built like a --

                         GUY WITH EYEPATCH
                           (overlapping, scornfully)
                    A chick like that, what's she want
                    with you?

                         BRAD
                    She's my girl. I came all the way
                    from Smallville just to bring her
                    back.
                           (with great assurance)
                    She's crazy about me -- she just
                    don't know it yet.

They lurch down the corridor, peering at room numbers.

INT. METROPOLIS HOTEL ROM - NIGHT

Slipping the ring on her finger, LANA studies its gleam in the lamplight and 
glows with pleasure herself.

                         RICKY
                        (his own perspective)
                    Wow, a ring form Superman!
                    Lemme see, Mom!

He jumps up, knocking a dish of hard candies off the table. They scatter on the 
carpet. RICKY looks dismayed, but CLARK is, as always, ready to help.

                         CLARK
                          (quickly)
                    Here, I'll get those.

He kneels to pick up the candies.
                         LANA
                            (still in the throes 
          of emotion)
I really don't know what to say.
       (as CLARK smiles up
         at her, she almost
          blushes)
Thank you. I mean, thank him--      

WIDE ANGLE -- It is at just this moment that BRAD and his boozing buddies burst 
in to see "his girl" sporting a diamond ring on her outstretched hand and 
looking soulfully down at CLARK KENT, who is  down on one knee, gazing up at 
her. To BRAD it all means one thing:

                         BRAD
                    Wha----you sonofa----

                         LANA
                    Brad!

BRAD charges into the room like a bull, his two BUDDIES (brawlers by nature) 
right behind him. (NOTE: CLARK'S dilema in this fight is that he must retain the 
CLARK KENT identity, i.e. not only can he not use super-powers, he can't even 
hit anybody since it would be lethal. Therefore, his strategy is to look clumsy 
and awkward, while actually manipulating the defeat of the three bullies. What 
follows is very quick:)

BRAD, drunk, takes a swing at CLARK and misses; his momentum sends him falling 
forward over the room's chair.

                         CLARK
                    whoops----

The BALD GUY throws a tale lamp at CLARK, who ducks in time. As LANA and RICKY 
try to get out of the way, the BALD GUY charges CLARK before CLARK can get to an 
upright position. Thus CLARK comes up just in time to "accidentally" butt his 
attacker in the gut. The BALD GUY sails right into the open closet, smashing his 
skull against the inside wall. Out cold, he slides to the floor. Quickly, LANA 
runs over and shuts the closet door on him, as if to say, "That's that."

The GUY WITH THE EYPATCH is enraged:

CLARK puts his hands up, as if backing away:

                         CLARK
                    Take it easy now, c'mon, be
                    reasonable.

INSERT: CLARK kicks the fallen lamp at the GUY'S feet.

THE GUY WITH THE EYEPATCH steps on th lamp, trips, falls forward full force on 
the folding cot, which promptly folds itself up, both sides, squashing and 
imprisoning him inside the mattress. in effect, the GUY is filling in a sandwich 
completely immobilized.



ON BRAD: Who picks himself up, glares drunkenly at CLARK, practicaly pawing the 
grounf as he speaks:

                         BRAD
                    Kent, I hate you. I always hated
                    you. And you know why, Kent?
                    Because you're nice. Nice guys
                    finish----

And before he can utter the word "last," he's overcome with rage. He puts down 
his head, roars like an animal, and charges at CLARK like a bull at a toreador.

CLARK goes to pick up the glass candy dish, shich is in BRAD'S hand. BRAD 
catapaults over him and goes right out the open door, lands splat on top of the 
Room Service trolley in the hallway.

INT. CORRIDOR, METROPOLIS HOTEL - NIGHT

Causing the trolley, with BRAD spread-eagled on top of it, to head right for the 
elevator. Just as we think it's going to crash, the elevator doors open and 
BRAD, trolley and all, roll right into the elevator where a DIGNIFIED COUPLE 
stand.

INT. ELEVATOR

The WOMAN looks down with distaste at the drunken and battered BRAD laying on 
top of the food on the serving tray.

                         WOMAN
                    No wonder they sent it back.

Her husband nods.

INT. DAILY PLANET, PERRY WHITE'S OFFICE - DAY

PERRY is at his desk. LOIS is sitting facing him, looking trim and tan and 
terrific. CLARK is beside her.

                         PERRY
                    Lois, I've got to hand it to you.
                    You're amazing. Who else could
                    manage to turn a three-week 
                    tropical vacation into a front page
                    story that's going to blow the lid
                    off government corruption in the 
                    Caribbean?

                         LOIS
                    I just knew I was onto something
                    when that taxi driver kidnapped me.

                         CLARK
                         (repressing a tiny,
                          fond smile)
                    You're the best, Lois.

                         LOIS
                    I'd better be. Suddenly I've got
                    competition to keep up with.
                         (as CLARK looks     
                          confused)
                    Your high school reunion article.
                    I though it was terrific. And
                    fascinating.
                         (shyly curious)
                    Especially about the girl back
                    home.
                         (expansively)
                    I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll 
                    take you to lunch and you can
                    tell me all about it.

                         CLARK
                    Gee, I'm sorry, Lois. But I've
                    already got a lunch date. With 
                    Mr. White's new secretary.

                         LOIS
                         (intrigued)
                    Oh?

NEW ANGLE -- The office door opens and LANA LANG, looking very perky, sticks her 
head in.

                         LANA
                         (softly, as she puts
                          some papers on 
                            PERRY'S desk)
                    Hi. Clark.

                         PERRY
                    Lois, met Lana Lang. Smallville's
                    latest gift to Metropolis.

                         LOIS
                          (more intrigued, taking
                           a closer look at her now)
                    Oh??

                         LANA
                    Glad to meet you, Miss Lane.
                    I like your writing a lot.

                         LOIS
                    Thanks.
                         (shaking the hand, LANA
                          has offered, LOIS can't
                          help noticing the ring on
                          her other hand; lightly)
                    I like your sparkler a lot.

                         LANA
                           (confiding, happily)
                    Me too. I couldn't believe it 
                    when Clark gave it to me.

                         LOIS
                           (she can't believe 
                             it either)     
                    Clark gave you -- ???

She can't finish the sentence. But she doesn't get a chance to, anyway.

From off-screen, the not-so dulcet tones of MISS HENDERSON:

                         MISS HENDERSON
                    Mr. White, look what I've got for
                    you.

ON MISS HENDERSON -- pushing before her a new bingo machine -- the electronic 
kind that has jets of air pushing the plastic balls inside a dome like popcorn 
maker. The JINGO sign is attached.

                         MISS HENDERSON
                         (terribly thrilled)
                    It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's
                    state-of-the art.
                           (to all)
                    People, I am in love with this
                    machine.
                            (she pushes it in
                            front of PERRY)
                    Go ahead, Mr. White.

                         PERRY
                           (already miserable)
                    Where's the handle?

                         MISS HENDERSON
                          (giggling)
                    There is no handle! You just push
                    a button.

She shows him the button. He punches it. The machine activates. The plastic 
balls begin to jump and leap inside the dome. then it starts going faster. 
Faster. Smoke starts to curl from the machine.

Sound: An awful grinding noise.

                         LOIS
                    What's that terrible smell?

ON THE MACHINE -- it self-destructs, firing JINGO balls all over the office, 
exploding its plastic dome.


FULL SHOT -- as ALL stand there, stunned.

                         CLARK
                          (backing out of
                          the room)
                    Uh...excuse me, folks...

                         PERRY
                    Kent!

                         CLARK
                    I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've
                    got an errand to run.

EXT. SKY ABOVE PISA - DAY

ON SUPERMAN as he flies. 
                                                             
                         SUPERMAN
                          (shamefaced, to himself)
                         Gosh, what an awful thing to have
done.

He starts to descend.

WIDE SHOT: He arrives at the top of the tower, starts to push it back down again 
so that it will lean once more.

EXT.  SOUVENIR STAND, PISA - DUSK

Where our MAN once again admires his stock of vertical Tower models, looks to 
the real thing, looks back and then does a double-take worthy of Billy Gilbert 
in his prime: for the Tower is now the LEANING TOWER again and all his wares are 
useless.

Hysterical, he smashes shelves tot he ground,  makes violent obscene gestures at 
the caped HERO above, weeping and screaming.

                         SHOPKEEPER
                            Cretino!   Stronzo!
                        (and other expletives deleted)

EXT. SKY/SPACE

All problems attended to, he flies majestically across the magical place where 
light blue sky deepens into the dark black of outer space. As HE FLIES TO 
CAMERA, he shrugs as if to say, "Well, you can't win 'em all, folks." Then 
there's the comforting, familiar, warm smile and the little salute that lets us 
know the world is safe in the hands of the one, the only...SUPERMAN!


                         THE    END
