          FADE IN:

          1 NEW YORK CITY - PARK AVENUE - NIGHT - 1982 1
          A TAXI pulls over to a curb where an ELDERLY MAN waits with
          his MIDDLE-AGED SON in THE RAIN.

          MIDDLE-AGED SON
          (as they climb in)
          23rd and Lex.
          The CABBIE grunts a reply.

          MIDDLE-AGED SON (CONT'D)
          How ya doin', Papa, you doin'
          alright?

          ELDERLY MAN
          Fine, fine...

          MIDDLE-AGED SON
          This is just a check-up, okay?
          Doctor Katz says you'll outlive us
          all.
          (looks out the window)
          Traffic isn't bad. We should be
          back in time to watch the Mets.
          He notices his father is STARING, wide-eyed, at the cabby's
          HACK LICENSE. We glimpse only the last name..."Bielski."

          MIDDLE-AGED SON (CONT'D)
          Papa? .Papa, what is it?
          IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR, the old man catches the furtive
          eyes of the cabby.

          ELDERLY MAN
          ...You. Can it be?
          The eyes in the mirror look away. And then back.

          ELDERLY MAN (CONT'D)
          Bielski. Can it possibly be?
          As we PUSH IN on the eyes in the mirror, we HEAR THE

          DESPERATE RASPING SOUND OF PANTING.

          CUT TO:

          2 A MAN RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE THROUGH THE WOODS. 2
          Bombs EXPLODE all around as he passes dead bodies and BURNT-
          OUT VEHICLES. Without slowing he discards a WW II Red Army
          helmet, a field jacket, a heavy pack, anything that might
          impede his flight. He glances back up over his shoulder.
          The sky is filled with BOMBERS. He runs on.

          4 THE VILLAGE OF NALIBOKI 4
          A typical Eastern European shtetl. LOCAL POLICE help German
          Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing squads, round up Jews.
          PEASANTS beat them with sticks as they are herded into lines.
          One man tries to run and is beaten.
          Others look on, or look away with indifference as they are
          loaded onto waiting trucks.

          5 TWO MEN HIDE IN THE NEARBY WOODS (ZUS & ASAEL BIELSKI) 5
          We study their faces: a turbulent portrait of impotent rage,
          terrible fear, overwhelming grief, and secret relief.

          ASAEL
          Where are they taking them?

          ZUS
          --Shveig! Shveig!

          ASAEL

          BUT--

          ZUS
          Just shut up! Please...

          6 AN ALLEY WAY IN NOVAGRUDOK 6
          The man we last saw in flight (TUVIA BIELSKI) wearing the
          remnants of his uniform, slips down a cobble-stoned street.
          He ducks into a doorway as A PATROL passes by.

          6A A REMOTE FARM 6A
          Zus and Asael move warily through a barnyard. A tethered
          dog BARKS furiously. A farmer challenges them.

          WALENCKI
          (in Russian; subtitles)

          WHAT DO YOU WANT?
          Walencki brandishes a pitchfork.

          ASAEL
          (in Russian; subtitles)
          Some food...?

          WALENCKI
          They are looking for you people.
          The two brothers glance nervously around.

          WALENCKI (CONT'D)
          Get away from here! GO!
          ZUS, the older of the two brothers, takes a menacing step
          toward the farmer but his younger brother holds him back.

          ASAEL
          Zus. Let's go.
          As they retreat toward the woods, Zus warns the farmer.

          ZUS
          We'll be back.

          7 A BOURGEOIS APARTMENT -- DAY 7
          Tuvia is getting dressed as AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN -- his wife,
          RIFKA -- stands by the window, smoking a cigarette.

          TUVIA
          And no news of my brothers?

          RIFKA
          They are used to trouble, they'll
          be all right.

          TUVIA
          If you stay, you'll have to go to
          the ghetto.

          RIFKA
          I can get false papers and pass as
          a gentile. So can you.
          Tuvia shakes his head, no. He finishes dressing. Theirs
          is a relationship long past passion.

          RIFKA (CONT'D)
          Will you at least stay tonight?

          TUVIA
          I need to see to my family. Will
          you come?

          RIFKA
          To the country? No.

          8 A MODEST MILL - LATER THAT DAY 8
          A PAIR OF LEGS lie motionless behind a trough. Beyond, A
          MAN'S TORSO. Zus and Asael stare in mute horror.

          ASAEL
          Papa-- Gottenyu...
          Flies buzz about dead LIVESTOCK. A WOMAN'S BODY lies nearby.

          9 IN THE HOUSE 9
          A still portrait of a life interrupted.

          9 CONTINUED: 9
          A table set for dinner. Candles lit. An open book. A
          NOISE from a cupboard. Zus grabs a hatchet.
          From the root cellar, a YOUNG BOY, 14, appears. His face
          is dirty and tear-streaked. They go to embrace him.

          ASAEL
          Aron.
          The boy (ARON) recoils. He is disoriented and WILL NOT

          SPEAK.

          9A EXT. MODEST MILL - MOMENTS LATER 9A

          Loaded down with possessions, Asael hurries back to the
          woods. Zus pauses long enough to pry the mezuzah from the
          door.

          CUT TO:

          10 THE FOREST AT DUSK 10
          Aron stares mutely straight ahead. Asael is shaking
          uncontrollably and crying. Zus is at a loss what to do.

          ZUS
          Stop it...
          But Asael is lost in a confusion of grief and panic.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Stop it. STOP IT!
          Finally Zus grabs him in a gesture halfway between violence
          and comfort...and holds him as Asael rocks back and forth.

          CUT TO:

          11 THE NALIBOKI FOREST AT DAWN - VIEWED FROM ABOVE 11
          A million acres of dense, impenetrable woods and swamps.

          12 ASAEL AND ARON SLEEP HUDDLED ON THE GROUND 12
          The sound of a FOOTSTEP. They sit up in terror.

          TUVIA
          If I was a German you are dead.

          ASAEL
          Tuvia!
          Asael leaps up to embrace him as if he were salvation itself.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          Papa and Mama. They killed them.

          Asael clings to him. Even Aron allows himself to be held.
          Tuvia hold them silently. Zus appears, hatchet in hand.

          ZUS
          Big brother returns.
          Tuvia and Zus look at each other warily.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          You saw them?
          Yes. Tuvia saw them. Zus takes the mezuzah from his pocket,
          tosses it to Tuvia.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Welcome home.

          13 LATER - THE NALIBOCKI FOREST - A LOAF OF STALE BREAD 13
          is torn apart by filthy hands as they move through the trees.

          ASAEL
          Are you going back to the army?

          TUVIA
          There is no more army.
          Asael worships his big brother.

          ZUS
          Hope at least you killed a few.
          Tuvia just stares at him.

          ASAEL
          What is it like? To be in a war?

          TUVIA
          It wasn't war. It was something
          else.
          Zus eyes him carefully.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Where is Sonia and the baby?

          ZUS
          Horodysze. Hiding in a cellar.
          I'll bring her when it is safe.
          Where is Rifka?

          TUVIA
          In Novgrudok. She wouldn't leave.

          ZUS
          You are still separated?

          TUVIA
          She is still my wife.

          ZUS
          Your rich wife.
          Zus chews with the open-mouthed relish of a peasant.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          So why exactly have you come back?
          Tuvia just stares at him. The reason is obvious as he holds
          his younger brothers.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          You have a plan?

          TUVIA
          No. Do you?

          Shivering and miserable, they are trying to start a fire.
          Asael's few remaining matches are sodden.

          TUVIA
          Is there anything left to eat?
          Only a few potatoes in Asael's bag. WORMS writhe among
          them.

          ASAEL
          Zus finished the last of the sausage.
          Tuvia glares at Zus, who glares back. Sibling rivals.

          ZUS
          Stankowicz' farm is closest.

          ASAEL
          He has dogs.

          ZUS
          Fuck the dogs. Wilencki then.

          TUVIA
          You think Wilencki is going to give
          us food?

          ZUS
          No. We take it.

          And he tells the police.

          ZUS
          I have run from the police my whole
          life. Do you really think it's a
          good time to stop?
          A moment of decision. Who holds the balance of power?

          ASAEL
          We know these woods. They'll never
          find us in here.
           Tuvia looks at his brothers. He has been outvoted.

          15 THE SMALL FARMHOUSE 15
          where Zus and Asael first tried to get food. Asael waits
          outside, anxiously on guard.

          16 INSIDE 16
          The farmer (WALENCKI) who threatened them with the pitchfork
          sits eating a simple dinner.
          Zus and Tuvia burst in. Zus brandishes a hoe.

          ZUS
          (in Russian; subtitles)
          We want food. Be quick about it!

          WALENCKI

          NOW!

          WALENCKI
          Sure, sure. Take what you want...
          Tuvia begins to stuff provisions into a sack.

          ZUS
          Where is your gun, farmer?

          WALENCKI
          I have no gun.
          Zus grabs a dinner plate and SMASHES IT IN THE FARMER'S

          FACE.

          ZUS

          WHERE IS YOUR GUN?
          Holding his bloody face, the farmer cowers in fear.

          He's lying.
          He kicks him again. The farmer begins to weep.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          You're lying!
          Zus dumps the remains of the farmer's dinner onto him.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          If I hit you once more, you will
          shit your pants. Twice and you
          will never shit again.
          The farmer knows Zus won't hesitate.

          WALENCKI
          Up there...
          Zus kicks the man aside. Above the stove is an old rifle.
          Zus grabs it, points it at the farmer.

          18 ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST 18
          Aron has been left alone. He holds a STICK which he "shoots"
          like a gun -- kachew -- as he creeps from tree to tree.
          Aron freezes. SOMETHING is moving in the trees. He
          crouches. A dark blur. An animal? It moves off. He follows.
          The shape appears again. It's a SMALL GIRL, roughly Aron's
          age. Aron waves at her. The girl stares, then runs off.
          Aron hurries after her into a wooded grove, then stops short.

          A PILE OF NAKED CORPSES.
          Overflows a newly-dug trench. The small girl runs to A
          MIDDLE-AGED MAN with a crude Star-of-David sewn to his
          tattered coat. He holds an OLDER GIRL, 14, in his arms.
          Nearby, three or four OTHERS emerge from hiding. Starved,
          in tatters, the living waiting to die.

          You know what Papa would do when
          you did that at table...

          Tuvia imitates his father's criticism of Zus. Asael laughs.
          Zus can't help but laugh as well. Even in grief there is
          laughter. A glimpse of ties that bind them.

          ASAEL
          I can't believe Papa's dead.

          ZUS
          Bernicki.

          ASAEL
          The police captain?

          TUVIA
          We don't know he did it.

          ZUS
          He always had it in for Papa.

          TUVIA
          We don't know he did it.

          ZUS
          So we will go and ask him if he
          did.

          ASAEL
          Koscik has a pistol. He showed it
          to me once.

          ZUS
          One pistol isn't enough. We need
          rifles. Machine guns.

          TUVIA
          Machine guns? You're going to take
          on the whole German army?

          Just because you didn't...
          The SOUND of footsteps. Zus jumps up cocking the rifle.
          ARON emerges from the trees. And then, behind him, THE
          SURVIVORS he discovered among the corpses.
          THE MIDDLE-AGED MAN holds a teenage GIRL by one hand and
          carries his younger daughter.

          MIDDLE-AGED MAN
          The child is hurt.
          The brothers stare at him. Wary and unwelcoming.

          TUVIA
          Set her down.
          The man lowers the child to the ground. She isn't moving.

          He cannot bring himself to say the words. OTHERS shuffle
          forward, still in shock, barely able to speak their gratitude
          as Tuvia offers chunks of bread and cheese. The man tries
          to feed his daughter. She is barely alive.
          Asael turns to Aron. Gently.

          ASAEL
          Where did you find them?
          Aron still won't speak. Asael addresses the other girl.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          Your sister is sick?

          LITTLE GIRL (RACHEL)
          They kept her for a week.
          We fill in the rest.

          ZUS (O.S.)

          TUVIA--
          Zus has moved out of earshot. Tuvia joins him.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          We cannot feed them.

          TUVIA
          I'll go ask Koscik for food.

          ZUS
          And the pistol.

          TUVIA
          And the pistol.
          Without another word, he starts off.

          ZUS
           Remember to say please.

          TUVIA
          I cannot thank you enough.
          They sit in Koscik's warmly-lit kitchen. Koscik's WIFE
          stands silently by the stove, glaring at Tuvia.

          KOSCIK
          Your father was a good man.

          TUVIA
          He said the same of you.
          Tuvia can't help but notice Koscik's wife giving him the
          evil eye. Koscik produces a bottle of vodka.

          KOSCIK
          Ignore the bitch.
          (raising the bottle)
          To the dead. God rest their souls.
          (in Russian; subtitles)
          Bitch-- Do you want vodka?
          His wife just glares at him.

          KOSCIK (CONT'D)
          I live with this, can you imagine?
          HEADLIGHTS sweep over the window. A CAR is fast approaching.

          KOSCIK (CONT'D)
           Hide yourself. ...The barn.

          21 TUVIA HURRIES ACROSS THE COURTYARD AND INTO THE BARN. 21

          22 IN THE LOFT 22
          He climbs a ladder and is startled to find FIVE MORE MEN
          AND WOMEN in hiding. They stare in mute terror.

          23 OUTSIDE THE BARN 23
          Koscik greets A BELARUSSIAN POLICE CAPTAIN and his SONS as
          they exit the car. They speak in Russian, with subtitles:

          KOSCIK
          Working late, boys.

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          Hunting Jews. Our new bosses are
          very organized.
          Koscik offers the bottle.

          KOSCIK
          Hunting can work up a thirst.

          Fifteen in one day. The council is
          offering a year's free tax for every
          one you turn in. -

          KOSCIK
          A Jew is worth that much? Do you
          pay more for a fat one?
          They laugh appreciatively.

          24 IN THE LOFT 24
          A man COUGHS then shrugs an apology. Tuvia glares at him.

          25 BACK TO THE COURTYARD 25

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          Caught five of them hiding in a
          ditch. Smelled so bad I was afraid
          the Germans wouldn't want them.

          KOSCIK
          Maybe for a reduced price.
          More laughter. More vodka.

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          You know the Bielski's?

          KOSCIK
          Sure.

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          We missed two when we visited the
          parents.

          26 IN THE LOFT 26
          Tuvia listens to this casual talk of his parent's death.

          27 BACK IN THE COURTYARD 27

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          Anybody caught helping them is in
          for it. You know this, Koscik?

          KOSCIK
          Do I look like an idiot? Don't
          answer so quickly...
          More laughter. The Police Captain looks at his watch.
          Yawns.

          Been at it since dawn. The wife
          doesn't like these long nights.
          He tries to hand back the bottle to Koscik.

          KOSCIK
          Keep it.

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          Bribing an officer of the law?
          Maybe you have more of this black
          market vodka hidden in the barn?

          KOSCIK
          Take a look. And clean out the cow
          shit while you're back there.
          The policeman laughs and climbs back into the car.

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          You'll keep your eyes open, yes?

          KOSCIK
          Good hunting.

          28 MOMENTS LATER - IN THE BARN 28
          Koscik and Tuvia speak in harsh whispers.

          KOSCIK
          --If the laborers find them tomorrow,
          I will be denounced--

          TUVIA
          What am I supposed to do with--

          KOSCIK
          Take them into the forest--

          TUVIA
          --And feed them how? I can't care
          for my own family.
          Behind them, several of the REFUGEES have emerged from their
          hiding place. They stare at Tuvia balefully.

          29 MOMENTS LATER - BY THE ROADSIDE 29
          The refugees are loaded with provisions. A young man, PINCHAS
          ZUCKERMAN, has a tethered GOAT. Another man carries a violin
          case. Koscik hands Tuvia another bottle of vodka.

          TUVIA
          Those men? They were the ones who
          killed my parents?

          Koscik doesn't want to tell him. Finally he nods, yes.

          KOSCIK
          You people. Why is it so fucking
          hard to be friends with a Jew?
          They embrace.

          TUVIA
          Imagine being one.

          Tuvia just looks at him.

          OLD MAN (CONT'D)
          In school. I am Shimon H'aretz.

          TUVIA
          I thought you were dead.

          SHIMON
          I am at least half-dead.
          (after a moment)
          I heard them speaking of your
          parents. I am very sorry.
          Tuvia shakes his head.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          And the other brothers? What was
          his name, the wild one?

          TUVIA
          Zus. He's with the other two.

          SHIMON
          You are hiding here? In the forest?
          Tuvia nods.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          There has been trouble before maybe?
          With the police?

          So now you go to the forest. A
          wise choice.

          TUVIA
          For a dumb schoolboy, you mean.

          SHIMON
          My whole life I presumed to teach
          others the right way to live. I
          had no doubt: this is God's way,
          this isn't. You'll forgive me if
          recent events have somewhat shaken
          my resolve.

          TUVIA
          It is just like school, I don't
          know what you're talking about.

          in the ashes. Everyone shares from the soup pot. There
          aren't enough spoons to go around.
          Shimon offers Aron something to eat.

          SHIMON
          Here... You're not hungry?
          Aron doesn't respond.

          TUVIA, MEANWHILE
          stares fixedly as Avram digs his daughter's grave. The gun
          is still in his belt. Zus is constructing a shelter.

          ZUS
          I send you for food and you bring
          more mouths to feed.

          TUVIA

          Then we'll have to make them count.
          Zus heads for the food. Asael is trying to start a fire
          but the kindling is wet.

          SHIMON
          Here...
          Shimon takes a book from his coat, rips out pages covered
          in Hebrew and crumples them into the fire. They burst into
          flame.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          The Psalms have many uses.

          ZUS SITS AMONG THE NEWCOMERS
          watching as they eat hungrily.
          Tuvia stops near Avram DIGGING a grave before heading out
          of the camp. We realize Avram's daughter has died while
          Tuvia was away. THE SOUND OF DISTANT THUNDER.

          34 INSIDE THE HOUSE 34
          The POLICE CAPTAIN we saw earlier eats dinner with his WIFE
          and TWO SONS. They speak in Russian.

          WIFE
          You worked late.
          The man nods, his mouth full of food.

          WIFE (CONT'D)
          Tomorrow is Sunday. You have a day
          off, yes?

          POLICE CAPTAIN

          Tuvia stands on the threshold, dripping wet, a spectral
          figure. He holds the pistol at his side.

          TUVIA
          You know who I am?
          The policeman says nothing. His wife is instantly terrified.
          One of the SONS stands. Tuvia turns the gun on him.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Sit.
          The son obeys. The SOUND of the rain on the tin roof is
          deafening. Tuvia turns back to the Police Captain.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          And you know why I am here.

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          ...what are you talking about?

          TUVIA
          You have no idea what I'm talking
          about...

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          If they say find someone, I find
          him. It's my job.

          TUVIA
          To find Jews.

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          Or lose my job.

          TUVIA
          And it's a good job, isn't it? You
          like your job.

          POLICEMAN
          I was always fair with your family.
          ...Everyone knew you were smuggling
          this and that. But I looked the
          other way.

          One of the man's SONS makes a move toward Tuvia. Tuvia
          SHOOTS him in the chest. His mother SCREAMS. The Policeman
          suddenly starts to stand. Tuvia backs away, shoots him.

          Tuvia should indeed kill her, too. To avoid being

          Zus awakens, sodden and stiff. He looks at the group, now
          numbering fourteen. People sleep huddled together: Asael
          holds Aron; Avram keeps his surviving daughter close.
          And there is Tuvia -- sitting by the fire. Zus takes the
          pistol from Tuvia's belt. Checks the cylinder.

          stumbling into camp behind Tuvia, who carries a heavy sack
          of provisions. Zus gives Tuvia a look.

          TUVIA
          I know. I know... Tamara, you
          remember Cousin Zus. Please, go

          Zus takes Tuvia aside.

          ZUS
          Tuvia, I have pity for them all,

          BUT--

          TUVIA
          They are family.

          ZUS
          And how will we feed this family?

          TUVIA
          We'll water the soup.
          One of the new arrivals is a DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY. Tuvia and
          Zus watch her pass. Zus is particularly interested.

          ZUS
          And this one, is she family?

          Food, such as it is, is being handed out to SEVERAL NEW
          ARRIVALS. Asael brushes Aron's hair. Rachel sits beside
          her grieving father. She looks at Aron. He looks back.
          Nearby, Tuvia and Malbin are building a shelter. Malbin is
          hopelessly inept. A wall COLLAPSES.

          TUVIA
          Fuck me! Have you never used a
          hammer?

          MALBIN
          Uh. No.

          TUVIA
          What is it you do, then?

          MALBIN
          I suppose...you'd have to say...I
          was...am...an intellectual.

          TUVIA
          This is a job?

          MALBIN
          I published a small magazine...
          actually a journal...well, more
          like a pamphlet.
          Zus passes them, his arm around the dark-haired beauty.

          ZUS
          Tuvia, this is Rona. Rona is my
          forest wife.

          TUVIA
          I see. Congratulations.
          Zus winks and walks past. Malbin and Tuvia watch them.

          MALBIN
          Interesting concept.

          Suddenly the camp grows quiet.
          TWO YOUNG MEN who have emerged from the forest, their clothes
          dirty and torn. One of them aims an army-issue rifle.

          ZUS
          Hello, boys, what can we do for
          you?

          YOUNG MAN #1
          Food. We want food.
          Everyone remains still. Zus eyes his own rifle nearby.

          ZUS
          These little shits are holding us
          up.
          The Young Man motions his partner to take Zus's rifle.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          You little shits have the balls to
          shoot me?
          In response, the young man CHAMBERS A ROUND.

          TUVIA
          This is all the food we have. You
          are welcome to share.

          them up your ass.

          TUVIA
          Where are you from?
          The young man glares at Zus. Then, to Tuvia:

          YOUNG MAN #1
          Horodyszcze.
          The name freezes Zus in his tracks. His wife is there.

          PERETZ
          We haven't eaten in two days. My
          name is Peretz, this is Jacov.

          JACOV
          Two days ago there were three
          thousand Jews in Horodyszcze. Now
          there are fifty. Me and him, we
          hid in a wall.

          ZUS
          You know a woman there, Sonia
          Bielski?
          The men look at one another.

          JACOV
          We knew her.
          Zus can hardly bring himself to ask the next question.

          ZUS
          ...There was a child.
          Jacov shakes his head. Sorry.
          Zus leans his head against a tree. After a moment he begins
          to BEAT HIS HEAD against it until BLOOD pours down his face.

          ASAEL
          (to the newcomers)
          His family.
          Tuvia puts his arms around his brother. Zus's shoulders
          begin to heave. Soon his body convulses with deep wracking
          sobs. He is absolutely unself-conscious in his grief.

          I know.

          ZUS
          Mama. Papa.
          Their heads are close together, their faces wet with tears.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Why not us?

          TUVIA
          I don't know.

          ZUS
          I thought they'd be safe. I should
          have been with them.

          TUVIA
          No.

          ZUS
          I could have protected them.
          Tuvia just holds him. He, too, is crying quietly.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Better to be rabbits? Hunted?
          Hiding? No...
          Zus breaks free of Tuvia's embrace and walks away.

          41 LATER - BY THE FIRE 41
          Jacov and Peretz are eating. Between ravenous bites--

          PERETZ
          We are looking for partisans.

          JACOV
          What is the name of your otriad?
          Tuvia laughs ruefully.

          ASAEL
          What is an 'otriad?'

          TUVIA
          An armed brigade.

          JACOV
          We heard the Russians are beginning
          to organize.

          ASAEL
          Then we are the Bielski Otriad.
          You want to join?

          PERETZ
          (looks around)
          The Russians are fighters.

          JACOV
          --But you need a gun to join them.
          Without a gun you are nothing.
          They sabotage railroads and kill
          Germans.

          ZUS (O.S.)
          We will kill all the Germans you
          can handle. Starting tonight.
          They stare up at him, his face a mask of blood and filth.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          If you're not afraid to use that
          rifle.

          42 MOMENTS LATER - JUST OUTSIDE OF CAMP -- 42
          Zus is loading Wilencki's gun.

          TUVIA

          killing. We can't make more enemies--
          Zus concentrates on opening the breach.

          'Vengeance is mine.' Who said that?

          TUVIA
          So this is God's work you're doing,
          Zussie?

          ZUS
          No. Only YOU can play God. Save a
          few lives, take a few others...

          You are making the decisions now?
          A stand-off. Zus stares back at him. The struggle for
          command has grown more obvious.

          We wait for dark.

          earlier scene.

          MAN
          Who are you?

          (REALIZING)
          You don't understand. They made me
          give them my truck...
          Zus FIRES. Jacov and Peretz follow suit. The man goes
          down. They throw his DEAD BODY onto the burning truck.

          CUT TO:

          43A A CLUSTER OF HOUSES - LATER THAT NIGHT 43A
          Zus and Peretz are backing out of an open doorway, FIRING
          BACK INSIDE AS THEY GO. From within, the sound of SCREAMS.

          ZUS

          THIS IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU

          COOPERATE WITH NAZI SCUM..!
          FACES appear furtively at the windows of nearby houses.
          Zus addresses the little neighborhood, delirious with joy.

          44 A ROADSIDE DITCH - LATER THAT NIGHT 44
          Tuvia and Asael lie in on one side of a road. Tuvia has
          looped ONE END OF THE WIRE around a post.

          45 IN THE DITCH ON THE OTHER SIDE 45
          Zus, Peretz, and Jacov WRAP THE WIRE to a tree.

          The lights of a MOTORCYCLE, a GERMAN COURIER.

          47 IN THE DITCH 47
          Tuvia waits until the BIKE is almost upon them. Then he
          TIGHTENS the WIRE so it stretches INVISIBLY ACROSS THE ROAD.

          48 THE MOTORCYCLIST IS GARROTED 48
          by the wire. His bike goes sliding away as the Bielski's
          swarm him, KILLING HIM with the last bullet from the
          Mahkarov.
          ZUS rummages through the downed-bike's saddlebags. He finds
          a beautiful KNIFE and lifts it up triumphantly.

          PERETZ
          Look--!
          MORE HEADLIGHTS fast approaching.

          TUVIA
          Hide! Everyone!
          They all scramble back into the ditch, dragging the dead
          courier with them.

          49 A GERMAN STAFF CAR 49
          approaches. As its headlights pick up the downed motorcycle,
          it slows and pulls off to the side --

          50 DIRECTLY OVER THE DITCH 50
          Where Tuvia and Zus are concealed. From within the car, we
          hear VOICES SPEAKING GERMAN. A YOUNG PRIVATE gets out and
          walks up the road to investigate.

          PRIVATE
          (in German; subtitled)
          It's one of ours, but no one is
          here. Maybe he was drunk?
          From the car, an SERGEANT yells a reply.

          SERGEANT
          (in German; subtitled)
          Move it off the road before the
          convoy passes. I'll report the
          sonuvabitch.
          As the soldier drags the bike off the road, AN OFFICER steps
          out of the car and lights a cigarette.
          He's followed by the Sergeant. He carries a Schmeisser
          SUBMACHINE GUN dangling from his shoulder.

          51 IN THE DITCH - ZUS 51
          can see the Sergeant's feet peeking out over the ditch.

          A STREAM OF PISS
          Cascades onto him. He tries to inch his body away...

          THE PISSING SERGEANT
          catches the flicker of MOVEMENT below, SEES Zus lying in
          the ditch. Stunned, he tries to zip up his fly. It catches.
          ZUS LEAPS UP brandishing the KNIFE. He's on the Sergeant
          before he can get the gun off his shoulder. Stabbing him
          through his greatcoat, the BLADE BREAKS OFF IN HIS HAND.
          MEANWHILE, THE LIEUTENANT drops his cigarette, reaching
          under his coat for a pistol. Tuvia TACKLES him. The GUN
          skids away. They roll around on the road, CLAWING, PUNCHING,
          BITING. Tuvia SLAMS the man's head against the pavement.

          52 UP THE ROAD 52
          The Private sees Asael and Peretz coming at him. Jacov
          follows with his rifle. The Private turns and runs down
          the road. They give chase.

          53 FROM INSIDE THE CAR 53
          Another OFFICER is in the back seat with A WOMAN. He reaches
          for his gun, stands up in the seat and begins FIRING WILDLY
          at Tuvia. TUVIA ROLLS UNDER THE CAR, avoiding the burst.
          MEANWHILE, ZUS USES THE HANDLE OF THE KNIFE to BREAK the
          Sergeant's nose. He RIPS the SCHMEISSER away, firing point-
          blank into the man, whose greatcoat CATCHES FIRE.

          INSIDE THE STAFF CAR
          The officer takes close aim at Tuvia, just as ZUS TURNS THE
          MACHINE GUN on the car BLOWING OUT THE WINDOWS, killing the
          Officer and the woman -- and saving his brother's life.

          54 MEANWHILE, DOWN THE ROAD 54
          Jacov fires at the Private, MISSES. The man keeps RUNNING.
          Jacov fires again. MISSES AGAIN.
          FINALLY his THIRD SHOT hits him in the leg. The Private
          keeps running. Limping now.

          JACOV
          I got him!
          Peretz and Asael can now catch up to the soldier.

          FROM FAR AWAY
          We SEE them knock the Private to the ground, KICKING him
          until Jacov catches up to them and FIRES A FINAL SHOT.

          Tuvia stands, out of breath.

          TUVIA
          Stupid! The gunfire could be heard
          for miles.

          ZUS
          He was pissing on my head.
          Zus is high from the killing, covered in the dead man's
          blood. He begins calling out orders.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Peretz, Jacov, check the car for
          guns...
          (to Tuvia)
          This one's yours.
          He presents him with the Schmeisser as if it were a trophy.
          Tuvia accepts it, checking the gun efficiently.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          I'll check his pockets for more
          ammo.

          TUVIA
          Hurry--!

          AT THE STAFF CAR
          Peretz and Jacov emerge with two MACHINE-PISTOLS, several
          BOTTLES OF SCHNAPPS and a beautiful LEICA CAMERA.

          JACOV
          They were on their way to a party!
          They toss one bottle to Zus and another to Tuvia.

          56 UP THE ROAD 56
          Asael stands over the dead Private. He isn't much older
          than Aron.

          57 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 57
          ZUS rifles the pockets of the dead Sergeant for ammo. He
          finds cigarettes and the man's wallet. He opens it.

          ZUS
          Welcome to Belarus, herr Henkel.
          A CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS as Peretz and Jacov toast their
          victory.

          PERETZ
          Now we are real Partisans...

          JACOV
          To the Bielski Otriad!

          58 SUDDENLY - ANOTHER SET OF HEADLIGHTS 58
          are rounding the bend. Troop trucks. The Staff Car was
          leading A CONVOY.

          TUVIA
          Into the fields! RUN!
          Tuvia pulls Peretz off the road, but Jacov reloads his rifle
          and begins to FIRE at the approaching trucks.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Jacov, NO!
          THE TRUCKS STOP. Troops pour off and begin RETURNING FIRE.
          Jacov is CUT DOWN by a MACHINE GUN.
          Peretz, Zus, and Tuvia race into the WHEAT FIELD. It's not
          clear if they can make it into the woods. A FLARE IGNITES
          OVERHEAD turning the wheat fields BRIGHT WHITE in flickering
          incandescence. Malbin is almost paralytic with fear.
          ASAEL doesn't know which way to run. He plunges into the
          WHEAT FIELD...but ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD.
          ONE OF THE TRUCKS drives forward, CUTTING HIM OFF, using
          its SPOTLIGHT to reveal him. FIFTEEN SOLDIERS start after
          him.

          59 SEEN FROM ABOVE 59
          We watch as they CONVERGE on him.

          TUVIA, ZUS AND PERETZ
          Have almost made it into the woods when PERETZ IS HIT. He
          falls. Tuvia and Zus pick him up and half-carry, half-drag
          him into the sanctuary of the forest.

          TUVIA
          Zus. His rifle.
          Zus races back to pick up Peretz's weapon.

          60 ASAEL, MEANWHILE 60
          has realized his mistake. He tries to circle back toward
          the woods but the SOLDIERS move to CUT HIM OFF. He is fast,
          but not fast enough. We realize he isn't going to make it.

          61 IN THE WOODS 61
          Tuvia and Zus look at the scene with mounting horror.

          TUVIA
          Asael...
          He rips the rifle from Zus's hands. For a moment we think
          he's going to go back after him. Instead, he wedges the
          rifle into a tree-trunk and takes careful aim...

          THE SPOTLIGHT SHATTERS
          Plunging the field into darkness as the flare burns out.
          ASAEL seizes the moment and dives to his knees, disappearing
          from view and CRAWLING NOW rather than expose himself.
          AN IRRIGATION DITCH is nearby. Frantically he DIGS into
          the soft mud on its banks. As he scrapes his hands raw, he
          can HEAR his pursuers drawing near, CALLING OUT to one
          another.

          CUT TO:

          62 THE FOREST CAMP - DAWN 62
          A somber mood. Tuvia watches someone scrape at the porridge
          congealed in an empty pot. OTHERS stare listlessly into
          space. ONE MAN chews on a piece of leather, ANOTHER sucks
          on an old chicken bone.
          Zus, meanwhile, is in the middle of a nasty drunk from the
          captured schnapps. Nearby, Aron shares his ration of bread
          with Rachel. Little enough, but a connection is made.
          Peretz lies nearby. Malbin is trying to comforts him.
          There is nothing that can help him. Malbin looks to Tuvia.

          SHIMON
          They thought you were bringing food.
          Tuvia just stares at him.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          Did the farmers stop you?
          Still no answer from Tuvia.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          They had guns? Dogs?

          TUVIA
          No.

          SHIMON
          I don't understand.
          Tuvia says nothing. Nearby, a child cries in hunger.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          The Talmud says if you save a life
          you must take responsibility for
          it.

          TUVIA
          Again I have no idea what you are
          talking about.
          Around them, the beseeching eyes of so many hungry faces.

          SHIMON
          I think you do.

          VOICE
          You are the Bielski's?
          A MAN stands in the clearing. BEN ZION GULKOWITZ is tall,
          well muscled, a rifle strapped over his shoulder.

          ZUS
          How'd you get past the Lazar?

          BEN ZION
          Who?
          Zus stands unsteadily, then lurches into the woods, leaning
          on an occasional tree for support. He finds the erstwhile
          sentry --LAZAR -- ambling toward him.

          ZUS
          You shit! You worthless shit!
          Zus punches him, knocking him the ground. In a sloppy,
          drunken frenzy, Zus SLAPS him again.

          TUVIA
          Enough!

          ZUS
          He walked right by you! Someone
          could have been killed!
          Tuvia pulls Zus off him.

          TUVIA
          I said, enough!
          (to Lazar)
          Get up! Get up!

          ZUS
          If we were real partisans he'd be
          shot.

          TUVIA

          ZUS
          MISTAKE! We cannot make mistakes!
          As Zus goes for Lazar again, Tuvia roughly PULLS HIM OFF.
          Zus goes flying, tripping over, landing on his ass.

          TUVIA
          That's right, Zus. No mistakes.
          Like last night.
          (looks at him)
          First they will torture Asael...and
          then they will hang him.
          Tuvia walks away, leaving his brother on the ground.

          63 BACK IN CAMP 63
          Tuvia rejoins them. Ben Zion looks up at him.

          BEN ZION
          You are Tuvia Bielski.

          TUVIA
          You know me?

          BEN ZION
          I am Ben Zion Gulkowitz.
          Ben Zion is besieged by questions about friends and family.

          MIRIAM
          Pardon me, you are from Vilna. My
          sister lives on Passaya Street.

          BEN ZION
          The SD came without warning.
          Hundreds were taken. No one knows
          where.

          THE WOMAN begins to cry.

          MIRIAM
          My poor sister...dear God, no...
          Meanwhile, Peretz's MOANING ceases. A woman grumbles:

          WOMAN #1
          We'd be better off in the ghetto...

          TAMARA
          At least here we are safe.

          LOVA
          There at least we had hope...

          SHIMON
          No. Here, we have hope.
          A FEW MORE join in, grumbling their dissatisfaction. Others
          take the opposite position. These are Jews, after all, and
          arguing is a revered sport and a pastime. It escalates.

          WOMAN #1
          We are hungry!
          This is a defining moment for Tuvia. When at first he
          speaks, it is awkward, ineffectual amid the growing tumult.

          TUVIA
          I know we have no food. But
          tomorrow... tomorrow will be another
          mission.

          RONA
          Look what happened the last time.

          TUVIA
          That was a mistake! But the mistakes
          we made will not be made again!
          More objections. Tuvia must raise his voice to be heard.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          We could be here a long time. And
          we have to prepare.

          LOVA
          How?

          TUVIA
          Better security. Better at getting
          food and information--
          (talking over their

          OBJECTIONS)
          --at making shelters. Whatever is
          needed. We all participate. We
          don't work against each other.
          At this he looks directly at Zus. Daring him to object.

          Not right now. We cannot afford to
          lose friends like Jacov and Peretz.
          A small voice speaks up.

          ARON
          Or Asael.
          Everyone stares. It is the first time Aron has spoken.

          TOGETHER)
          --cannot lose anyone.
          He looks from face to face. Filthy, ravaged, many of them
          with tears in their eyes. This is what they need --
          leadership, faith, something to believe in.
          And gradually, his tentativeness and awkwardness is replaced
          by something else. A new voice. From deep inside.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          ...We will map out where we've been
          so as to not visit the same farms
          too often. And we take only from
          those who can afford to give, and
          leave those who can't alone.

          LOVA
          The poorest farmer has more than
          us.

          TUVIA
          True. But what I am saying is...
          what I mean is... We are not thieves.
          (his resolve growing
          with every word)
          Or murderers. We may be hunted
          like animals but we will not become
          animals.
          (looks at them all)
          We have all chosen this -- to live
          free, like human beings, for as
          long as we can. Each day of freedom
          is an act of faith. And if we die
          trying to live, at least we die
          like human beings.
          His mission statement. A vision of their future.
          Everyone nods in mute acknowledgement. Zus lowers his head.
          The shift in power between them has occurred. Tuvia has
          emerged as the undisputed leader.

          66 OUTSIDE THE HOUSE 66
          Koscik's wife looks up from her garden and glares at them.

          TUVIA
          Hello.
          She refuses to be flattered. In Russian:

          KOSCIK'S WIFE
          In the barn.

          67 IN THE BARN 67
          Zus calls out.

          ZUS
          Koscik, put your pants back on and
          leave those sheep alone.
          He steps into the shadows to find:

          KOSCIK HANGING FROM A THRESHING HOOK
          that has been driven through his chest. A sign attached to

          Two LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN -- BELLA and CHAYA -- emerge,

          No...

          BELLA
          Tell him, Chaya. Was it not the
          absolute worst? And that farmer,
          Mr. Koscik, kept making the most
          vulgar jokes, he said any girl who--
          As they continue out of earshot, it appears as though Zus
          would be happy to listen for hours.

          71 A TOWERING PINE FOREST 71
          Aron and Rachel are walking through the woods. For a brief
          moment, viewed through the eyes of the young, we see these
          woods as a magical place. Strange mushrooms, gnarled roots,
          an enormous spider's web glistening with dew.

          72 THE CAMP HAS BEGUN TO SHOW PROGRESS 72
          Sentries are posted. Zus expertly helps with the building
          a bunker ("zemylanka"). There's a more permanent kitchen,
          a wash trough, a clothesline. Pinchas tends his goat.
          Though primitive and raw...a haven.

          SHIMON AND MALBIN ARE DIGGING A HOLE
          Their bickering will become for them, as time goes on, a
          sport and a pastime.

          MALBIN
          You're trying to tell me all politics
          is meaningless.

          SHIMON
          In the West a monster with a little
          mustache, in the East a monster
          with a big mustache. This is all I
          need to know about politics.

          MALBIN
          Your messiah will have a mustache,
          too, and a full beard.

          SHIMON
          No. The messiahs are all in

          73 WALKING THROUGH THE CAMP TUVIA AND ASAEL 73
          review their plans.

          TUVIA
          We need to know what's going on in
          the villages, how the Germans patrol,
          who the informers are--
          He realizes that Asael is not fully concentrating; instead
          he is watching as Chaya walks past.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Are you listening to me?

          ASAEL
          Yes.

          TUVIA
          What's her name?

          ASAEL
          Chaya. [I believe.]

          TUVIA

          (YELLING)

          CHAYA!
          He waves as Chaya turns to look in their direction. Asael
          smiles, embarrassed.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          So talk to her.

          ASAEL
          I hardly know her.

          TUVIA
          You spent three days in a cellar!
          Asael blushes, returns the focus to their prior conversation.

          ASAEL
          Malbin says the Piznarksi granary
          is full. We need two guns at
          least...

          TUVIA
          Whose turn to go?

          ASAEL
          Zus.

          TUVIA
          You go along, just to make sure he
          understands my orders.
          Asael nods.

          74 NEAR A SHED ROOF - BEN ZION 74
          We notice a FEW NEW FACES. Their number has exceeded twenty.
          Among them are two lumbering, dark-skinned men, ARKADY and
          MOTL LUBCZANSKI. Ben Zion is showing Lazar and the other
          newcomers how to clean a weapon.

          BEN ZION
          This is not a gun. It is Bar
          Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword.
          You fix the patch to the rod--
          They do as he instructs.

          BEN ZION (CONT'D)
          --then run it through the barrel...
          and don't lose the patch in the

          BARREL--
          Lazar looks up, sheepishly.

          LAZAR
          I lost my patch.
          ARKADY LUBCZANSKI whispers contemptuously to his brother,

          MOTL...

          ARKADY LUBCZANSKI
          The village idiot.
          Zus shoves Arkady out of the way and approaches Lazar, who
          cowers. But rather than abuse him, Zus removes the patch
          from the rifle and hands it back to him.

          LAZAR
          Thank you, Zus.

          ZUS
          (returning the rifle)
          It's nothing.

          76 A ROADSIDE - NEXT DAY 76
          KISSELY is a MILKMAN with bright red hair and a bushy
          mustache. He leads a horse-drawn CART laden with milk cans.
          ZUS AND THE OTHERS rise up out of the ditch. In Russian:

          ZUS
          (a pleasant tone)
          Good morning, friend. Getting an
          early start to market? Could you
          possibly spare us a bit of milk?
          Zus' tone is belied by the rifle in his hand.

          KISSELY
          This is what I'm required to give
          the Germans. If I don't meet my
          quota they'll shoot me and my family.
          Zus is tempted to shoot him himself.

          ASAEL
          (to Zus)
          Leave half. He can't go to the
          Germans empty-handed.
          Zus glares at Asael.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          Tuvia's orders.
          Zus shakes his head, climbs onto the wagon and begins
          removing cartons.

          We are so grateful, comrade, for

          coat. Is that a fur collar?

          joins the others lugging milk cans along the forest path.

          LAZAR (V.O.)

          HALT! WHO GOES THERE!
          Zus shakes his head. Lazar stands, pointing his weapon.

          ZUS
          Lazar, you can see it's us, you
          idiot. You only ask, 'who goes
          there' when you don't know who it
          is.

          LAZAR
          Sorry, Zus.

          78 THE CAMP 78
          is a beehive of activity. Shimon and Malbin are digging.

          MALBIN
          Even Spinoza said existence can be
          substantiated by empirical evidence.

          SHIMON
          All your secular learning, yet you
          know nothing of life.

          MALBIN
          How can you say this? Learning is
          my life.

          SHIMON
          And for every fact that goes in
          your head, another comes out your
          rear end.
          CHAYA and BELLA receive the bounty from the foragers.

          BELLA
          Milk, eggs -- Chaya, our brave men
          have brought us a feast!

          ZUS

          She bestows her best smile upon him.

          ARKADY
          I don't think we've been properly
          introduced. Arkady Lubczanski.

          CHAYA
          Hello.

          ARKADY
          You are Chaya?

          CHAYA
          ...Yes.

          ARKADY
          You are getting along all right?
          Anything you need? An extra blanket?

          CHAYA
          Oh. Well... Yes, that would be
          nice.

          ARKADY
          You'll have it by tonight. Something
          nice and soft.
          (smiles at her)
          I couldn't help but notice you don't
          have a husband yet.

          No. But thank you for explaining
          it.
          She hurries away. Malbin sits down wearily beside Shimon.

          MALBIN
          Descartes at least provided for the
          subjective nature of experience.
          He takes a spoon from his sock.

          SHIMON
          Yes. You annoy me therefore I exist.

          MALBIN
          You are not eating?

          SHIMON
          By my best calculation, today is
          High Holiday. I am fasting.
          Malbin can't believe this. He rolls his eyes and digs in.
          One of the NEWCOMERS has brought a violin. He begins to
          play. A bittersweet melody. People stop talking and listen,
          eyes filling at this reminder of a sweeter, civilized time.
          Ben Zion has left the new arrivals and approached Tuvia.
          He looks grave. Tuvia immediately knows something is wrong.

          TUVIA
          What is it?

          BEN ZION
          The new ones, they are from
          Novagroduk. Your wife--
          Tuvia tenses. Ben Zion hesitates...

          BEN ZION (CONT'D)
          They say...She was killed last week.
          (at a loss)
          I'm sorry.
          Tuvia nods. No outward display of grief. An awkward moment.

          TUVIA
          Thank you for telling me.
          (changes the subject)
          We have to dig a trench around the
          new zemylanka. If it rains I'm
          afraid water will seep in.
          Tuvia clearly cannot deal with his news.

          BEN ZION
          I'll see to it, then.

          shafts.

          ARON
          Jacob's ladders. Like in his dream.
          Asael says you can see the angels.
          They walk on, eventually coming upon RAILROAD TRACKS. A
          TRAIN is rounding the bend, headed in their direction.

          RACHEL
          Can we stay to watch?

          ARON
          If we hide.
          They move back into the trees as the train NEARS: a slow-
          moving engine pulling a line of WOODEN CATTLE CARS.

          RACHEL
          Is that a Nazi train?

          ARON
          If we had some dynamite we could
          blow the shit out of it.

          Aron can't help but be pleased by this notion.
          Then, as the train passes, they can see HANDS gripping the
          small barred windows. And every now and then a gaunt,
          desperate FACE.

          SHIMON
          I am sorry for your loss.
          Tuvia nods. He is deep inside himself.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          Do you want to say the Kaddish?
          When at last Tuvia speaks, it is almost to himself.

          TUVIA
          She was a beautiful woman. But
          cold. Not a day went by she didn't
          remind me I wasn't a good provider.
          For years it wasn't really a marriage
          at all. And now...
          He lowers his head. All Shimon can do is sit beside him.

          Chaya digs in her pocket and produces a tiny remnant. Bella
          dabs it on and casually approaches Zus, who is on guard
          duty.

          Why is there a rule against women
          having guns?

          ZUS
          There aren't enough for the men.

          ZUS
          What for?

          BELLA
          For protection.

          ZUS
          Women have men for protection.
          Bella bites her lip. She's a virgin but also realistic.

          BELLA
          I want protection.
          She steps closer and takes Zus's hand...under her coat...onto
          her breast...never taking her eyes off him.

          Chaos.
          People panic, search for family members, grab whatever they
          can carry,
          ZUS AND BELLA emerge from the woods where they have lain
          together for the first time. He grabs his rifle.

          ZUS

          THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF US! WHO IS

          THE FOOL?
          The policemen exchange apprehensive looks.

          TUVIA

          WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

          POLICEMAN

          KARELITZ!
          The confrontation changes languages.

          BEN ZION

          I'M FROM KARELITZ, TOO. I LIVED BY

          THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE.

          POLICEMAN

          MAYBE I KNOW YOU. SHOW YOURSELF!

          BEN ZION

          YOU FIRST!
          Derisive laughter from the trees.

          POLICEMAN
          Give us Bielski and the rest of you
          can go free!
          Behind a tree, Tuvia is surprised by the mention of his
          name.

          TUVIA
          You are from Belarussia, pig! Why
          do you work for the Germans against
          your own people?

          KISSELY
          For the same reason you steal from
          the poor. To survive.
          ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT. Kessely is hit in the arm.

          KISSELY (CONT'D)
          Shit.

          ZUS

          find your way home then!
          The policemen are having similar thoughts.

          SUDDENLY - A POLICEMAN BREAKS AND RUNS AWAY
          Soon it's a full-scale retreat.

          AFTER A MOMENT
          Tuvia, Zus, Lova & Ben Zion emerge. Zus picks up the dead
          German's machine pistol.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          They'll be back.
          (looks around)
          We have to find a new camp.

          ZUS
          Next time just draw them a map.

          TUVIA
          What does that mean?

          ZUS
          It means -- we should have killed
          the fucking milkman. Your policy
          of diplomacy is shit.
          Zus is breathing hard, full of the adrenaline of battle.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          ...Two are dead. Winter is coming
          and now we have no shelter. Why?
          Because you don't have the stomach

          88 THE NOVEMBER WIND WHISTLES THROUGH THE BARE FOREST (MONTAGE) 88
          as the group trudges along -- weighed down by cooking gear,
          food, guns, etc. Asael takes the iron cauldron from Chaya.
          Zus and Bella walk side-by-side. Pinchas leads his goat.

          MALBIN
          Where is he taking us? My feet are
          going to fall off.

          SHIMON
          A great rabbi once said, "wherever
          I go, I am always going to the land
          of Israel."

          MALBIN
          Well, maybe rabbis should give better
          directions.
           Tuvia walks alongside but apart.

           CUT TO:

          89 A HILLSIDE 89
          The group is sprawled on the ground. Four people share a
          single cigarette. Shimon and Malbin hardly have the energy
          to argue. Pinchas feeds his goat. Tuvia walks among them.

          TUVIA
          Rest and eat. I need volunteers
          for a scouting party.
          Zus raises his hand. Tuvia nods in grudging gratitude.
          However mixed his feelings, Zus can always be counted on.

          90 A FORK IN THE TRAIL 90
          Tuvia looks at Zus, who shrugs. They are in unfamiliar
          territory. As they move cautiously forward:

          A MAN IN A RED ARMY TUNIC
          steps into the path, holding an automatic rifle. He WHISTLES
          softly. More ARMED MEN materialize, surrounding them.

          GRAMOV
          (in Russian; subtitles)

          WHO ARE YOU?
          Tuvia instantly grasps the situation. He salutes.

          TUVIA

          searching for our comrades.

          Zus's finger tightens on the trigger of his submachine gun.

          ZUS
          I'll take the two on the left...
          Tuvia maintains his composure.

          TUVIA

          A primitive tent camp. RUSSIAN PARTISANS move about, quiet
          and cold-eyed men wearing remnants of Red Army uniforms.
          Zus can't help but be impressed by the array of weaponry.
          VICTOR PACHENKO emerges from a tent. A former lieutenant,
          dashing in a fur cap and long officer's coat. He addresses
          them in Russian.

          VIKTOR
          I am Viktor Panchenko, commander of
          the October otriad. We have had
          complaints of a Jewish gang stealing
          from villages loyal to us.
          (a steely look)
          How do you respond to these charges?

          TUVIA
          When you take food it is from loyal
          supporters. When we do, you call
          it stealing.

          VIKTOR
          We are soldiers.

          TUVIA
          And we fight a common enemy. The
          motherland doesn't distinguish
          between Jews and non-Jews.
          Viktor is amused by this bit of Soviet dogma.

          VIKTOR
          But Jews do not fight.

          VIKTOR
          We will see. Select your best
          fighters and send them to us.
          Zus looks at Tuvia, knowing he has no choice.

          TUVIA
          We are honored to be of service.
          Tuvia and Zus SALUTE and head back the way they came.

          ZUS
          (under his breath)
          So we're partisans now.

          TUVIA
          As if we have a choice.

          92 THE NEW CAMP (CAMP #2) 92
          Tuvia and Malbin are working together on a new bunker.
          Malbin expertly nails a header across a doorway.

          Club could see me now...
          (shakes his head)
          I haven't read a book in months.

          TUVIA
          I haven't read one in years.
          Malbin looks up from his work.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          I wasn't a very good student. You
          can ask Shimon.

          MALBIN
          .I did.
          Tuvia laughs ruefully. Considers him for a moment.

          Yet you accept me as Commander.

          Tuvia nods. Good point. They continue working.

          MALBIN (CONT'D)
          Might I make an observation?
          Tuvia gestures, go ahead.

          MALBIN (CONT'D)
          We need to be strong, but--

          TUVIA
          ...But--?

          MALBIN
          Other things are important, too.

          TUVIA
          Such as?
          Malbin tries to think how best to put it.

          MALBIN
          Community.
          Tuvia considers the word. As if trying it on for size.

          TUVIA
          You have more ideas? About all
          this?

          MALBIN
          ...A few.

          More young bodies to keep us warm.
          One ot them, a young man, YITZHAK SHULMAN, RIPS the yellow
          Star-of-David off his coat and kneels to KISS THE GROUND.

          SHULMAN
          Which one is Tuvia Bielski?
          Someone points Tuvia out. Shulman hurries over and kisses
          Tuvia's hand. Zus is drinking nearby with his cronies.

          Zus catches Tuvia's glance to Malbin. Tuvia turns back to

          Asael is completely undone by the starkness of this.

          Tuvia exchanges a glance with Malbin. Zus catches it. He

          You won't let that happen.

          You are the man of her dreams? The
          Romeo of Novagrudok?
          Zus can't take anymore. He charges Tuvia, who sidesteps
          and SLAMS him in the gut. All the frustration of the past
          months, not to mention years of sibling rivalry, translates
          into fists and elbows.
          Ben Zion moves to break it up. Tuvia and Zus turn on him.

          ZUS
          Is this your business?
          Zus gains the upper hand and starts to beat the crap put of
          Tuvia. Finally, in desperation Tuvia rolls away and picks
          up a rock. He is about to slam it into his brother's head
          when suddenly he stops himself.
          The two brothers look at each other, both breathing heavily --
          realizing that they have crossed some line.

          Are you coming?
          Asael looks at one brother, then the other. Once again, he

          No.

          that might once have been home to a family-of-four now HOUSES
          fifteen. Tuvia and Asael are deep in conversation with
          several ELDERS of the ghetto Council

          ELDER #1
          We are not so naive as to believe
          they won't kill some of us. But
          all the Jews? It makes no sense.
          They need us to work. In the
          factories. The labor camps.
          Tuvia notices A PRETTY GIRL standing on a chair in order to
          hear. Her name is LILKA and we will soon come to know her.

          TUVIA
          There are rumors. Of death camps.

          ELDER #1
          We too have heard of such places.
          But have you seen them yourself?
          Can you tell me, with absolute
          certainty, that we are not just as
          likely to die out there with you in
          the woods with Winter coming on...?
          Someone WHISTLES from the street below. A tense moment.
          Another whistle. All clear.

          ELDER #1 (CONT'D)
          --Do you think we haven't all
          considered running away? For every
          one that leaves they kill twenty.
          How can I sacrifice thousands for
          the sake of a few?"
          Tuvia looks at them, rubbing his face in concentration.

          TUVIA
          What if we were to take all of you?

          ELDER #1
          The old, the sick? There are
          thousands. How will we live?

          TUVIA
          We will protect you. We have made
          alliances with the Russian Partisans.

          ELDER #1
          They are as bad as the Nazi's. You
          are too young to know the pogroms--

          An old orthodox RABBI stands nearby.

          Rabbi?

          RABBI
          We...are waiting for God.
          Tuvia looks at him in disbelief. Such madness is
          incontrovertible. A suspended moment.

          LILKA
          I am going.
          This breaks the log jam. Several others join in, "We are
          coming," "Us, too," etc. Tuvia nods his acknowledgment.

          A crude tunnel has been dug through a ghetto wall. PEOPLE
          squeeze through into the adjoining alley. Behind them, a
          hundred more await their turn.
          Out in the alley, Asael stops them momentarily as a car
          goes by at the end of the street, then gives the all-clear.
          Tuvia takes Lilka' hand and helps her pass through. Their

          The new ARRIVALS file in. Men wear citified coats and some
          women have furs. They eye the veterans, thinking, 'how
          dirty they are'; the veterans eye them warily, wondering,
          'How will we feed them?'
          A handmade sign reads, "New Jerusalem." Chaya is re-united
          with her parents. She holds Asael's arm and looks up at
          him with absolute rapture. She is his.
          Malbin is collecting valuables. One WELL-DRESSED WOMAN is
          reluctant to part with her jewelry.

          Everyone sacrifices for the sake of
          the collective. We can trade these
          for food or weapons. Next...
          Nearby, Shimon is INTERVIEWING another line of arrivals.

          SHIMON
          --How about carpenters? Any
          bootmakers? Seamstresses?

          OPPENHEIM is an old man with thick glasses.

          OPPENHEIM
          I am a watchmaker.
          Tuvia has walked over to observe.

          TUVIA

          Guns? No.

          TUVIA

          See if you can fix this trigger.
          Oppenheim slips on a pair of spectacles and studies the
          mechanism. It sticks. He digs into his pocket and produces
          a small file and expertly begins to shave the metal spur.
          He tests it, then hands it back to Tuvia, who CLICKS the
          trigger.

          He mounts her easily, urges her around the perimeter,
          greeting the new arrivals. Heads turn as he trots past.
          He is the center of attention, and he knows it. And likes
          it.

          Friends, we are happy to see you
          safely among us. But there are
          many things you must learn about
          living here...
          All attention turns to him. The Lubczanski brothers grumble
          to each other, none too pleased with Tuvia's show-boating.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Once you are settled, you'll be
          assigned work duties. Everyone
          works, no exceptions.

          We will help supply the Russian
          Partisans by making clothes,
          repairing guns.

          Malbin catches his eye and winks -- clearly this has been
          part of their "strategy" discussions.

          TUVIA
          Women will learn to use weapons and
          fight alongside men.
          Tuvia takes a rifle from Asael and holds it aloft.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          This is not a gun. It is Bar
          Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword.

          yourselves.

          Pregnancies are forbidden. We cannot

          Lilka awakens to find TEN WOMEN wedged in beside her --
          back to front -- like spoons.
          Idly, she begins to ITCH her scalp. Then her leg. In the
          pale morning light she sees that she is crawling with lice.
          She SCREAMS. The women around her wake up, terrified.

          effectively RETURNING FIRE. Several partisans are KILLED.
          ZUS PULLS A POTATO MASHER GRENADE from his belt and RUNS AT
          THE TRUCK in a mad headlong assault.

          ZUS (CONT'D)

          ARRRRGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
          He ROLLS THE GRENADE under the truck and dives away as it
          EXPLODES. The remaining Germans RAISE THEIR HANDS.
          CHEERING PARTISANS leap into the truck, capturing an arsenal
          of rifles and ammo. THE JEWISH FIGHTERS join in the looting.
          Boots, coats, blankets, etc.
          Zus approaches the wounded and captured German prisoners,
          kneeling in surrender, hands behind their necks.
          Without hesitation, he shoots them, point-blank, one after
          another.
          VIKTOR approaches Zus, who salutes.

          VIKTOR
          You are related to Bielski?

          ZUS
          I am a Bielski, too.
          Viktor looks at him appraisingly.

          VIKTOR
          Indeed.
          He walks away. Zus has found a home.

          109 THE RUSSIAN WINTER (MONTAGE- MUSIC OVER) 109
          SNOW covers the camp. A driving wind. Bundled in scarves,
          overcoats and as many layers as they can wear, Bella and
          Chaya break ice in a pot. Tamara takes FROZEN LAUNDRY from
          a line.
          In a bunker, Malbin and Shimon shiver under a shared blanket.
          Women and children stare blankly into space.
          Riva unwraps rags from a man's foot and examines his toes,
          BLACK with frostbite.
          Asael and Tuvia are making their rounds. They pass Aron
          and Rachel who have built a snowman which they top off by
          adding a German helmet with a bullet hole in it.

          109A IN A STORAGE AREA 109A
          Asael shows Tuvia the last few potatoes.

          ASAEL
          There is talk of returning to the 
          ghetto.

          TUVIA
          Madness.

          ASAEL
          They've barely eaten in days. Even
          when our food missions manage to
          get through, there are armed patrols.
          Farmers who once helped us now guard
          their barns with shotguns.
          Tuvia considers for a moment.

          TUVIA
          Send out more missions. And bring
          shotguns.
          Tuvia sets off. In every face he passes, there's misery
          and accusation in the shivering bodies and trembling blue
          lips. Children stare at him with sunken, haunted eyes.

          109AA A MAKESHIFT STABLE 109AA
           Tuvia visits his beautiful horse. He unties him.

          109AB LATER - IN THE FOOD LINE 109AB
           A whisper runs through the group..."meat"..."what kind?"..."
           Where'd it come from?"
           Tuvia watches them eat hungrily.

          109E A STABLE - NIGHT 109E
          Snow falling outside. Several partisans are singing. Zus
          is drinking heavily with Viktor; they take pinches of salt
          with each swallow. Viktor finishes a bottle, tosses it.

          VIKTOR
          Another dead soldier!
          Zus looks at him, bleary-eyed, confused. Viktor explains:

          VIKTOR (CONT'D)
          More dead soldiers than empty
          bottles.

          ZUS
          (slurring his words)
          That is so...Russian.
          He cracks open another bottle and takes a big slug.

          VIKTOR
          At least you drink like one.

          ZUS
          'A Jew can't drink, a Jew can't
          fight.' What is it we are good at,
          Viktor? Dying. That is what we
          are good at.

          So tell me about this brother of
          yours...

          I know who you mean... The Great
          Tuvia Bielski. Savior of the Jews
          and all around Big Shit.

          VIKTOR
          You compete with him.

          ZUS
          He competes with me.

          VIKTOR
          My older brother and I have the
          same relationship.

          ZUS
          He is a Big Shit also?

          VIKTOR
          A soldier.
          (a long moment)
          He was killed in the first hour of
          the German invasion.
          This sobers them up a bit.

          109F IN THE ZEMYLANKA 109F
          LILKA is shivering, her eyes inward and unfocused.

          TUVIA
          Lilka?

          LILKA
          Sorry, Tuvia. I was...thinking.
          It's nothing.
          He looks at her intently, knowing there's more.

          LILKA (CONT'D)
          ...Every time new people come into
          camp, I keep hoping... even though,
          I know...

          ...I'm sorry.

          Everyone here has lost someone.
          She looks up at him, helpless to be so revealed.

          LILKA
          You too?

          TUVIA

          LILKA
          No. Today I go on my first food
          mission.
          Tuvia's order has consigned her to this dangerous duty.

          TUVIA
          I will have Asael send someone else.

          LILKA
          No. I must go now. I want to go.
          She is clearly scared but desperate not to show it. He
          reaches into his belt and hands her a revolver.

          TUVIA
          You know how to use this?
          She nods. Leaving, she passes the Lubczanski brothers, who
          are on their way in.

          No? We were told, 'hands off,'
          property of the Commander.
          Tuvia just stares, daring him to continue.

          111 LATER THAT DAY 111
          Tuvia walks past the now-empty stable heading into the woods.
          A voice calls out of the misty snow.

          VOICE

          HALT! WHO GOES THERE--!

          TUVIA
          Lazar. I am coming from camp. The

          No sign of the food mission?

          LAZAR
          Not yet.
          Tuvia looks anxiously into the deep woods.

          111A MEANWHILE - DEEP IN THE WOODS 111A
          Lilka and Shulman are walking backwards, retracing their
          steps to obscure their footprints in the drifting snow.

          SHULMAN
          We mustn't have any tracks leading
          back to base.
          He loads two sacks of food onto her shoulders.

          SHULMAN (CONT'D)
          Stay on this side of the creek until
          you reach the river then up the
          hill.
          (points the way)
          I'll wait here for the others.
          She nods and trudges on toward camp through waist-deep snow.

          112 BACK IN CAMP - OUTSIDE A MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY 112
          As they head toward a zemylanka, Riva is briefing Tuvia on
          the sick. Every now and then, he glances toward the woods.

          RIVA
          --several cases of pneumonia...
          Also I'm beginning to see signs of
          scurvy. No one's had a vegetable
          in weeks.

          LAZAR
          Tuvia!
          Lazar is dragging a WOUNDED MAN back into camp.

          RIVA 
          Bring him to the infirmary.
          Tuvia glances back toward the woods. Looks at his watch.

          RIVA (CONT'D)
          ...Shulman will look after her.
          He looks up. She looks at him sympathetically. Apparently
           his interest in Lilka isn' quite as secret as he imagines. 

          112A BACK TO THE WOODS 112A
          Exhausted, cold and alone, Lilka is becoming increasingly
          disoriented in a snowy landscape where every tree looks

          alike. She turns in a circle, trying to decide which way
          to go.
          A MANGY DOG appears out of nowhere, its coat matted, its
          ribs showing, a wild look in its eye. It GROWLS ferociously.

          But the dog, as ravenous as she, smells the food and won't
          back down. It inches forward, FOAMING at the mouth.
          Lilka tries to step back but the dog LUNGES, snapping its
          jaws. It's terrifying. She looks desperately for help.
          Suddenly the dog LEAPS at her. She turns away and it rips
          a sack from her shoulder, knocking her down. Viciously it
          begins tearing the sack apart in search of the food within.
          A SHOT RINGS OUT. The dog drops.
          Lilka holds the smoking gun in two hands. Grimly, she pockets
          the weapon, picks up the sack of food, and starts off.
          Reconsidering, she walks back and hoists the dead dog onto
          her shoulder, too. More food.

          112B IN THE INFIRMARY 112B
          Riva bandages Edjelman's head. Tuvia looks at all the sick.

          TUVIA
          What's wrong with them all?

          RIVA
          If it's typhus we're in trouble.
          The lice are carriers.

          ASAEL
          The partisans have ampicillin. But
          they say they need it for themselves.
          In the background Lilka enters, face scratched, blood smeared
          hands and arms -- like some kind of primitive huntress.

          LILKA
          Fine.

          Thank you.
          Tuvia can clearly see that she is shaken -- but he has no
          time to ask more. He has to find out about the medicine.

          Tuvia and Zus sit in the cab of an old truck, its exhaust
          sending plumes of condensation into the freezing night.

          ZUS
          Well...
          He looks into the back where the others wait, anxiously
          clutching their weapons. Tuvia tries to hold back a cough.

          Stay with the truck. And make sure
          it's in gear when we get back.

          I'm going in with you.

          I give the orders tonight.
          Across the square, the police station looms.

          TUVIA
          You don't have to do this.

          ZUS

          I have been given this mission by
          my superior officer.
          He starts to get out the cab. Tuvia reaches into his pocket,
          takes out the mezuzah that once blessed their parents' home.

          TUVIA
          Zus...
          (hands him the mezuzah)
          For luck.
          Zuz pockets it and joins the others creeping into the
          shadows.
          But rather than follow them into the police station, we
          HOLD on Tuvia's face. Suddenly we HEAR The sound of gunfire.
          Then nothing. Ten seconds. More gunfire. Twenty. It is
          excruciating. Thirty. The longest CLOSE-UP in film history.

          Zus lays his head back on the seat, closes his eyes.

          Tuvia is still drinking heavily. He is COUGHING STEADILY,
          his face sweaty with fever.
          The SOUND of angry voices from outside the bunker.

          122 OUTSIDE - IN THE FOOD LINE 122
          Arkady Lubczanski has pulled a knife on Asael, who backs
          away, STUMBLING into a group of bystanders.

          ARKADY
          Next time, I cut off your nose,
          pisher.
          Tuvia emerges from his bunker. He is weaving a bit and his
          words are slurred.

          TUVIA
          Whassa problem, Arkady?

          ARKADY
          Those who risk their lives to bring
          back food deserve a larger portion
          than those who risk nothing.

          ASAEL
          Everyone gets the same portion.

          ARKADY
          Not when you're serving, pisher. I
          see you digging to the bottom of
          the pot for your little forest cutie
          and her parents...

          is stealing he'll face consequences.
          Asael is astonished that Tuvia would go against him in public
          and embarrassed by his public drunkenness.

          ASAEL
          What consequences?
          Others are closely watching this test of Tuvia's authority.

          TUVIA

          Tuvia, I would never--

          TUVIA
          Yes. I know.

          ASAEL
          Then why am I to be punished...?
          Tuvia just takes another swallow from his bottle.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          Fischer is with them. So is Levine.
          On food missions, they take first
          for themselves and only bring back
          what's left over--
          Tuvia's head is throbbing. He closes his eyes.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          --and they spread rumors, that you
          are power-hungry and corrupt, that
          you take whatever woman you choose--

          Asael looks at him. No longer the brother he once idealized.

          TUVIA emerges from his bunker. The first thing he sees is
          Asael, whose face is BATTERED AND SWOLLEN.

          TUVIA
          What happened?
          Asael just looks over at the food line -- where Arkady has
          grabbed Chaya by the waist -- to the delight of the others.

          You are no longer Commander. Sorry.
          Tuvia nods, considering his remark for a moment.

          AND THEN TAKES OUT HIS PISTOL AND SHOOTS ARKADY IN THE CHEST!
          He then turns the gun on Motl and the others -- they
          literally cower in fear. He raises his voice to those

          Take his body into the woods and
          leave it for the wolves.

          When we get out of this forest I am
          going to eat only cake and grow as

          Tamara appears. She's wearing a long overcoat.

          I've kept it hidden for months but
          now it's obvious. No one can know.
          They move away from the others. Tamara shows her.

          LILKA
          ..Who is the father?

          TAMARA
          I--- It was when I was escaping. A
          man with a gun stopped me. I thought
          he was a Partisan. He told me to
          follow him and he took me to this
          place...
          The memory overwhelms her. She begins to break down.

          TAMARA (CONT'D)
          Inside me something broke....I wanted
          to die. Every night I have
          nightmares -- what will happen when
          Tuvia finds out.

          LILKA
          He will understand.

          TAMARA
          No. You mustn't tell him!

          LILKA
          I won't. Don't worry.
          (touches her arm)
          What are you going to do?
          Tamara's eyes fill with a new resolve.

          TAMARA
          I feel this new life inside me.
          It's the only thing keeping me going.
          I won't give it up, I'll kill myself.
          Lilka puts her arm around her.

          131A IN THE DEEP FOREST -- ARON IS OUT HUNTING 131A
          From his belt hang the pelts of two dead rabbits.
          He hears A SOUND. Three GERMAN SOLDIERS are putting
          camouflage on their helmets. Beyond, A GERMAN ARMORED
          COLUMN. The assault is coming.

          Tuvia stands peering out into the forest. Asael joins him.

          ASAEL
          Lazar spotted another patrol.
          They're getting closer.
          Tuvia nods. Suddenly, he HEARS a strange sound. An animal?

          TUVIA
          Do you hear that?

          134 IN THE WOMEN'S ZEMYLANKA 134
          We HEAR the SOUND for what it is... The cry of a newborn.
          A baby boy in this mud manger. Riva and Lilka have assisted.
          Tamara holds her new baby to her breast.
          Suddenly -- the blanket serving as a door is SWEPT ASIDE.
          TUVIA stands there. Tamara cries out and shields the baby.
          Lilka springs up and pushes him back outside.

          135 OUTSIDE THE BUNKER 135
          Tuvia walks angrily. Lilka keeps up.

          LILKA
          She promises not to take extra
          food...

          TUVIA
          This is against my orders.

          LILKA
          So you are going to shoot her, too?
          Tuvia stares at her. He has never seen this side of her.

          LILKA (CONT'D)
          Please, Tuvia. The baby is all she
          has to live for.

          TUVIA
          I cannot keep the living alive.
          Tamara and the man who fathered
          this child are responsible for its
          fate.

          LILKA
          She was raped by the Nazis.
          Tuvia closes his eyes. He is tired of being in charge,
          tired of being the arbiter of other peoples' fate.

          LILKA (CONT'D)
          ...You tell us to hold onto our
          humanity. Not to become like
          animals. What better way than by
          bringing a life into this world of
          suffering and death. It's our only
          hope.
          Tuvia is undone by her intensity. The very nearness of
          her. The smell of her newly-washed hair. The glow of her
          skin.
          He looks at her. And nods in surrender.

          LILKA (CONT'D)
          Thank you, Tuvia.
          She kisses him. A chaste kiss of gratitude.
          She pulls back and they look into each other's eyes.
          The next kiss is something entirely different.

          TUVIA

          LILKA

          The Germans are coming into the
          forest. I don't know what is going
          to become of us.

          LILKA
          It doesn't matter. If I had stayed
          in the ghetto I'd be dead. You
          saved my life.

          TUVIA
          No. You have saved mine.
          He reaches for her but before they can begin to make love
          again-- THE BLANKET DOOR IS PUSHED ASIDE. Malbin is there.

          137 A GERMAN SS SCOUT, HANDS TIED BEHIND HIS BACK 137
          is led into the clearing. He wears the same uniform as

          execution.

          ASAEL
          He's a scout.

          TUVIA
          They're coming for us.
          Group members have begun to gather around him. They begin
          to hurl insults -- schtik drek, paskudnyak -- as the hapless
          man is pushed to his knees.

          ASAEL
          We found this in his pouch.
          He hands Tuvia a sheaf of documents -- including a map.

          their faces. Only months ago they were decorous, civilized.
          Now they are hungry, almost feral. Murderous.
          Bella has been silently watching. She steps into the circle,
          looks down at the terrified German man.

          My son's name was David. David

          She swings with all her might. The others watch with a mix
          of thrilled horror and perverse delight. A line has been
          crossed. Riva steps forward, holding a large shovel.

          RIVA
          My sister's name was Ellie...
          As she swings the shovel, the CAMERA begins to back away.

          Tuvia closes his eyes. He has done nothing to stop it.
          Asael looks at Malbin and Shimon. They are undone by what
          they have witnessed. Tuvia walks away.
          Behind them, the group separates -- staring at the lifeless
          body on the ground. And then they look at each other, their
          blood lust sated, beginning to reckon with what they have
          done. What they have become.

          138 TUVIA STANDS ALONE IN THE FOREST, HIS FACE IN SHADOW 138
          He sees Aron, squatting beside a tree, crying silently.

          Tuvia and Viktor walk into the woods. Zus waits with other
          BODYGUARDS as Asael joins them. Zus wears a Nazi jacket.

          ZUS
          He doesn't look good.

          ASAEL
          I could say the same about you.
          Where'd you get the jacket?

          ZUS
          Let's just say the former owner no
          longer had need of it.
          Zus winks. The other bodyguards stare impassively.

          ZUS (CONT'D)

          VIKTOR
          My orders are to take command of
          all partisan operations. You will
          bring the rest of your fighters to
          me.

          TUVIA
          And the others? Old people, women
          and children.

          VIKTOR
          In war there are casualties.

          TUVIA
          And if I refuse?

          VIKTOR
          You are officially a deserter. Do
          you know the policy on dealing with
          deserters?
          Viktor unfolds a paper flyer from his pocket.

          VIKTOR (CONT'D)
          ...The Germans are offering fifty
          thousand marks for information
          leading to your capture.
          (hands it to him)
          Not a very flattering likeness.
          Too Jewish.
          Viktor rejoins his bodyguards, turns back for a last word.

          VIKTOR (CONT'D)
          Have your men in my camp by tonight.
          He walks off. Asael takes the wanted poster from Tuvia.

          ASAEL
          I wouldn't show this around. There
          are some who'd turn you in for less.

          CUT TO:

          141 LATER - A SPOTTER PLANE BUZZES HIGH ABOVE - HUNTING 141
          Down below, Viktor and the Russian partisans have struck
          their tents and hidden beneath the sheltering trees.
          Viktor's gaze follows the plane. He gives an order into a
          field radio. Zus has been listening.

          141 CONTINUED: 141

          ZUS
          You want them to find Tuvia's camp.
          Viktor just looks at him.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          You're deliberately sacrificing
          them so we can remain safe?

          VIKTOR
          No. So we can keep fighting.
          Everyone must sacrifice in the
          struggle.

          ZUS
          Those are my brothers.

          VIKTOR
          I am your brother! He is your
          brother! Comrade Zus. Your Jewish
          sentimentality is heart-warming,
          but counter-revolutionary.
          Zus has secretly known he would hear these words. He grips
          his rifle but holds his tongue.

          BACK TO:

          142 THE SPOTTER PLANE -- FLIES OVER THE BIELSKI CAMP 142
          Tuvia stares up at it. Have they been spotted?
          Shimon is sitting nearby with a group of children. He looks
          pale. His cough is worse. He is very ill.

          SHIMON
          ...but the children of Israel were
          afraid to leave Egypt. Until Moses
          said, 'Do not trust in me, trust in
          God.' He will take care of you'
          (a wrenching cough)
          And so tomorrow we celebrate the
          Passover by sitting around and
          arguing just as we have done for
          centuries.
          Tuvia stares at them, a curious expression on his face.
          Malbin comes to stand beside him.

          MALBIN
          (looking at the plane)
          Did it see us?

          142 CONTINUED: 142

          TUVIA
          Tomorrow is Passover. Yes?

          MALBIN
          ...How should I know?

          TUVIA
          Moses. The Exodus.
          Malbin doesn't get it at first.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          --He left before Pharaoh could stop
          them.
          Now Malbin understands. He looks at Shimon.

          MALBIN
          You want to move them all? The
          old, the sick. They'll never make
          it.
          It isn't the first time Tuvia has consigned people to their
          death, and apparently it won't be the last.

          TUVIA
          We leave now. Spread the word.

          143 MOMENTS LATER - THE BIELSKI CAMP 143
          is a blur of activity as everyone mobilizes for evacuation.
          Sacks and cooking equipment is tied onto impromptu packs.
          Asael and Malbin coax the older people into motion--

          ASAEL
          Come, tateh--

          OPPENHEIM
          But my tools--
          The SOUND of approaching aircraft. Tuvia searches the sky.
          Riva pairs each of the elderly with a child. Tamara tucks
          her newborn under her coat.
          The SOUND of the approaching aircraft grows LOUDER. People
          look up, shielding their eyes. Then from out of the sun,
          two ominous silhouettes:

          STUKA DIVE BOMBERS!

          TUVIA

          TAKE COVER!

          144 THE SCREAMING WHISTLE OF THE FIRST BOMBER 144
          panics the crowd.

          144 CONTINUED: 144
          Some race into the forest; others are frozen. Tuvia grabs
          people and bodily drags them to cover.
          STRAFING 20MM CANNON chew up the ground.
          Several people are hit before they can reach cover. Lilka
          herds everyone she can into:

          145 A BUNKER 145
          where people crowd in like sardines. Chaya and Riva gather
          children around them. They hear the WHISTLE of an incoming
          shell....BOOM! Dirt from the roof rains down on them.

          146 BOMBS BEGIN TO RAIN DOWN 146
          Dirt and debris everywhere. AN INCENDIARY SHELL HITS high
          in a tree. Its branches burst into flame.
          An hysterical woman leaps out of a bunker and is BLOWN APART.

          147 MEANWHILE - IN VIKTOR'S CAMP 147
          Zus listens helplessly to the distant sound of bombs dropping
          on his brothers.

          148 BACK IN THE BIELSKI CAMP - A DIRECT HIT ON A ZEMYLANKA 148
          It explodes into a million pieces. Wood shrapnel everywhere.
          Where once was a bunker, now there is only a gaping crater.
          Tuvia races into the maelstrom to help the wounded.

          AN EXPLOSION KNOCKS HIM DOWN
          He tries to clear his head but he cannot focus. ALL SOUND
          FADES AWAY to be replaced by a high-pitched hum.

          149 TUVIA'S WORLD IS IN SLOW-MOTION 149
          Falling dirt and debris, tumbling bodies, exploding bunkers --
          a surreal effect.

          150 IN REAL TIME -- THE CAMP IS BEING TORN APART 150
          Cowering in safety, Malbin sees Tuvia lying in the open and
          gathers his courage -- RACING through danger to his side.

          MALBIN
          Are you alright?
          Tuvia shakes his head, points to his ears. He cannot hear.

          MALBIN (CONT'D)

          ARE...YOU...ALRIGHT?
          When Tuvia speaks, his WORDS sound DULL and MUFFLED.

          TUVIA

          MUST...GO!

          MALBIN

          ...WHAT?

          TUVIA

          THE GERMANS...COMING...!
          Malbin looks around, panicked. Asael appears out of the
          smoke, yells at Malbin above the din.

          ASAEL
          Get them out of the bunkers!
          Malbin runs off. Asael helps Tuvia to his feet. A nearby
          explosion SHOWERS THEM with dirt as they CRAWL to safety.
          The world RAMPS BACK TO NORMAL SPEED at a dizzying rate.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          We need to hold them off...until
          the rest are safe.
          Tuvia still can't hear. Asael pantomimes firing a rifle.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)

          ...HOLD...THEM...OFF!
          Tuvia nods, trying to clear the buzzing in his head.

          TUVIA

          ...MACHINE GUN...

          ASAEL
          With Levine and Miriam... There.
          (points out positions)
          Lazar, Rosa, and Schmuel. There
          and there.
          (Tuvia nods)
          And me.
          Tuvia shakes his head, no.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          Yes.
          He runs off. Still clearing his head, Tuvia regains his
          footing -- suddenly realizing the the bombing has stopped.

          151 AT THE ENTRY WAY TO A ZEMYLANKA 151
          Malbin appears, eyes wild.

          MALBIN
          Everybody out! Now!
          But the group's natural reaction is to stay huddled in safety

          MALBIN (CONT'D)

          THE COSSACKS ARE COMING!
          This gets the job done. People begin to crawl out.

          152 OTHERS EMERGE FROM THE BUNKERS 152
          YOUNG PEOPLE holding hands with OLD, PARENTS with CHILDREN
          on their backs. Tuvia urges Lilka and Bella to hurry them
          into the woods.

          153 MEANWHILE -- THE ASSIGNED DEFENDERS, MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE 153
          take up their assigned positions: Levine mans the heavy
          machine gun behind a log; Lazar, Miriam and Rosa in the
          trees.
          Tuvia anxiously waits for the last of the women and children
          to disappear into the forest.

          A SUDDEN SILENCE DESCENDS - EVERYONE LOOKS TO THE SKY
          Tuvia realizes the bombers have broken off their attack.
          He knows the ground troops will soon follow.
          He turns to Asael, grabbing his shoulders.

          TUVIA
          Don't try to fight... Just slow
          them down. Then join us.
          Asael nods. No need for more words. They embrace fiercely.
          Asael pushes Chaya toward Tuvia.

          ASAEL
          Take her.
          She resists, clinging to his arm for a moment.

          TUVIA
          Come.
          He forces her to join him and catch up to the others.

          154 THE CAMP 154
          is eerily quiet as the dust begins to settle. The defenders
          check their weapons with grim efficiency. They are no longer
          inept innocents; they have become warriors.

          155 DEEPER IN THE WOODS 155
          Tuvia catches up with the fleeing group and urges them on.

          156 MOMENTS LATER -- THE DEFENDERS WAIT ANXIOUSLY 156
          We study their faces. Beautiful in their stoic acceptance.

          SUDDENLY -- A FUSILLADE from the woods. Rosa falls dead.
          The defenders RETURN FIRE. Levine fires the machine gun;
          Miriam feeds the belt.

          157 UP AHEAD WITH THE FLEEING GROUP 157
          Tuvia hears small arms fire. He knows what it means.

          158 BACK AT THE CAMP 158
          The rear guard action can't hold out for very long. Tree
          by tree, they begin to fall back.
          Asael fires blindly into the murky shadows. The SOUND of a
          man crying out.
          Then Levine is hit. Miriam pushes him out of the way and
          TAKES OVER. She expertly kills several assault troops who
          appear out of the woods.
          The rest of the attackers TAKE COVER.

          159 WITH THE FLEEING GROUP 159
          Malbin waits anxiously for Tuvia, clutching a map.

          MALBIN
          (struggling to control
          his panic)
          This swamp here...goes...for miles.

          TUVIA
          Show me.

          160 BACK AT THE CAMP 160
          Lazar runs from tree to tree, keeping up a steady stream of
          fire. He is surprisingly brave. Until A GRENADE flies out
          of the woods and lands at his feet, killing him instantly.
          The Assault Troops have begun to outflank them. Asael is
          suddenly in jeopardy. Sara sees the danger.

          MIRIAM

          GO!
          Miriam keeps their ATTACKERS pinned down as the two men
          race for new positions. Then she is hit. She keeps firing
          anyway, her finger locked on the trigger even as she is
          dying.
          More troops begin firing from their flank. Asael has no
          choice but to break off. They race into the woods.

          161 BACK TO THE FLEEING GROUP 161
          Tuvia hears the guns go silent. This, too, has meaning.

          162 A RISE REVEALS THE IMMENSITY OF THE KRASNAYA GORKA SWAMP 162
           Malbin stares at what lies ahead.

          TUVIA
          Are the others back yet?
          (Malbin looks
          stricken; he shakes
          his head)
          ..Asael?
          Malbin shakes his head once more. Asael is not coming back.
          Chaya begins to weep. Riva comforts her.

          SHULMAN
          We've got to keep going!

          BELLA
          The Germans will be here any minute!

          MALBIN
          (to Tuvia)
          Do we wait...a while?

          MORDECAI
          We could hide...

          MAN #3
          I say, fight them here.

          MOTL
          Yes. Fight!

          SHULMAN
          That's crazy!
          Tuvia is in hell. If he waits for Asael, he risks them all
          being caught. Suddenly it all falls apart. Tuvia sinks to
          his knees as if his legs can no longer bear his weight.

          MALBIN
          Tuvia--?
          Tuvia can't speak. He has no more answers. Nothing to
          say. He stares at the impenetrable swamp. The end of the
          line.
          The sudden vacuum of leadership is felt by them all. They
          stare at one another, anxious and rudderless.

          WOMAN (ZOE)
          My father cannot make it.

          RONA
          There are snakes--
          Tamara's newborn is crying. She tries to comfort it. An
          old woman stares at the swamp in terror.

          MAN #1 (FROHMAN)
          The children...

          SHULMAN
          We'll put them on our shoulders.

          Oppenheim is petrified. Rona is crying.

          MALBIN

          TUVIA--
          And still Tuvia is silent.
          More arguing. A general MURMUR of dread is rising.
          Malbin goes to kneel beside Shimon, who is covered in sweat --
          undone by the forced march.

          MALBIN (CONT'D)
          What's wrong with him?

          SHIMON
          (fighting for breath)
          ...He... ..is... ..tired.
          Malbin hears something, looks up.

          FROM HIGH ABOVE - THE SPOTTER PLANE APPEARS
          They have been found. Lilka kneels beside Tuvia.

          She takes his hand silently.

          LILKA

          COME--
          He shakes his head.

          TUVIA
          You have a weapon?
          She shows him her revolver. He checks the clip, then looks
          into her eyes.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Use it on yourself before you let
          them take you.
          She nods gravely. Suddenly a VOICE interrupts.

          VOICE
          Why are we stopping?
          Everyone turns. It's Asael. Back from the dead. He hands
          off a wounded comrade to Riva's care.

          ASAEL

          (WILD-EYED)
          They're coming!
          (to Tuvia)
          Why aren't we moving?
          Tuvia looks up at him, lost. Almost helpless.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          We must keep going!

          TAMARA
          In there?

          RONA
          It is impossible!
          More murmuring. Asael raises his voice.

          ASAEL
          Nothing is impossible! What we
          have done is impossible!
          The murmuring quiets.
          Asael meets Tuvia's eyes. He is literally willing his older
          brother to be strong for them, as he has been, time and

          Take the rope from your pack.
          (confused; he obeys)
          Now, you....give me your belt.

          SHULMAN
          We don't have enough rope.

          ASAEL
          We'll link arms. Make a chain. A
          human chain.

          MOTL
          What are you talking about?
          Tuvia is deeply moved. His little brother has become a
          man. Once more, he finds his voice.

          TUVIA
          Each person takes care of the other.
          (meeting Asael's eye)
          .Give him your belt.
          Asael nods at Tuvia gratefully. The group is hushed,
          apprehensive. Then:

          ONE MAN
          Removes his belt and offers it to Asael.

          ANOTHER STANDS, HOLDING HIS BELT
          And then another. One by one they offer them. There is
          something quietly heroic in the gesture.
          Tuvia looks at the group, looks away, fighting back emotion.

          TUVIA
          No tracks on land. Get back in.
          It is almost impossible to make any progress. Especially
          when one is weak and malnourished.

          162C IN A DEEP BOG 162C
          The mud sticks to their clothes, faces. Soon they are
          indistinguishable from their surroundings.
          When one person sinks in the muck, it takes three to get
          him back on his feet. The column slows.
          Tuvia gestures for them to keep moving. They can't.
          Literally cannot. He begins to physically push them on.
          Sometimes harshly. Eventually they are moving again.

          CUT TO:

          163 A GHOSTLY LANDSCAPE 163
          Gnarled bare trees shrouded in mist. They trudge forward,
          their expressions wan and empty. Tuvia find Malbin and
          pulls him aside.

          TUVIA

          (WHISPERING)
          How much farther?
          Malbin shrugs his shoulders. Who knows...?

          163A THE WATER IS ALMOST HEAD HIGH 163A
          Parents hoist children onto their shoulders, hold weapons
          overhead as they claw at tall reeds to propel themselves
          forward, step by tortuous step.
          SHIMON clings to a tree. His wracking cough is terrifying
          and he is deathly pale.

          TUVIA
          Come...
          Shimon can't catch his breath, he just shakes his head, no.
          He can't go on. Tuvia half-drags, half-carries him onward.

          They rest, eat what little food is left. A litter carrying
          Shimon is deposited on dry ground. He is barely alive.

          MALBIN
          Is he...?
          Tuvia shakes his head. It's only a matter of time. The
          Spotter Plane drones overhead.

          TUVIA
          Take off your glasses. Reflections.
          Tuvia moves off to check on the others.

          MALBIN
          Shimon, listen to me, the physical
          plane is just an illusion. Only
          the spiritual plane is real.

          SHIMON
          (fighting for breath)
          No. The physical plane is where
          man acts to redeem himself.

          MALBIN
          You've redeemed yourself enough,
          you should shut up now.

          SHIMON
          Look who's talking about shutting
          up... I need to tell you something.

          MALBIN
          (leans closer)
          What is it?

          SHIMON
          You shouldn't think so much. The
          world around you is beautiful.

          MALBIN
          (stunned; looks around)
          This world?

          SHIMON
          Even this one.
          Tuvia has come to sit beside Lilka. She leans into him.

          TUVIA
          We're lost.

          LILKA
          No. ..No.
          She puts her arms around him.

          The LIGHTS of their fire can be seen flickering through the
          reeds as the ragged column MOVES SILENTLY past.

          TUVIA
          Not a sound. Pass the word.
          We watch as the ORDER is passed down the line.
          Parents hold hands over their childrens' mouths. Shimon is

          Panchenko and a few others are on horseback. Behind them

          Zus and the Jewish fighters are on foot, awaiting orders.

          PANCHENKO
          You will hold this crossroads until
          the brigade has completed its
          retreat.
          Zus looks around at the position.

          ZUS
          For how long?
          Panchenko's orders are never to be questioned.

          PANCHENKO
          Until you are ordered to withdraw.

          ZUS
          And if we cannot hold the position?
          Panchenko looks at Gramov, who stands nearby cradling a
          submachine gun.

          PANCHENKO
          Comrade Gramov will enforce
          discipline, if necessary.
          Gramov smiles. The implications are clear: nobody retreats.

          PANCHENKO (CONT'D)
          You have served us well, Comrade.

          ZUS
          (a wintry smile)
          I am so honored, Comrade.
          Panchenko wheels his horse and gallops off. Zus and his
          men take cover in the woods.
          In the distance we can HEAR the unmistakable SOUND of
          approaching armor. Lova kneels beside Zus.

          LOVA
          What are we doing here? Zus?
          Half a mile down the road, A TANK rumbles into view.

          LOVA (CONT'D)
          Tell me. Who are we doing this
          for?
          With a shaking hand, Zus tries to light a Molotov cocktail
          but his matches are wet. He reaches into his pocket for
          more. Instead he finds the mezuzah that was once affixed to
          his family's door.
          As he stares at it, the SOUND of the approaching tank grows
          louder.

          169 ON THE OPPOSITE BANK 169
          Asael pulls people up onto dry ground. They lie there,
          freezing and exhausted. Some cannot control their shivering.

          SHULMAN
          What's next...Sinai?
          Tuvia can't help but laugh. Soon they are all laughing.
          It ripples throughout the group. Joyous. Contagious. An
          overwhelming feeling of relief.
          They are safe.
          Tuvia lies on the ground. All the adrenaline has suddenly
          left his body. Then Aron appears, tugging at his sleeve.
          Shimon is asking for him.
          Tuvia kneels down beside his teacher, whose eyes are closed.
          Malbin is weeping quietly. Who will he argue with?

          SHIMON

          .Tuvia...

          I know... ... But just...in case... .I
          thank....HIM... .and I thank you.
          He closes his eyes.
          It's too much for Tuvia. Hard as he tries, he cannot stop
          the tears from filling his eyes.

          170 SUDDENLY -- UP THE RIVERBANK 170
          Trees begin to FALL OVER -- as if pushed by a dinosaur.

          A PANZER TANK
          emerges onto the banks, less than a quarter-of-mile away.

          ITS TURRET BEGINS TO SWIVEL
          The menacing gun turning in their direction.

          171 THE GROUP IS CAUGHT OUT IN THE OPEN. 171
          THE TANK ROARS FIRE. The first round EXPLODES among them.
          Several are killed.

          TUVIA
          Back to the river!
          He pushes people down. They cling to the banks, cowering.
          THOSE WITH WEAPONS take cover, using the embankment as if
          it were the lip of a trench.
          They RETURN FIRE -- old men, young women, even some children.

          172 A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY ADVANCES 172
          behind the tank, using it as protection.
          Aron kills one. But the Germans are well-trained. They
          direct a withering fire -- forcing the partisans to keep
          their heads below the embankment.

          BUT THE TANK IS UNSTOPPABLE
          It turns its attentions on the riverbank -- its first round
          SAILS OVERHEAD, sending up a huge geyser of water.
          But the next round PLOWS INTO THE EARTH, tearing a huge
          chunk of earth and killing two of the brigade.
          TUVIA grabs a satchel and begins filling it with grenades.
          He throws the satchel over Malbin's head, grabs his arm and
          races, crouching low, beneath the lip of the riverbank.
          Asael provides covering fire. So do Lilka, Chaya and the
          women alongside the men.

          UP AHEAD
          A stand of trees hides Tuvia from view as he climbs out of
          the river and heads into the forest. He pulls Malbin down
          just as A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY approaches and begins to
          set up a heavy machine gun.

          Tuvia POPS UP behind them, spraying them with his submachine
          gun. He then turns the heavy machine gun on the infantry
          advancing behind the tank -- to devastating effect.
          But now, the tank turns its attention to Tuvia. Its machine
          gun begins to chew up the forest, forcing Tuvia to take
          cover.
          Without pausing to think, Malbin grabs a grenade from the
          satchel and races toward the tank.
          It falls pitifully short, exploding harmlessly as Malbin is
          cut down.

          Bullets tear chunks out of trees as he tries to take cover.

          THE TURRET SWIVELS IN HIS DIRECTION
          It is only a matter of moments before he is dead.

          WHEN SUDDENLY FROM OUT OF THE WOODS
          Zus and the rest of Jewish fighters emerge, firing on the
          run. Without regard for his own life, Zus charges.
          The German infantry is caught in a cross-fire as the Bielski
          brigade climbs out the river, firing wildly.
          Zus guns down the tank commander manning the machine gun
          from the open hatch. Jumps onto the tank and DROPS A GRENADE
          inside. An EXPLOSION of BLACK SMOKE BILLOWS.
          Zus stands up amid the billowing smoke. He sees Tuvia who
          is staring back at him.

          174 BOTH GROUPS MEET - THE DESTROYED TANK SMOLDERS NEARBY 174
          Asael is the first to reach Tuvia, who is carrying the German
          assault machine gun.

          TUVIA
          Only weapons and ammunition! Spread
          the word.
          Tuvia hands him the machine gun.

          ASAEL
          Anything else?
          Tuvia looks at him. Is he fucking with him? Just a little.

          TUVIA
          Go on.
          Lilka is carrying a small child.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Lilka, please help. We've got to
          get the injured into the forest.

          What about the dead?

          TUVIA
          Everybody gather your things! We
          have to get out of the open!
          Nearby, Aron removes the machine from the tank and hands it
          to Zus. Bella approaches. Zus embraces her.
          Tuvia seizes one of the German rifles. He yells to Shulman.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)

          Bella the machine gun from the tank and approaches.

          Where is the rest of your unit?

          ZUS

          You are going back?

          ZUS

          it.

          TUVIA
          We've got to build a new camp.

          Tuvia reaches out his arms and they embrace fiercely.

          They walk in silence. Lilka comes to walk beside him,
          resting her head on his shoulder as they walk.
          Tuvia looks up at the shafts of light slanting through the
          towering trees, as if allowing himself to appreciate its
          beauty for the first time.
          Suddenly, he stops, listening, puzzled.

          TUVIA
          Don't you hear it?

          ZUS
          What...?

          TUVIA

          But for now he allows himself a brief moment of satisfaction.
          We might even see the ghost of a smile. But it is short-
          lived as Asael appears by his side and we see concern once
          again clouding his face. Another problem to attend to.
          And as THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL AWAY he is already hurrying
          to catch up with the others.
          As they all disappear from sight into the sheltering darkness
          of the woods, these words appear on screen:

          THEY LIVED IN THE FOREST FOR TWO MORE YEARS.

          IN THEIR NEW CAMP THEY BUILT A SCHOOL, A HOSPITAL, A NURSERY.

          AND STILL MORE CAME TO FIND THEM.

          AT THE TIME OF LIBERATION, TWELVE HUNDRED WALKED OUT OF THE

          FOREST.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          176 THE OPENING SCENE - NEW YORK CITY - 1982 176
          Park Avenue. Traffic. More words on screen:

          ASAEL JOINED THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND DIED SIX MONTHS LATER.

          ZUS AND TUVIA EMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES.
          In the taxi, THE ELDERLY MAN thrusts his hand through the
          slot in the Plexiglas window separating him from the driver.

          ELDERLY MAN
          Here is money. I can get more. So
          much more. Take it, please.

          CAB DRIVER
          No, no...
          Indeed, when the CABBIE speaks, though the voice is older
          and somewhat frail, we recognize it as Tuvia's.

          ELDERLY MAN
          What else can I give you, do for
          you?

          AGED TUVIA
          Nothing, it isn't necessary.
          Tears stream down the elderly man's cheeks.

          ELDERLY MAN
          We are alive because of you.
          (looks at his son)
          My children. His children. So many.
          .Thousands.

          (CONTINUED)

          

          

          

          
           DOUBLE CHERRY Revision - 11-1-07 111.

          176 CONTINUED: 176
          Behind them, HORNS are HONKING. This is New York City.

          AGED TUVIA
          Please, the traffic...

          ELDERLY MAN
          Bless you, Tuvia Bielski. May the
          Lord bless you and keep you all the
          days of your life.

          THE CAB PULLS AWAY FROM THE CURB INTO THE RAIN -

          MIDDLE-AGED SON
          Papa, who was that man?
          The Elderly Man watches the cab pull away, wiping his eyes.

          ELDERLY MAN
          That wasn't a man. That was an
          angel.
          As the cab pulls away, the CAMERA CRANES UP until it is
          lost in an anonymous sea of traffic. These words appear on

          SCREEN:

          TUVIA BIELSKI NEVER SOUGHT RECOGNITION FOR WHAT HE DID.

          HE DROVE A CAB IN NEW YORK CITY FOR TWENTY YEARS.

          TUVIA AND LILKA REMAINED MARRIED UNTIL HIS DEATH IN 1987.

          FADE OUT.
