     SISTER ACT

     FADE IN:

     INT. ST. ANNE'S ACADEMY - AKRON, OHIO - CLASSROOM
     We are in a parochial school classroom, in the late 
     Sixties.  The children all wear uniforms and sit at little 
     desks.  SISTER IMMACULATA stands at the front of the room; 
     she is a middle-aged nun, very severe.  The children are 
     all terrified of her.

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
               Who can name all the Apostles?  Yes?

     ANGLE ON CHRISTINE CARTER

     A thirteen-year-old girl sitting at a desk.  She raises 
     her hand.

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
               Christine?

                               CHRISTINE
               Sister, may I be excused?

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
               Christine...

                               CHRISTINE
               It's an emergency.  Real bad.

     Sister Immaculata nods, pursing her lips.  Christine 
     stands and heads for the door.

     
                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. GIRLS ROOM

     Christine is now in the deserted St. Anne's girls room. 
     She is standing on tiptoes, looking in the mirror.  She has 
     taken her hair out of its neat barrettes; she is combing it 
     out.  She applies lipstick.

     Christine reaches into her schoolbag; she pulls out a 
     stack of glittery bracelets and slips them on.  She 
     unbuttons the top few buttons of her stiff white blouse.  
     She sprays herself with dime store cologne.

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. HALLWAY

     Christine opens the girls' room door; she looks both ways.  
     No one is around; she saunters down the hall.

     Page 2.

     ANGLE ON A DOOR MARKED BROOM CLOSET
     Christine opens this door.  She looks into the closet. 
     There is a very nervous thirteen-year-old BOY waiting for 
     her inside.

                               CHRISTINE
               Hi, Jimmy.

     Christine slips inside the closet and closes the door 
     behind her.

     ANGLE ON SISTER IMMACULATA

     Striding down the hall, with a bloodthirsty look in her 
     eye, and a nasty-looking wooden ruler in her hand.  She 
     flings open the broom closet door,

     ANGLE ON CHRISTINE AND JIMMY

     in the broom closet.  Jimmy's face is covered with 
     lipstick.  Christine's hair is awry.  The couple has 
     clearly been making out.

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
                             (outraged)
               Miss Christine Carter!  Again!  Don't 
               you know what happens to girls like you?  
               Don't you know what they become?

     INT. CHRISTY'S APARTMENT - ANGLE ON A LARGE, TATTERED 
     POSTER-NIGHT (TODAY)

     Taped over a crack on a wall.  The poster shows a 
     glittering CHRISTY VAN CARTIER:  singing star of a fifth-
     rate Vegas lounge.  Christy wears tight spangles and a 
     major wig on the poster.  She has clearly lived up, or 
     down, to all of Sister Immaculata's expectations.

     The CAMERA PANS through the dark bedroom in which the 
     poster hangs; a neon sign flashes outside the window, 
     casting a red and blue haze over the premises.  A dressing 
     room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail 
     polish and makeup, and garish clothing and flashy jewelry 
     are scattered everywhere.

     We hear the movement of BED SPRINGS as someone sits up in 
     the dark.

                               CHRISTY'S VOICE
               Come on, Vince -- hold me a minute.

                               VINCE'S VOICE
               I'd love to. babe -- but I've got to go.  
               It was great.  Like usual.

                               CHRISTY'S VOICE
               It was twenty minutes.  Like usual.

     Page 3.

                               VINCE'S VOICE
               The best.

     VINCE LAROCCA stands at the mirror, adjusting his clothing 
     and checking his hair.  Vince is a powerful, charismatic 
     man who rules an organized crime empire with personal 
     magnetism and threat.  Vince's hold over Christy is 
     obvious, if unfortunate; he can seem expansive and generous 
     one minute, ruthless and dangerous the next.

                               VINCE
                             (half to Christy, half 
                             to the mirror)
               You are something else.

     Christy turns on a lamp and lights a cigarette.

                               CHRISTY
               Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can 
               talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, 
               we'll have fun.  And you still haven't 
               told me what happened.  What did she say?

                               VINCE
               What did who say?

                               CHRISTY
               Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.

     Vince turns to face Christy, turning on the charm.

                               VINCE
               You are so damn sexy.

                               CHRISTY
               Vince...

                               VINCE
               How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, 
               five years we've been together?  Who do I 
               thank?

                               CHRISTY
                             (not buying it)
               Today was the deadline, Vince.

     Vince sits on the bed.  He takes Christy's hand, and 
     kisses it.

                               VINCE
               I want us to be together.  Like people.  
               Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of 
               God.  Babe, today... I went to 
               confession.

                               CHRISTY
               You did what?

     Page 4.

                               VINCE
               For the first time in I don't know how 
               long.  I wanted everything done right. 
               Open and above board.  I told Father 
               Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it 
               was a special love, for all the ages.

                               CHRISTY
                             (starting to fall for 
                             it)
               You said that?  And what did he say?  
               Did he say you could leave her?  Did he 
               say we'd be happy?

                               VINCE
                             (looking deep into her 
                             eyes)
               He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn 
               in Hell.  For all eternity.

     Vince kisses Christy's hands again and drops turns away 
     and starts putting on his shoes.

                               CHRISTY
               What?
                             (outraged)

                               VINCE
               You want me to go against a priest?  Get 
               excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?

                               CHRISTY
               You bastard!

                               VINCE
                             (trying to calm her)
               We can still see each other.  Just like 
               always.  It's a different kind of sin. 
               Smaller.

                               CHRISTY
               You pig!

     Vince backs off, and starts searching for his jacket.

                               VINCE
               Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's 
               God!

                               CHRISTY
               You lying sleazeball!  The best years of 
               my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?

     Vince ducks as Christy throws an ashtray at him, and it 
     smashes against the wall.

                               VINCE
               You're upset.  I understand.  I should 
               go.  I hate to.

     Page 5.

     A CLOCK-RADIO hits the wall beside Vince's head.

                               CHRISTY
               Get out of here!  And never come back!

     A LAMP hits the wall, as Vince dodges it.  He makes a 
     phone gesture with his hand.

                               VINCE
               I'll call.

     Vince kisses two fingers, and blows the kiss to Christy. 
     He leaves.

     Christy is left standing on the bed, holding a 
     particularly garish stuffed animal she was about to hurl.  
     With Vince gone she slumps to the bed, cradling the stuffed 
     animal. She is caught between tears and rage.

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

     ANGLE on various neon Vegas landmarks -- the Golden 
     Nugget, Caesar's Palace, Bally's, etc.  Scrunched in 
     between two larger hotels and casinos is the MOONLIGHT 
     HOTEL AND CASINO.  The Moonlight isn't all that small, it's 
     just seen better days.

     INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

     A spotlight hits a solitary figure on a small stage.  The 
     man is caped and dramatic, but not especially talented; an 
     Elvis impersonator who's just a shade off in voice, looks 
     and style.

                               ELVIS
               Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Are 
               you lonesome tonight?  Welcome to the 
               Moonlight Hotel and Casino's incredible 
               Platinum Oldies Spectacular.

     Backstage, there's still a look of resolve in Christy's 
     eye as she waits to go on with MICHELLE and TINA, her back-
     up singers.

                               MICHELLE
               But you can't quit.  What'll happen to 
               us?
                             (to Tina)
               Tell her she can't quit.

                               TINA
               I told her.  She stuck pantyhose in my 
               mouth.

     Onstage, Elvis glances into the wings to be sure the 
     Ronelles are ready.

     Page 6.

                               ELVIS
               Please welcome our own girl group 
               extraordinaire, our beehives of beauty --
               the fabulous Ronelles!

     Elvis disappears.  The spotlight hits Christy, who wears a 
     high beehive wig and a sequinned, early Supremes-style 
     gown.  Michelle and Tina wear matching gowns and wigs.  The 
     band begins a doo-wop vamp.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, girls.

                               RONELLES
               Yes, Betty?

                               CHRISTY
               This prom is a real drag.

                               RONELLES
               Oh-huh.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh my!
                             (gasping)

                               RONELLES
               What is it, Betty?

                               CHRISTY
               Look at that.  Get a gander.

                               RONELLES
               Oh my!
                             (sighing)

                               CHRISTY
               He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek 
               god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's 
               boss.  He's fab.  He's...

                               RONELLES
               Yes, Betty?

                               CHRISTY
                             (singing)
               HE'S SO FINE.

                               RONELLES
               D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.

                               CHRISTY
               WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY 
               OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.

     As they sing, their moves and gestures are carefully 
     choreographed in vintage girl group style.

     Page 7.

     A lot of talent and hard work has clearly gone into the 
     number.  While Christy does her best, her singing voice is 
     not on a par with those of the other Ronelles.

     The lounge itself is practically empty, except for a few 
     drunken Shriners and a couple of college kids.  POLICE 
     LIEUTENANT EDDIE MULCAHY sits at a ringside table with his 
     eyes locked on Christy.  An easygoing charmer, Eddie gives 
     her a wink, but she responds with an up-yours look and a 
     turn to the other half of the room as the song continues.

     INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

     A small, cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a 
     sputtering fan for ventilation.  Christy has her own 
     dressing table and mirror, and the Ronelles share a table a 
     few feet away.  Clothing and costumes hang on nails or are 
     draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear.

                               CHRISTY
               Screw this dump.  It's a roach motel 
               with sequins.  Every guy I meet is either 
               married, a cop, or a lush from Des 
               Moines.

                               MICHELLE
               But what about us?

                               TINA
               You taught us the act.  The songs, all 
               the moves.

                               CHRISTY
               And where did it get me?  I'm stuck in 
               this rathole!  You're holding me back, 
               just like Vince!  I should be headlining!

     A pock-faced weasel of a man named JOEY opens the door and 
     leans into the room.

                               CHRISTY
               What do you want?  This is a private 
               area!  Get lost!

                               JOEY
               You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.

                               CHRISTY
               Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit 
               the road.

     Joey takes a step into the room and sets a box on the 
     chair near Christy.

                               JOEY
               From Vince.

     Page 8.

                               CHRISTY
               His ashes?

                               JOEY
               With love.

     Joey leaves.  Michelle and Tina hover around the box, very 
     excited.  They pick it up, trying to tempt Christy.

                               MICHELLE
               From Vince! With love!

                               TINA
               Michelle and Tina can't restrain 
               themselves: they open the box.  Inside is 
               a rather gaudy fur coat.  Michelle and 
               Tina are impressed.

                               MICHELLE
               It's a fur!

                               TINA
               It's new!

                               CHRISTY
               It's a bribe.  Five years of my 
               goddamned life!

                               MICHELLE
               So you earned it!

                               TINA
               Vince owns the casino!  Cash in

                               CHRISTY
               I should throw this in his facet

     There's a KNOCK on the door, and Tina opens it.  
     Lieutenant Eddie Mulcahy enters.  Christy is not pleased.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, Jesus.  What is going on here?
                             (to heaven)
               Why me?  Whose dog did I kill?

                               MICHELLE
               Hi, Lieutenant.

                               TINA
               Hello, Eddie.

     Eddie picks up the coat.

                               EDDIE
               From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo-
               lang.

                               CHRISTY
               At least he's not a cop.  At least he 
               can afford a decent gift.

                               EDDIE
               I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your 
               birthday .  When we were seeing each 
               other.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, 
               that your mother picked out?  Lottery 
               tickets?  A travel iron?

                               EDDIE
               So I don't shop.

                               CHRISTY
               'Cause you're always out, arresting 
               people.  Making trouble.  I don't know 
               why I went out with you in the first 
               place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't 
               hold my head up, I used to tell people 
               you were a security guard!

                               EDDIE
               Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt?  
               You were singing in bowling alleys back 
               then.  I told people you were a hooker!

                               MICHELLE
               Calm down, you two.  It's always like 
               this.

                               EDDIE
               Yeah, well, now, she goes out with a' 
               better class of people.  Vince Laflocca.

                               CHRISTY
               He's a businessman.

                               EDDIE
               A what? When are you qonna wake up?

                               CHRISTY
               When are you gonna get off my case?  
               Have you got a search warrant?  What do 
               you want -- cheap thrills?

                               EDDIE
               Information, baby.  I thought maybe 
               somebody around here might have a 
               conscience.

                               CHRISTY
               Think again!  And get out of here.

     Page 10.

                               EDDIE
               I'm going.  My regards to Vince,   And 
               the Mrs.

     Christy hurls a jar of cold cream at Eddie's head.  He 
     ducks, and the jar hits the door.

                               EDDIE
               Ladies.

     Eddie leaves.  Christy is standing, absolutely furious.

                               CHRISTY
               That's it!  I'm not taking it from him, 
               and I'm not taking it from Vince!  From 
               now on, it's all about me!  And if I 
               can't spend it, drink it, or sleep with 
               it -- it's gone.  Like Sister Immaculata 
               used to say, "Life is short, and then you 
               fry."  So long, girls -- see you in 
               church!

     Christy grabs the mink and heads out the door.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     ERNIE SCHMIDT sits across the enormous mahogany desk from 
     Vince.  The young man's throat is dry; he's sweating 
     bullets.  The presence of Joey the weasel and WILLY, a 
     brutal thug, increases Ernie's tension.

                               VINCE
               Ernie Schmidt.  How long you been with 
               us, Ernie Schmidt?

                               ERNIE
               Three years, Mr. LaRocca.  One behind 
               the bar, two as croupier.

     Vince gestures to the lush office and its furnishings.

                               VINCE
               Ernie, you know what's important to me?  
               What counts?  It's not all this.  This is 
               '-- what?  Frosting.  Loyalty.  That's me, 
               Ernie.  That's home.

     Vince gestures to Joey, who takes out a revolver and 
     points it at Ernie's head.

                               VINCE
               You ain't been loyal, Ernie.  What did 
               you tell the cops?

     Ernie's eyes open wide with denial as the gun comes closer 
     to his temple.

     Page 11.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY

     Holding the coat, Christy waits by the elevator.  It 
     arrives; she gets in.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

     The interrogation continues.

                               ERNIE
               I didn't tell the cops anything. I 
               swear.

                               VINCE
               Joey?

     Joey slams Ernie on the side of the head with the gun.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Christy steps out of the elevator and faces a maze of 
     office cubicles with half-wall partitions.  The floor is 
     deserted and dark as she makes her way through the 
     cubicles.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

     Vince is standing over Ernie, holding his head up by the 
     hair.

                               VINCE
               Who else, Ernie?  Who else was in on it?

                               ERNIE
                             (moaning)
               No one...

                               VINCE
                             (dropping Ernie's head 
                             in disgust)
               Why am I wasting my time?

     INT. EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR

     Beyond the cubicles, Christy strides down a lush corridor 
     to an executive suite.  She tries the knob, but finds the 
     door locked.  Pulling a key from her purse, she unlocks the 
     door to the suite and enters a large outer office with a 
     reception area and doors to several inner offices.  She 
     tosses the key onto the receptionist's desk.

                               CHRISTY
               Won't need that anymore.  Ta-ta.

     Crossing to Vince's office, Christy squares her shoulders 
     and narrows her eyes with anger as she reaches for the 
     doorknob.  She pauses for a second, and then doubles her 
     resolve.

     Page 12.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

                               VINCE
               Do it.
                             (to Joey)

     ANGLE on the door to the office, which opens.  Christy 
     appears, with the mink coat in her arms.

                               CHRISTY
               Stuff this up your...

     A GUNSHOT is heard, 0.S.  Christy's eyes widen, and her 
     jaw drops, at what she has just witnessed.

     ANGLE on the office.  Ernie is slumped in the chair, dead. 
     Joey stands over him, holding the revolver.  Joey, Willy 
     and Vince stare at Christy.

                               VINCE
               Babe.
                             (icy calm)

     Christy tries to speak; she can't.

                               VINCE
               Christy.  Is there a problem?  With the 
               coat?

     Christy glances around the room; she doesn't move.  She 
     quickly sizes up the situation.  She tries to appear 
     matter-of-fact. unaffected by what she's just seen.

                               CHRISTY
               No... it's fine. 

                               VINCE
               Yes?

                               CHRISTY
               Thanks.  A lot.

                               VINCE
               Is that why you came up here, Christy? 
               To thank me?

                               CHRISTY
               Sure.

                               VINCE
               And to say you're sorry.  About this 
               afternoon.  And the things you said. 
               Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you 
               understand?  Forgotten.

                               CHRISTY
                             (catching the subtext)
               Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.

     Page 13.

     Vince crosses the room, to Christy.  He takes her hands in 
     his, and kisses them.

                               VINCE
               That's my girl.  My girl in mink.  Will 
               you be home?  Soon?

     Christy kisses Vince, quickly.

                               CHRISTY
               Right.  I'll be... at the apartment.  
               Call me.  Thanks.  Again.

     Christy reaches for the doorknob, without looking at the 
     door.  She fumbles a bit.  She finds the door.

                               CHRISTY
               Mink.  Wow.

     Christy walks backwards, out the door.  She turns; she is 
     gone.

                               JOEY
               Vince -- is she... okay?

                               VINCE
               Maybe.
                             (considering this)

                               WILLY
               I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind 
               of upset.

                               VINCE
               She did.
                             (making a decision)
               Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.

                               JOEY 
               And if she runs? 

                               VINCE
                             (icy)
               Take care of it.

     With guns drawn, Willy and Joey run after Christy.

     INT. RECEPTION AREA

     Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from 
     Vince's office.  She passes through a glass door which 
     leads to the cubicle area.

     LONG SHOT of the cubicle area, which resembles a darkened 
     maze.  Christy hears Joey approaching; she runs into the 
     cubicle area.

                               JOEY
               Christy?  He only wants to talk to you!

     Page 14.

     ANGLE on Christy, crouched behind a half-wall.  She is 
     clutching the coat.

                               WILLY
               Christy?

     There is a stuffed toy, a "Garfield the Cat," attached to 
     the wall near Christy, with suction cups.  Christy tries to 
     pull the cat's feet off the wall, very quietly.

                               JOEY
               Christy?

     Christy finally just yanks the cat off the wall.  She 
     hurls it as high and as far as she can, to the opposite end 
     of the room.

     ANGLE on the flying stuffed cat.

     Joey sees the blur of the cat; he SHOOTS it, and the cat 
     explodes.

                               JOEY
               Come on, Christy!  There's no place to 
               go!

     Christy steadies herself against a Xerox machine.  She 
     accidentally activates the machine, which lights up and 
     starts HUMMING.

     ANGLE on Willy, as he hears the Xerox machine.  He quickly 
     moves toward the SOUND.

     Willy reaches the Xerox machine; the area is deserted.  He 
     starts moving quickly down the aisle   A chair, the kind on 
     casters, comes rolling out of one of the cubicle doorways; 
     the chair hits Willy and he falls.

     Christy runs out of the cubicle; Willy is on the floor, 
     struggling to get up.  As Christy sprints away, Willy 
     SHOOTS at her.  He misses, but a glass partition SHATTERS.

     Christy runs for an open elevator, but it has been 
     summoned from another floor and the doors are beginning to 
     close. She runs even faster.  A BULLET whistles past her 
     ear and hits the back wall of the elevator.  She reaches 
     for the doors a moment too late, and the elevator is gone.

     Christy scrambles to the door beside the elevator and runs 
     into a stairwell as two more BULLETS bite pieces out of the 
     door.

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Taking the stairs three at a time, Christy is flying, 
     still clutching the mink.  The thugs are gaining on her.  A 
     BULLET hits metal and RICOCHETS off several walls and 
     steps.

     Page 15.

     At the next landing, Christy opens the door and ducks into 
     a corridor.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Exhausted but powered by adrenaline, Christy sprints past 
     doors to the end of the hall, still with the mink.  Joey 
     appears from the stairwell just as Christy ducks into a 
     supply room.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM

     Christy shoves a cleaning cart aside and wades through a 
     pile of dirty linen.  Joey opens the door just as Christy 
     dives head first into the laundry chute.

     INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE

     Christy, lying atop the mink, flies through the chute like 
     a subway train through a tunnel.

     INT. BASEMENT

     The chute spits Christy out like a bullet into a huge bin 
     of dirty linen.  Two workers glance around as they load 
     large washing machines with laundry.  Christy climbs out of 
     the bin and dashes for a door.  Working in a hotel, the 
     workers have seen everything.

     INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE

     Joey flies through the chute.

     INT. BASEMENT

     Joey suddenly flies into the bin.  He climbs out with his 
     gun in sight.

                               JOEY
               Which way?

     The workers point to the door, and Joey rushes across the 
     room.  One of the workers is now wearing the mink coat.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Joey comes out of the hotel and finds an empty street.  He 
     looks in every direction, but the nearby streets have 
     swallowed Christy into safety for the moment.

     EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     The central offices of the Las Vegas Police Department.

     INT. MULCAHY'S OFFICE

     Eddie's office is a glassed-in area set in the middle of 
     the station's main floor.

     Page 16.

     Christy is huddled in a chair, surrounded by Eddie and two 
     other detectives, CLARKSON and TATE.

                               CHRISTY
               Right between the eyes!  Down and out! 
               The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't 
               believe it!

                               EDDIE
               You couldn't believe it?  Vince the 
               Prince?

                               CHRISTY
               I never said he was an altar boy, okay?  
               But he sent his goons after me!  They 
               tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!

                               CLARKSON
               Tough break.  Whoa.

                               EDDIE
               What did you expect?  Vince is as dirty 
               as they come.  We've been finding bodies 
               around here for years.

                               CHRISTY
               I don't know anything about bodies!  I 
               mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was 
               good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. 
               He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to 
               go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let 
               me sing.

                               EDDIE
               He didn't do you a favor.

                               CHRISTY
               Screw you!

                               TATE
               Come on, she'll sing great.  When she 
               sings for us.

                               CHRISTY
               Sing -- like testify?  Are you nuts?  I 
               just want you to protect me!  You're 
               cops!

               Busy cops.  We don't have time to be 
               bodyguards for anyone who comes in here 
               with some cockamamie story.  Mink coats 
               and laundry chutes.

               What is this, some squeeze play?  Can't 
               you just protect me without any strings?

     The three detectives move in closer now and really apply 
     the pressure.

                               EDDIE
               We could put you into our witness 
               protection program.

               A hiding place.

               A new identity.

                               EDDIE
               But you'd have to agree to testify.  The 
               whole nine yards.

                               CHRISTY
               And if I don't?

                               EDDIE
               Then-you run.

               You wait.

               You listen for the footsteps.

                               EDDIE
               Then one day they find you.

               They open a window.

                               CLARKSON
               It's ten flights up.

                               TATE
               Ten flights down.

                               CHRISTY
               Ten flights?

                               EDDIE
               You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the 
               sidewalk.  And into the street.

                               CHRISTY
               All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do 
               it!  I'll testify!

                               EDDIE

     Tate leaves.  Christy looks to Eddie for a bargain now.

                               CHRISTY
               Okay, here's what I want.  I know about 
               this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With 
               room service.

                               EDDIE
               Maybe Hawaii.

               Diamond Head.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah.  And I'll need a new look.  Like a 
               disguise.

                               EDDIE
               Maybe Armani.

                               CLARKSON
               No -- Calvin Klein.

                               CHRISTY
               For sportswear.  And a limo.  And my 
               hair -- up?

                               CLARKSON
               It could work.

                               EDDIE
               Jesus, what do you think this is --
               Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out 
               for you.  You have to hide like you don't 
               even exist.  You have to get so far 
               hidden away that you never see sunlight.

                               CHRISTY
                             (confused)
               Okay -- no limo.

                               EDDIE
               No nothing.

                               CHRISTY
               What're you gonna do, put me in a bag 
               and bury me?

                               EDDIE
               I'm gonna put you in the last place on 
               Earth that Vince would ever look for you.

     Eddie smiles.  Christy doesn't like the sound of this at 
     all a

     INT. STAINED CLASS WINDOW - DAY

     Jesus delivers the Sermon on the Mount in vibrant red, 
     blue and green stained glass.  An ORGAN plays a hymn -- 
     badly.  Notes are missed, skipped over and mutilated.

     PAN DOWN to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel 
     at the ancient St. Katherine's Convent.  The organ isn't 
     getting any better, and we see it is being played by SISTER 
     ALMA, a seventy-year-old nun with arthritis and a hearing 
     aid.  Apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning, because 
     Sister Alma doesn't seem to realize how badly she's 
     playing.

     As the last nun in the procession enters the chapel, she 
     closes the door behind her.  Across the lobby, the front 
     door opens and Eddie enters with a very reluctant Christy.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Eddie)
               I hate you.  I totally hate you.

                               EDDIE
               Safest place in the world.  You think 
               Vince would look for you here?

     As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious 
     artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V. 
     ANGLE on a crucifix, casting an ominous shadow, a stack of 
     hymnals, and a large, framed Sunday School-style portrait 
     of St. Katherine.  Christy shudders.

                               CHRISTY
               Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. 
               Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.

                               EDDIE
               It's a convent.  All you have to do is 
               shut up, behave yourself, and get along.

                               CHRISTY
               With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm 
               gonna go back, work things out with 
               Vince.

     Christy turns to head back to the entrance, but Eddie 
     catches her arm.

                               EDDIE
               Vince has put out a contract on you.  A 
               hundred grand.  You've seen him in 
               action.

     Christy searches his eyes for a lie, but realizes he's 
     telling the truth.

                               CHRISTY
               But... but Vince loves me.  How could 
               he... I mean, five years...

     Page 20.

                               EDDIE
               And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna 
               take.

                               CHRISTY
                             (suddenly scared)
               But Vince has contacts all over the 
               place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll 
               be looking for me!

                               EDDIE
               Everywhere but this little hole-in-the-
               wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here 
               but me.  We're trying to get a quick 
               court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. 
               I'll spring you as soon as I can.

                               CHRISTY
                             (panicking)
               I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! 
               Eddie, what am I gonna do?

                               EDDIE
               Pray.
                             (smiling)

     From inside the chapel, the CHOIR begins to sing a hymn --
     horribly.  The voices don't blend, and individual notes are 
     real migraine material.  Christy looks aghast.  Eddie urges 
     her into a corridor, and she follows.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     The office is bare and austere.  MOTHER SUPERIOR sits at 
     her desk with her hands folded.  Like all the nuns at the 
     convent, she wears the traditional full-length habit and 
     wimple.

     Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, 
     and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as 
     she rules.  Control is her passion; within the walls of the 
     convent, she has created a world she can trust because it's 
     a world she controls.

               But Mother Superior is not in control at 
               this particular moment.  BISHOP GEORGE 
               O'HARA stands before her with a majestic 
               presence and some bad news.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but 
               no.

                               O'HARA
               We can save this young woman's life, and 
               imprison a parasite -- all in one 
               gesture.

     Page 21.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But she's been exposed to the underside 
               of life.  She is the underside of life.

                               O'HARA
               And therefore an ideal prospect for 
               rehabilitation.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely 
               there are... more appropriate shelters.

                               O'HARA
               Your small convent is in danger of 
               closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas 
               Police Department has offered to make a 
               generous financial donation.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But, Bishop...

                               O'HARA
               St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. 
               You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To 
               all in need.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I lied.

                               O'HARA
               I know.
                             (smiling)

     Mother Superior's jaw locks.  She realizes she is stuck 
     with the situation and will have to control it as best she 
     can.  There is a KNOCK at the door, and Eddie and Christy 
     enter.

                               O'HARA
               Welcome, Lieutenant.  Everything is in 
               order.

                               EDDIE
               Aces.  Bishop -- maybe a cup of coffee, 
               down at the corner?

     The thought of being left alone with Mother Superior 
     panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's 
     office.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey, you're not leaving me alone...

                               O'HARA
                             (reassuringly)
               You're never alone in this house, my 
               child.

     Eddie touches her gently on the arm.

     Page 22.

                               EDDIE
               One month, two tops.  Behave yourself.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Bishop...
                             (a last-ditch attempt)

                               O'HARA
                             (opening the door to 
                             leave)
               Lieutenant?

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. THE CONVENT - A FEW SECONDS LATER

     Eddie and Bishop 0'Hara are leaving, by the convent's 
     front door.  As they exit, they hear the CHOIR, singing 
     horribly. They both wince at the sound, and then chuckle.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     Christy is pacing, outraged at her new situation.

                               CHRISTY
               A convent?  They put me in a convent? 
               What's the problem?  Wasn't there any 
               more room in Hell?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (very calm)
               What is your full name?  Your Christian 
               name?

                               CHRISTY
               Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you 
               understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm 
               the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm 
               being punished!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Your name?

                               CHRISTY
               Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Enough joking.

                               CHRISTY
               That's my real name!  Currently I'm a  
               singer.  Sort of.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Very well.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell 
               me this isn't happening.  It's a 
               nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!

     Page 23.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               St. Anne's?

                               CHRISTY
               Parochial school.  Akron.  St. 
               Android's.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You were unhappy?

                               CHRISTY
               I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The reason?

                               CHRISTY
               Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! 
               Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy 
               petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing 
               a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon 
               bra.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I see.

                               CHRISTY
               You see?  You see?  I have to get out of 
               here   I have to make a phone call.  
               Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent!  
               You're a nun!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (very stern)
               Sit down.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

     Mother Superior rises.  She is an extremely imposing 
     woman. 

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sit.

     Christy sits in a wooden chair across from Mother 
     Superior.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Miss Van Cartier. 

                               CHRISTY
               What?
                             (belligerent)

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Your cigarette -- out.

     Christy inspects her cigarette.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (ruefully)
               It has come to pass.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I joined this convent some thirty years 
               ago.  At that time, the world knew some 
               measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order 
               was a beacon of hospitality, to families, 
               to children, to a neighborhood filled 
               with promise.  And, as the years have 
               passed, I have watched that promise 
               destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.
                             (staring at Christy's 
                             outfit) Spandex.  And. 
                             so I have made this 
                             convent an oasis, a 
                             retreat from horror. 
                             And now that horror has 
                             invaded these sacred 
                             walls.

                               CHRISTY
               Are you talking about me?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And all those like you.

                               CHRISTY
               You mean black people?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The 
               heedless.  And their Las Vegas 
               concubines.

                               CHRISTY
                             (very suspicious) 
                             What's a concubine?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Check your driver's license.

     Christy stands, facing off with Mother Superior.

                               CHRISTY
               Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, 
               I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here 
               or I'm target practice.  So here's the 
               deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug 
               me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch 
               some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just 
               get me a key and show me to my room, and 
               do not disturb.  Capisce?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (suspiciously 
                             gracious)
               Of course.  But it's almost lunch.

     Page 25.

                               CHRISTY
               Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Before we do, you might like to freshen 
               up.  And you'll certainly want to change

                               CHRISTY
                             (sniffing her clothes, 
                             the same outfit she's 
                             had on since the night 
                             at Vince's office)
               Deal.

     INT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM

     A small room, with a sewing machine, some bolts of fabric, 
     and several wooden cabinets.  There is a wooden screen in a 
     corner, marking a changing area.  Christy is behind the 
     screen; we hear her, but do not see her,  Mother Superior 
     stands beside the screen, catching the various items of 
     clothing which Christy tosses to her.

                               CHRISTY (O.S.)
               How about a robe?  One of those big 
               terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on 
               the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Would you like that?

     Mother Superior takes Christy's skirt and blouse, and 
     tosses them down a chute marked "INCINERATOR."

                               CHRISTY (O.S.)
               You should hand-wash that blouse, and 
               send somebody out for some things.  I 
               look good in reds, purples, hot pink --
               and shoes.  Five-inch heels.  Fuck-me 
               pumps.  Oh, man -- sorry.   'Scuse my 
               mouth.

     Mother Superior carries Christy's lacy bra at the end of a 
     ruler; it goes down the incinerator.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. 
               You will find appropriate attire.

                               CHRISTY (O.S.)
               Can do.

     INT. CHAPEL

     A group of nuns are praying, their heads bowed.  They hear 
     a muffled SCREAM, from elsewhere in the convent. They look 
     up, puzzled.

     Page 26.

     INT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM

     Christy is standing before a full-length mirror, staring 
     at herself, in complete shock.  She now wears a habit and 
     wimple.  Mother Superior is doing final adjustments on the 
     wimple.

                               CHRISTY
                             (almost unable to 
                             speak)
               No!  No!  I can't do this!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, 
               and you endanger us all.  While you are 
               here, you will conduct yourself as a nun.  
               Only I shall know who, and what, you 
               truly are.  You will not disrupt the 
               convent.  You will not influence the 
               Sisters with your colorful street talk. 
               You will draw no attention to yourself in 
               any way.

                               CHRISTY
                             (furious, in 
                             disbelief)
               But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a 
               nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               As of now, and until you leave, you are 
               Sister Mary Clarence.

                               CHRISTY
                             (outraged)
               Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb 
               guy?

     INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - A MINUTE LATER

     Mother Superior is striding down the hall.  Christy is 
     beside her, trying to get the hang of her new outfit.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The Mary is in deference to the Holy 
               Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint 
               Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows 
               that every nun must accept.  The vow of 
               poverty...

                               CHRISTY
                             (pulling out her 
                             pockets)
               No problem.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The vow of obedience.

                               CHRISTY
               Like to who?

     Page 27.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And the vow of chastity.

                               CHRISTY
               I'm outta here.

     Christy starts to leave; Mother Superior grabs her by the 
     wimple

     INT. CONVENT DINING HALL

     A large, whitewashed gothic room, with oak beams and a 
     crude iron chandelier.  There is a long, central wooden 
     table, with rough wooden benches.

     The convent's population is standing around the table in 
     silence.  There are about thirty nuns in all.

     Mother Superior moves to the head of the table, with 
     Christy following her.  She motions for Christy to stand at 
     her right.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Good afternoon, Sisters.  I apologize 
               for my tardiness.  I would like you to 
               welcome a new member of our order, Sister 
               Mary Clarence.

     ANGLE on SISTER MARY ROBERT, the nun standing beside 
     Christy.  Sister Mary Robert is naive and mouse- like, but 
     very sweet.  She has only been at the convent a few years; 
     she wears the simpler habit of a novice.  She sneaks a look 
     at Christy.  Her eyes widen, and then she resumes staring 
     at her hands.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence comes to us from a 
               somewhat more progressive convent.  She 
               is eager for a more disciplined life, and 
               will make every effort to conform to our 
               ways.

     Everyone sits, including Christy.  SISTER MARY PATRICK, a 
     nun seated at the middle of the table, waves her hand. Mary 
     Patrick is extremely cheerful, a truly upbeat person.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes, Mary Patrick?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Reverend Mother, on behalf of the 
               sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary 
               Clarence to St. Katherine's.

     ANGLE on Christy, looking thoroughly disgusted. 

     Page 28.

                               MARY PATRICK
               As part of our welcome, I've had a 
               little thought, just for fun.  Could we 
               have our new friend offer today's 
               blessing?

     ANGLE on the nuns, watching Christy.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (reluctantly)
               Very well.  Mary Clarence, rise please.

     Christy stands up slowly, aghast.

                               CHRISTY
               A blessing?  Like, for lunch?

     ANGLE on Mary Patrick, beaming.  She and the other nuns 
     bow their heads.

                               CHRISTY
                             (trying to recall a 
                             blessing)
               For what we are about to receive...

     So far, so good.  Mother Superior has one eye open.

                               CHRISTY
               may the Lord... prepare us and... watch 
               us and... walk through the valley and be 
               our shepherd and... to the republic for 
               which it stands... God bless us every 
               one, hallowed be thy name.  Hallelujah.  
               Ave Maria. Boyardee.  Amen.

     ANGLE on the nuns, staring at Christy. Mother Superior 
     rises, very quickly.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sisters, for the rest of the day we 
               shall declare a Vow of Silence.

                               CHRISTY
               A what?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Surely you are familiar with this 
               practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our 
               lips are silent, can our prayers truly be 
               heard.

                               CHRISTY
               Silence?  No talking?  All day?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Until sundown.

     Page 29.

                               CHRISTY
                             (mouthing the words. 
                             without speaking aloud)
               Oh my God.

     Christy reaches for a piece of bread.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And Mary Clarence?

     Christy looks up.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               As a new member of our order, I think 
               you might also enjoy a ritual fast.

                               CHRISTY
                             (mouthing the words)
               A what?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of 
               those who must endure without enough to 
               eat.

                               CHRISTY
                             (mouthing)
               No food?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (taking away Christy's 
                             plate)
               No food.  Not until sundown.

     ANGLE on Christy, clutching her fork, hungrily watching 
     the other nuns eat.

     EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Vince leaves the police station with his henchmen, Joey 
     and Willy, and LARRY NARREN, an attorney.  Vince is 
     steaming as they walk through the parking lot.

                               VINCE
               They grilled me for six hours in there. 
               And my hotshot lawyer -- where the hell 
               were you?

                               LARRY
               It takes time, Vince.  Slow and steady. 
               We've been through this before.

     Vince reaches his car.  As Joey opens the door for him, 
     another car drives by, and stops.  Eddie is driving; he 
     leans out the window.

                               EDDIE
               So long, Vince.  See you soon.

     Page 30.

     Vince lurches toward Eddie; Larry restrains him.  Eddie 
     drives off, chuckling.

                               VINCE
               He's so damn cocky.  This is different.

                               JOEY
               It's a bluff, Vince.

                               VINCE
               You know so much.  They've got Christy, 
               and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, 
               from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to 
               every contact we got.

     Larry covers his ears with both hands.

                               LARRY
               I can't hear this.  I'm an attorney, 
               Vince, and you're just an honest casino 
               owner.  Object of a witch hunt. Innocent 
               victim.

                               VINCE
               Keep the message vague, but let 'em 
               know.  The price has gone up.  Christy 
               Van Cartier -- a quarter of a million.  
               Dead or nearby.

     Vince looks grim and vindictive, as he gets into the car.

     EXT. CONVENT VEGETABLE GARDEN - DAY

     The vegetable patch is located behind the convent, on a 
     patch of land surrounded by high walls.  Various sections 
     have been partitioned with string and then furrowed.

     Several nuns are working in the patch, weeding and raking. 
     They wear large, ungainly straw hats over their wimples.

     Christy has been given a hoe and a straw hat.  She is 
     hacking at the dirt, with great disinterest.  She picks up 
     a carrot from the vegetable patch; she looks around to see 
     if anyone is watching.  She starts to gnaw on the carrot.  
     She becomes aware that someone is watching her.  She looks 
     up.

     Sister Mary Robert is watching Christy eat the carrot, 
     breaking her fast.  Christy drops the carrot on the ground, 
     as if it burned her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing in the 
     next furrow over.

     Christy stares at Mary Robert, narrowing her eyes.  
     Christy looks around; all the other nuns are busy at their 
     tasks.  Christy decides that she will try and make Sister 
     Mary  Robert talk.  She picks up the carrot and tosses it 
     at Mary Robert.  Mary Robert jumps.  She waggles a finger 
     at Christy, scolding her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing.

     Page 31.

     Christy is now determined.  She takes her hoe, and tiptoes 
     nearer to Mary Robert.  Very gently, she uses the handle of 
     the floe to lift Mary Robert's skirt, and gooses her.

     Mary Robert vips, very loudly.  All the other nuns turn 
     and stare at Mary Robert, scolding her.  Christy waggles 
     her finger at Mary Robert, scolding her.

     Christy, giggling to herself, resumes hoeing.  She sees 
     Mother Superior, standing at the end of the furrow.  Mother 
     Superior looks extremely grim; she has not missed anything.

     EXT. SUNSET - THAT NIGHT

     LONG SHOT of the sun going down, ending the nuns' Vow of 
     Silence.

     We hear Christy SCREAM, O.S.

     INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT

     This hallway is marked by a series of heavy wooden doors 
     with tiny, grilled windows.  These are the cells where the 
     nuns sleep.  Nuns are entering their cells and closing 
     their doors for the night.

     Mother Superior glides down the hall, followed by a dusty, 
     bedraggled Christy.  Christy is devouring a slice of brown 
     bread.

                               CHRISTY
               Is this all the food I get?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes.  Until breakfast.

                               CHRISTY
               That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any 
               snacks?  Machines?

     They stop by a door.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.

                               CHRISTY
               My what?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Your cell.  Your room.

     INT. CHRISTY'S CELL

     The door swings open, and Mother Superior and Christy 
     enter.  The room is tiny, with bare plaster walls.  There 
     is a narrow wooden bed, with a thin muslin-covered 
     mattress.  There is a small nightstand and a wooden stool.

     Page 32.

                               CHRISTY
                             (looking around)
               You were right the first time.  Is this 
               like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the 
               furniture?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Our lives are simple.  We have little 
               need for material possessions.

                               CHRISTY
               Right, sure thing.  But what about, 
               like, appliances?  Like a little color 
               portable?  Boom box?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Useless distractions.

                               CHRISTY
                             (sinking to the bed)
               It's like the Stone Age.  The room time 
               forgot.  What about a phone?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And whom would you call?

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, I don't know... Satan?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (not amused) 
               Your cell is more than adequate.

                               CHRISTY
               Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping-
               Pong?  Row over to the monastery?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.

                               CHRISTY
               Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? 
               At nine?  My day's just starting.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use 
               this time, to think about my life.  And 
               its direction.  Or lack thereof.

                               CHRISTY
                             (indignant)
               What's wrong with my life?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               From all I've heard, just about 
               everything.  Your singing career seems 
               all but nonexistent, and your married 
               lover wants you dead.

     Page 33

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
               If you're fooling anyone, it's only 
               yourself.  God has brought you here. Take 
               the hint.

     Mother Superior leaves.

     After the door shuts, Christy stands and looks out the one 
     small window in her cell.  She leans her head against the 
     wall.  She is trying not to think about what Mother 
     Superior has said.  Still, the mess her life has become 
     overwhelms her.  She fights back tears.

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     The sun is just barely rising, as the convent BELL tolls.

     INT. CHRISTY'S CELL

     Christy is fast asleep.  There is a RAPPING at the door.

                               MARY ROBERT (0.S.)
               Sister Mary Clarence!

     EXT. CONVENT HALLWAY

     All the nuns are proceeding, in their simple robes and 
     nightshirts, down the hallway.

     Christy's door opens; she is still in her nightshirt, and 
     her hair is a mess.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

     Mary Robert, in her nightshirt, stands outside.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Come on, we're late.

                               CHRISTY
               What?  What time is it?

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's after five.  We have to bathe.

                               CHRISTY
                             (groaning)
               Five a.m.?

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

     Christy is standing on line in the hall, along with 
     several other nuns; they are waiting to take showers.  They 
     carry soap and towels.

     Page 34.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (sincerely)
               Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good 
               morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?

                               CHRISTY
               Right.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Is this like your old convent?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Which convent was that, Sister?

                               CHRISTY
               Which convent?  It was, um, the Little 
               Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. 
               Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. 
               Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside. 

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Enough jabber.

     MARY LAZARUS is a much older nun; she is very no-nonsense, 
     a hard-liner.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It 
               sounds awful.  It sounds just like this 
               place.

                               CHRISTY
               Like this place?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out 
               in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like 
               here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare 
               feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on 
               earth, but I loved it.  This place is a 
               Hilton.

     INT. BATHING ROOM

     A stone room that is very medieval-looking.  One wall is 
     divided into stalls by wooden partitions.  In each stall is 
     a nun, standing beneath a crude shower head that releases a 
     thin stream of lukewarm water.  We see only the nuns' heads 
     and shoulders.

     Still sleepy, Christy leans against the wall of her stall, 
     her eyes closed.  Lost in thought, she begins singing 
     softly to herself.

     Page 35.

                               CHRISTY
               MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
               AND YOU'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE

                               A FEW OTHER NUNS
                             (very softly)
               HEY-LA, HEY-LA

     Christy looks up from her reverie; she looks around.  The 
     other nuns are bathing, their eyes down.  There is no sign 
     of singing.  Christy decides to try a test.

                               CHRISTY
               MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
               HE'S GONNA SAVE MY REPUTATION

                               A FEW OF THE NUNS
                             (still very softly)
               HEY-LA, HEY-LA

                               CHRISTY
               IF I WERE YOU,
               I'D TAKE A PERMANENT VACATION

                               A FEW OF THE NUNS
               HEY-LA, HEY-LA
               MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK

     The nuns giggle.

                               CHRISTY
               Where did that come from?

                               MARY PATRICK
               I haven't heard that song in ages.  The 
               Ronettes?

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (very grouchy)
               Shirelles.

                               CHRISTY
               You know that song?

                               MARY PATRICK
               1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when 
               many of us took final vows.  It's the 
               last secular music we recall.

                               CHRISTY
               No.
               HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING
               NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING

                               ALL THE NUNS
               HEY-LA, HEY LA

     Page 36.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (cutting off the song)
               That's enough.  We've got to get to 
               chapel.

     Mary Lazarus leaves the bathing room, and the other nuns 
     resume scrubbing themselves.  Christy looks around.

                               CHRISTY
               Anybody got conditioner?

     INT. CHAPEL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

     Bishop O'Hara is leading the Sunday mass.  He stands in 
     the pulpit.  The choir nuns stand in a fenced-in area to 
     his left.  The remaining nuns, including Christy and Mother 
     Superior, sit in the first few pews.

                               O'HARA
               We are a small congregation this 
               morning.  Too many mornings.  Something 
               has gone terribly wrong.   Where is 
               faith?  Where is celebration?  Where is 
               everyone?  Still, rather than regret the 
               absence of our neighbors, let us rejoice 
               in the fellowship of those present.  Our 
               choirmistress, Sister Mary Lazarus, has 
               informed me that our choir, while always 
               superior, has been toiling especially 
               hard on this week's selection.  Sister?

     Mary Lazarus raises her hand, and the choir begins 
     singing. They sing a traditional hymn, "Let Thy Thoughts Be 
     Guided." As always, their singing is dreadful; they have no 
     tempo or pitch, and the hymn becomes an off-key drone.

     As the hymn continues, the CAMERA PANS OVER the chapel. 
     Aside from the nuns, it is almost empty; only a few elderly 
     people are in attendance.

     ANGLE ON CHRISTY

     sitting with the other nuns.  She is clearly about to fall 
     asleep.  Then the choir hits a particularly horrendous 
     note, and Christy jerks awake.  She immediately tries to 
     assume a pious expression, tilting her head and folding her 
     hands in prayer; she looks like a somewhat demented Sunday 
     School calendar.

     EXT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT

     Detective Clarkson gets out of his car and hurries into 
     the police station.

     INT. POLICE STATION

     Clarkson crosses the busy room to Eddie's glass-walled 
     office.  Along the way, he signals Detective Tate to follow 
     him.

     Page 37.

     INT. MULCAHY'S OFFICE

     Eddie looks up from his desk as the two detectives enter.

                               CLARKSON
               There was a raid on a pawnshop in L.A. 
               this morning.  The place was fencing 
               stolen property.  They found this.

     Clarkson gives Eddie a fax sheet, showing a publicity 
     photograph of Christy.

                               EDDIE
               Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a 
               wonderful world.
                             (reading the fax 
                             sheet) 
               Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two 
               hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 
               Please find our adored angel, we miss her 
               so.  Dead or alive.

                               TATE
               Vince is getting desperate.  Where is 
               she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?

                               EDDIE
               Where's who?

                               TATE
               You won't even tell us?

                               EDDIE
               I wouldn't even tell the Pope.

     INT. CONVENT SCHOOLROOM - AN HOUR LATER

     A plain whitewashed classroom, with battered student-style 
     desks.  A group of about eight local TEENAGE GIRLS has 
     gathered.  The girls wear extremes of hair, makeup and 
     clothing; they are bored and scruffy, clearly the local bad 
     Girls.  Sister Mary Patrick is leading the class, in her 
     usual perky manner.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Good afternoon, young ladies.  And 
               welcome to our Christian Youth Group.

     The Girls make grunting noises.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Hi.  I hope we'll have some fun, and 
               maybe learn a little something, too. Now, 
               today's topic is something very up-to-
               date -- "Teenage Promiscuity."  My. Now, 
               can anyone tell me -- just what is 
               promiscuity?

     ANGLE on the Girls, exchanging glances and rolling their 
     eyes.

     Page 38

                               MARY PATRICK
               Anyone?  Yes?

     Mary Patrick points to a Girl in bicycle pants. a bustier 
     and a leather baseball cap.  Her name is Lawanda.

                               LAWANDA
               Uh, it's like, you know, doin' it.  A 
               whole lot.  Till your head falls off.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (blushing)
               Well, yes.  That is one way to put it.

     Mother Superior enters the classroom accompanied by 
     Christy

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sister Mary Patrick?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Yes?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I need to see you, at once.  Girls, 
               please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a 
               few moments.  Mary Clarence?

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. 
               She'll be minding you until Sister Mary 
               Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please 
               assign a biblical passage.  Do not 
               attempt discussion.  Am I understood?

                               CHRISTY
               I got it.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (to Mary Patrick)
               Come, Sister.

     Mother Superior and Mary Patrick leave the classroom. 
     Christy now stands at the front of the room.  She is 
     visibly uncomfortable.

                               CHRISTY
               So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary 
               Clarence.  And you're... young 
               Christians.  I guess I should assign you 
               this passage.  What's good?  What were 
               you talking about?

                               LAWANDA
               We were talking about the wild thing. 
               Teen promiscuity.

                               CHRISTY
                             (after a beat)
               Really.

                               CHARLENE
               Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing 
               it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.

                               CHRISTY
                             (trying to behave)
               Well... yes.  Yes it is.

                               LAWANDA
                             (goading Christy)
               How come?  Sister?

                               CHRISTY
                             (still trying to 
                             behave)
               Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou 
               shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.

     The Girls all laugh and make jeering noises.

                               CHRISTY
               Excuse me -- just what are you all doing 
               here?  At Sunday School?

                               LAWANDA
               'Cause we love it so damn much.  And 
               cause we gotta come here.  Probation.

                               CHRISTY
               Probation?

                               CHARLENE
               Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. 
               Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch 
               with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So 
               we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll 
               learn valuable lessons.  And I learned 
               mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will 
               never rip out nobody's nose-ring by 
               accident ever again.  Can I go now?

                               CHRISTY
                             (getting fed up)
               Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can 
               tell.

                               LAWANDA
               Well, what would you know about it, 
               anyway?  What do any of you nunheads know 
               about anything?  About doin' the nasty, 
               or gettin' high?

                               CONCHITA
               Leave her alone, Lawanda, she's just 
               some ol' nun!  Don't pick on no nun, it's 
               bad luck!

     Page 40.

                               CHRISTY
                             (fed up)
               Shut up!

     All the Girls look up, stunned by Christy's language.

                               CHRISTY
               Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want 
               to ask me something?  You want to listen, 
               for once in your little lives? You want 
               to pay some attention?

                               CHARLENE
               What about crack?  You a user?

                               CHRISTY
               I said I was a nun, not an asshole.

     All the girls jeer at Charlene.

                               KESHIA
               Got you, Charlene!

                               CONCHITA
               Dunked by the nun!

                               LAWANDA
                             (more sincerely)
               Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if 
               some dude is after you, and he's always 
               saying stuff, commin' on sweet and 
               mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll 
               love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, 
               you'd stay.

                               CHRISTY
               And you listen to that?

                               LAWANDA
               No, but... I don't know... sometimes.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I 
               do.

                               LAWANDA
                             (puzzled)
               What you do?

                               CHRISTY
               Just tell him, I do love you, but I 
               can't -- I'm a nun.

     The girls all laugh; they are really beginning to like 
     Christy.

     Page 41.

                               CHARLENE
               But, like what if you are doin' it? What 
               about protection?  Who's responsible?

                               CONCHITA
               What about them things, you know, for 
               the guy?  Aren't they like, a mess to put 
               on?  Don't they kinda mess up the mood?

                               CHRISTY
               Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's 
               important, nowadays.  You just practice 
               at home, with a balloon and a banana.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (0.S.)
               Mary Clarence!

     Mother Superior has returned, with Mary Patrick.  Everyone 
     has been so wrapped up in the discussion, that no one has 
     noticed their entrance.

                               CHRISTY
                             (thinking on her feet)
               Because a banana is part of a balanced 
               breakfast.  And don't forget fiber.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

     Mother Superior is seated behind her desk; she is very 
     angry.  Christy sits across from her.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary 
               Clarence, what were you thinking?

                               CHRISTY
               Those girls were asking questions.  
               They've got it rough.  I wish somebody 
               had talked to me about that stuff when 
               was their age.  I wish somebody would 
               talk to me about it now.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               This is a convent, not a clinic.  We 
               offer moral guidance, not hardware.

                               CHRISTY
               Have you been out in those streets?  Do 
               you know what those kids are up against?  
               You should help them!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               We are nuns.  We seek solutions through 
               prayer.

     Page 42.

                               CHRISTY
               Sometimes it's not enough!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone 
               cannot help a situation.  Such as your 
               own, for example.  How do you feel about 
               physical labor?

                               CHRISTY
               It never solves anything.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, 
               in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a 
               wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy 
               task, and know ye the path of 
               contentment."

                               CHRISTY
               In English?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary 
               Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."

     Mother Superior smiles in a rather evil manner.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE - DAY

     Vince is on the telephone in his office at the Moonlight 
     Hotel and Casino.  He clearly has a new mistress or two.

                               VINCE
                             (very seductive)
               Baby, you know I do... of course... I 
               feel it too... I'm blushing... can you 
               hold?

     A second telephone RINGS, and Willy answers it.  Vince 
     meanwhile has pushed a button on his phone and is involved 
     in a second romantic call.

                               VINCE
               Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... 
               how lonely?

                               WILLY
               It's that call you were expecting, 
               Vince.

                               VINCE
               Can you hold?  Can you try?

     Willy passes the phone to Vince. t

     Page 43

                               VINCE
               Have you found out where Christy is yet?  
               Hey, bozo, you re on my payroll! You want 
               to try making it on a cop's salary?  Find 
               her, and find her now!

     Vince passes the phone back to Willy.

                               VINCE
               Raise the ante to three hundred grand.

     Willy heads for the fax machine.  Vince regains his 
     composure, and picks up his own phone; he pushes a button.

                               VINCE
               Sorry, baby... you are?  Totally?  Not a 
               stitch?... Yeah, I'm naked too... 
               inside...

     INT. CONVENT CRAFTS ROOM

     This is a large, open room where the nuns create various 
     gift items which the convent sells to support itself.  
     Several nuns sit at a table, diligently hand-painting 
     Christmas cards and making Christmas tree ornaments.

     On the other side of the room is a large, free-standing 
     loom, which resembles a grand piano.  The loom is wooden; a 
     tapestry is half-completed.  Mary Patrick is seated at the 
     loom, which is a complicated mechanism.  Christy stands 
     beside her.

                               MARY PATRICK
               The minute I saw you. I said to myself, 
               she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a 
               loom?

                               CHRISTY
               Not in years.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Well, it all comes back, in just a 
               jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of 
               the convent.

                               CHRISTY
               Why?

                               MARY PATRICK
               To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, 
               but we're in terrible trouble here at St. 
               Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the 
               furnace is going, and there's no money.

                               CHRISTY
               But don't you get money?  From the 
               Vatican?

     Page 44.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely 
               self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like 
               yours.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, right.  At my old place, we used 
               to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice 
               loom.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, 
               and then you can hop right in.
                             (as she deftly works 
                             the loom)
               You just draw your beater in, keep it 
               pressed against the pick, and open the 
               shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and 
               open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, 
               shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the 
               warp.  Is that clear?

                               CHRISTY
                             (pretending to be 
                             fascinated)
               Just about.  Show me again.

                               MARY PATRICK
               You betcha.

     CRAFTS ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

     ANGLE on the wall hanging, which has progressed 
     considerably.

     ANGLE on Christy, leaning against the wall, thumbing 
     through a magazine.

     ANGLE on Mary Patrick, hard at work at the loom.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your 
               heddles.

                               CHRISTY
               I love my heddles.  Show me again.

     Mother Superior appears.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving 
               progressing?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend 
               Mother -

     Page 45.

                               CHRISTY
               Really catching on.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the 
               office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.

     Mother Superior gestures to the loom.  Christy sits at the 
     loom, and waves as Mother Superior and Mary Patrick exit.

     Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her 
     face.  She has not been paying attention to Mary Patrick's 
     instructions.  She cracks her knuckles, as if she were 
     about to play the piano.  She grabs two parts of the loom, 
     at random.  She moves these parts.

     ANGLE on the loom.  As a result of Christy's movements, 
     the loom collapses, piece by piece.  The tapestry unravels, 
     the many skeins of wool snap, and the mechanical apparatus 
     disintegrates, until finally the entire loom shudders and 
     falls to the floor, as Christy watches, aghast.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Mother Superior is striding down the hall; she is livid. 
     Christy trails behind her, trying to keep up.

                               CHRISTY
               I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Months of work, and the loom, absolutely 
               ruined!

                               CHRISTY
               Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I 
               wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, 
               or knit little sweaters! I don't do that!  
               I'm a star!

     Mother Superior stops dead in her tracks; she turns and 
     stares at Christy.  Then she smiles, in a rather 
     frightening manner.

     MONTAGE - CHRISTY

     A)on her hands and knees. scrubbing the stone floor of a 
     convent hallway.

     B)crawling along between the pews in the chapel, oiling 
     every inch of wood with a bottle of polish and a rag.

     C)crawling along the convent roof, cleaning out gutters 
     with a trowel.  She discovers a dead rat in one of the 
     gutters.

     Page 46

     D)sewing; she is repairing a hole in a habit.  The CAMERA 
     PULLS BACK.  Christy is sitting in a small stone room, 
     surrounded by piles of torn habits, linen and other 
     mending.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     Christy is on the phone in the darkened office.  She keeps 
     checking the door, to make sure no one is listening.

                               CHRISTY
                             (into phone)
               Let me talk to Detective Eddie Mulcahy.  
               It's an emergency.  Real bad.

                               EDDIE'S VOICE
               Mulcahy.

     Christy cups her hand around the phone and speaks quietly 
     and frantically.  INTERCUT between Christy and Eddie.

                               CHRISTY
               Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.

                               EDDIE
               Not again.  You can't keep calling. 
               Somebody's going to catch on to where you 
               are.

                               CHRISTY
               But I'm going insane!  All these people 
               do is pray and work, work and pray!  I 
               don't get it -- when's the weekend? They 
               have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call 
               food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns!  
               I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray 
               five times a days  Do you know what I 
               pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea?  
               Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall 
               off yet?  Get me outta her!

                               EDDIE
               Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell 
               you this, but we've had some problems 
               with our protection program lately.

                               CHRISTY
               Like what?

                               EDDIE
               Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide 
               them, but there's a leak in the 
               department, and they end up dead.

                               CHRISTY
               You son-of-a-bitch!

     Page 47

                               EDDIE
               I just need a few more weeks,

                               CHRISTY
               But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior 
               is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She 
               keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!

     In the distance, Christy hears the CHOIR practicing; they 
     sound even worse than usual.

                               CHRISTY
                             (holding the phone 
                             out)
               Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, 
               in here, that's what they call music!

                               EDDIE
               Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll 
               be in touch.

     As the line goes dead, Mother Superior enters.  Christy 
     takes her dust rag and pretends to polish the receiver. She 
     sings as she works.

                               CHRISTY
               THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF 
               MUSIC...

     Still singing, Christy breezes out of the room.  Mother 
     Superior looks mystified.

     INT. CHRISTY'S CELL - MIDNIGHT

     Christy is lying flat out on her bed, in her habit, 
     utterly exhausted by the week's hard labor.  There is a 
     meek SCRATCHING at her door.

                               CHRISTY
                             (without moving)
               Yeah?

     Sister Mary Robert enters, very shyly.  She barely looks 
     up.

                               CHRISTY
               What?  What does she want now?  I did 
               the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted 
               the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why 
               can't people share?

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (not speaking above a 
                             whisper)
               I... I...

     Page 48.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MARY ROBERT
               I... I brought you something.

                               CHRISTY
               A cigarette?

                               MARY ROBERT
               An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, 
               you need your strength.  You've been 
               working so hard.

     Mary Robert holds out a rather rugged crust of brown 
     bread.  Christy takes it..

                               CHRISTY
               Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister 
               Bruce?  Sister Doug?

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (until almost 
                             whispering)
               Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.

                               CHRISTY
               Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.

     Mary Robert nods, and resumes looking at her hands.  She 
     doesn't 1eave, but she's still tongue-tied. Christy is at a 
     loss.

                               CHRISTY
               So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. 
               K's?

                               MARY ROBERT
               Three years.  Sister.

                               CHRISTY
               Three years.  A rookie.

                               MARY ROBERT
               A novice.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? 
               When do you hit the big time?  You know, 
               when do you take the final vows?

     Mary Robert bursts into tears.

                               CHRISTY
               Whoa!  Bob!  What's going on here? 
               What'd I say?

     Page 49.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (still sobbing)
               You have to help me

                               CHRISTY
               Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are 
               they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they 
               drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, 
               kidnap your parents?  We can call the 
               Enquirer.

                               MARY ROBERT
               No, you don't understand -- I don't want 
               to get out!  I want to get in?

                               CHRISTY
               Excuse me?

                               MARY ROBERT
               Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I 
               want to take my final vows, I would do it 
               tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let 
               me!

                               CHRISTY
               She won't?  Why not?

                               MARY ROBERT
               She says I should wait.  She says that 
               no one should become a nun as an escape 
               from life.  She says that I'm not 
               experienced enough to make the decision 
               yet.  In a mature manner.

                               CHRISTY
               She said that?  Reverend Mother?

     Mary Robert nods, solemnly.  Suddenly, from the streets 
     outside the convent, we hear a BLAST OF hot dance MUSIC, 
     and the SOUND of laughter and carefree conversation.

                               CHRISTY
               Well, then there's only one thing to do.

                               MARY ROBERT
               What?

                               CHRISTY
               Reverend Mother says you need 
               experience, right, in life.  In order to 
               make a responsible decision.  This is 
               going to be very painful for me.  You 
               know how much I love this little room. 
               This whole convent.  Wait.

     Christy stands, and goes to the crucifix hanging on the 
     wall.  She speaks to the crucifix, and listens, as if Jesus 
     is advising her.

     Page 50.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Jesus)
               Must I do this thing, 0 Lord?  Please 
               help me.,. yes, I know... I must put my 
               selfish cares aside... I must think of 
               others... yes, she's here...
                             (she gestures to Mary 
                             Robert)
               He says hi... yes, I understand... let 
               thy will be done.  Amen.  You too.

     Christy turns to Mary Robert, having received a holy 
     message.

                               CHRISTY
               We must do this sacred thing, Mary 
               Robert.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (desperate)
               Of course!  We must do it!  It's the 
               will of God!  What is it?

                               CHRISTY
                             (shutting her eyes, 
                             for the full spiritual 
                             effect)
               We must... get you some experience.  We 
               must... leave this place.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Are you sure?

     Another BLAST OF MUSIC from the street.  Christy turns to 
     the crucifix.  She gets confirmation.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Jesus)
               We hear you.

     EXT. STREET

     The outer wall of the convent.  A door swings open, and 
     Christy sticks her head out.  She looks both ways, and 
     steps outside.  She beckons to Mary Robert, who appears 
     from behind her.  Mary Robert looks very wary.  Christy 
     pulls her along.

     EXT. A STREET NEARBY

     Christy and Mary Robert walk along a street a few blocks 
     from the convent.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (looking around 
                             cautiously)
               Are you sure this is what Reverend 
               Mother had in mind?

     Page 51.

                               CHRISTY
               I know it is.  It's life.  Experience.  
               Take a deep breath.

     Christy breathes deep, and then lets out a whoop.  She 
     spins, letting her habit billow around her.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (shocked)
               Mary Clarence!

                               CHRISTY
               Now you.

     Mary Robert's eyes widen.  She points to herself -- "Me?" 
     Christy nods.  Mary Robert lets out a tiny little whoop, 
     and does a little, timid hop.

                               CHRISTY
               It's a start.

     EXT. SOCIAL CLUB

     A neighborhood hang-out, the windows bright with neon beer 
     signs.  The exterior is colorfully painted; the club all 
     but explodes with good times.  A group of teenagers lounge 
     on the steps, sipping beers and smoking.  Among the 
     teenagers are the girls from Christy's Christian Youth 
     group.  Christy and Mary Robert approach, and the group 
     falls silent.

                               CHRISTY
               How are you doing.

                               LAWANDA
                             (puzzled)
               Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?

                               CHRISTY
               You know it.

                               MARY ROBERT
               We need experience.

                               CHRISTY
                             (remembering she's a 
                             nun)
               It's part of St. Katherine's new 
               community outreach program.  How old are 
               you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you 
               ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em 
               over.

     Lawanda reluctantly hands over her cigarettes.  Christy 
     turns to a TEENAGE BOY who's drinking beer.

     Page 52.

                               CHRISTY
               And you, with the devil's brew passing 
               through your lips.
                             (holding out her hand)
               A mind is a terrible thing to waste.

     The boy hands over the beer.  Christy and Mary Robert 
     enter the club.

     INT. SOCIAL CLUB

     Christy enters the club and grins.  She takes a drag on 
     the cigarette.  Mary Robert grabs the beer from Christy's 
     hand, and takes a swig.

                               CHRISTY
                             (shocked)
               Bobs

                               MARY ROBERT
               Experience!  Right?

                               CHRISTY
               Right.

     The club is alive with activity; the bar is crowded, 
     couples are making out at small tables, and the dance floor 
     is packed.  The atmosphere is a combination of hazy 
     darkness and colored lights; the club should have the 
     feeling of a hot neighborhood party, with people of all 
     ages and races.  The MUSIC percolates, and Christy starts 
     to move to it.  She and Mary Robert find a table in the 
     corner, and signal a nearby waitress.

                               CHRISTY
               A couple of bowls of chili.
                             (holding up the beer)
               And another round of these.

     The waitress looks at the two women strangely; the club 
     has never hosted nuns before.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (to the waitress, 
                             confidentially)
               I have to do this.  So I can become a 
               nun.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the waitress)
               Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, 
               we make her wear her underwear on her 
               head.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Really?

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the waitress)
               And she wants to be a nun.

     The waitress leaves, shaking her head.  Christy and Mary 
     Robert watch the action at the club.

     Across the room, MIKE the bartender stares at the nuns, 
     especially Christy; he tries to place her.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Who are all these people?

                               CHRISTY
               This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. 
               You should get to know 'em.

     From across the room, Mike the bartender continues to 
     study Christy's face.  He takes out a copy of Vince's fax 
     photo and stares at it.  He covers Christy's hair in the 
     photo with his hands, creating a wimple.  There is no 
     question in his mind; the two are the same.  Mike has a 
     dangerous look in his eyes as he takes a gun from the 
     drawer and slips it into his pocket beneath his apron.

     There is a LIVE BAND on a small stage at one end of the 
     club.  They start playing a hot dance number, and the club 
     really begins to cook, as the dance floor fills.  Christy 
     and Mary Robert, both still seated, start to move with the 
     music.

     A very good-looking LOCAL DUDE comes over to the nuns 
     table.  He is clearly amused at their presence.

                               DUDE
               Hey, Sisters -- how you doin'?

                               CHRISTY
                             (flirting)
               Better now.

                               DUDE
               How come they let you out?  Out of that 
               convent place?

                               CHRISTY
               Time off.  For bad behavior.

                               DUDE
               Oww!  A nun havin' fun!  I don't believe 
               it!  It's good to have you ladies in this 
               fine establishment.  So... anybody on the 
               move?

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (standing up)
               I am.

     Page 54.

                               CHRISTY
               Bob!  What're you doing?

     Mary Robert leads the Dude out onto the dance floor.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I'm getting experience.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the Dude)
               You watch yourself!

     Christy decides she'd better keep an eye on Mary Robert; 
     she grabs another DUDE, and heads for the dance floor.

     As the music percolates, Christy and Mary Robert dance;  
     Christy is very hot, and Mary Robert picks up on her moves.  
     The CLUB PATRONS are delighted, and cheer as the nuns start 
     to get down.

                               CLUB PATRON #1
               Do it, Sisters!

                               CLUB PATRON #2
               Sway and pray!

     As the song, and the nuns' exuberant dancing, peak, the 
     Club Patrons cheer, shouting "Hallelujah!" and "Amen!"

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Christy and Mary Robert are walking back to the convent. 
     They are both in very good spirits.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Those people are wonderful!  Why don't 
               we ever see them in church?

                               CHRISTY
               Good point.  Especially that dude you 
               were with.  I'd like to see him down 
               front.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (giggling)
               Mary Clarence!  You're so... different 
               from the other sisters.  Sometimes, 
               well... sometimes you sound more like a 
               layperson.

                               CHRISTY
               Honey.

     As the two women laugh together, they don't notice the car 
     that begins to follow them, creeping slowly forward with 
     its headlights out.

     Page 55.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother 
               about all my experiences.  I've learned 
               so much.

                               CHRISTY
               Well, you know, you don't have to tell 
               her everything.  I mean, nothing really 
               happened.  We just... took a walk.

     The car's bright lights suddenly switch on, and the nuns 
     turn, startled.  The car hurtles toward them.  They scream, 
     and Christy grabs Mary Robert and throws her out of the 
     car's path; the two women land on a pile of garbage bags.

     Struggling to her feet, Christy sees the car go into 
     reverse, and then pull forward again.  She sees a glint of 
     light reflect off a gun as the car's driver (Mike the 
     bartender) leans out the window.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Mary Robert)
               Run!

     Christy shoves Mary Robert towards an alley.  As she does 
     so, the gun GOES OFF with a red flash.  The shot misses the 
     two women and SHATTERS a plate glass window of the store 
     behind them.

     EXT. ALLEY

     Running up the alley, Christy and Mary Robert hear Mike's 
     FOOTSTEPS chasing them, growing louder as he gains on them.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence! 

                               CHRISTY
               Keep moving!

     Christy grabs the ladder of a fire escape, and shoves Mary 
     Robert up the ladder ahead of her.

                               CHRISTY
               Climb!  Now!

     As Christy and Mary Robert climb the fire escape, another 
     GUNSHOT ECHOES in the alley, ricocheting off the fire 
     escape.

     The nuns climb higher up the building.  Mike pursues, 
     looking for a shot between the steps and the landings, but 
     not finding any openings.  He takes the steps two at a time 
     and begins to gain ground.

     At the fourth floor landing, Christy's heel gets stuck in 
     the grating.  She pulls frantically at the laces.

     Page 56.

                               CHRISTY
               Goddamn it!

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence!

     Mike arrives at the landing just as Christy twists her 
     toot out of the shoe, and surprises him with a lunge for 
     the gun.  Mike's hand is knocked back against the metal 
     frame of the fire escape, and the gun flies loose, RATTLING 
     down the metal steps to the landing below.  Christy shoves 
     Mary Robert into the open window of an apartment, and 
     follows her in.

     INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT

     Christy and Mary Robert leap into the bedroom of an 
     Hispanic couple, their arms wrapped around each other in 
     bed.  At the women's entrance, the couple looks up, stunned 
     to see two nuns in their bedroom.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Oh my Lord!

                               CHRISTY
                             (pushing Mary Robert 
                             forward)
               Experience!

     The couple continues to look stunned as the nuns race out 
     of the room.

     EXT. CONVENT - NIGHT

     Christy and Mary Robert run up to the side door of the 
     convent; they catch their breath.

                               MARY ROBERT
               What was all that?  Who was that man?  
               Why would he shoot at us?

                               CHRISTY
               I don't know, some people just don't 
               like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.

                               MARY ROBERT
               We could have been killed!  But you 
               saved me!
                             (throwing her arms 
                             around Christy)
               Thank you, Mary Clarence!

     The door to the convent swings open.  Mother Superior is 
     waiting.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes -- thank you so much.

     Page 57

     INT.CONVENT CORRIDOR - DAY

     Christy sits alone outside Mother Superior's office, 
     listening to the loud TICKING of the clock on the wall. She 
     seems small and vulnerable, like a child sent to the 
     principal's office.

     The door opens and Eddie emerges from the office.

                               CHRISTY
               What'd she say?

                               EDDIE
               You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't 
               want you back.

                               CHRISTY
               Does she know people are trying to kill 
               me out there?

                               EDDIE
               She's counting on it.  She's concerned 
               for your safety, but she wants me to try 
               and find another convent that will take 
               you. Or a carnival.

                               CHRISTY
               So what am I supposed to do in the 
               meantime?

                               EDDIE
               Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt. 
                             (urging her)
               Go.

     Reluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door.  She 
     looks at Eddie, who motions her to go in.  She finally 
     does.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     Mother Superior is working on some papers at her desk as 
     Christy enters.  Christy is trying to figure out a 
     strategy.

                               CHRISTY
               So... hi there.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (not amused and not 
                             looking up)
               I don't believe we have anything to say 
               to each other.

                               CHRISTY
               Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm 
               incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I 
               wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would 
               happen!

     Page 58.

     Mother Superior glances up from her work.  She is 
     justifiably outraged.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your 
               behavior was inexcusable!

                               CHRISTY
               I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for 
               it to happen!  And I was the one they 
               were shooting at!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence, I have given you every 
               opportunity.  To change.  To make a 
               decent life for yourself.

                               CHRISTY
               A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A 
               janitor?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Clearly, you have learned nothing. And 
               you present an ongoing threat, both to 
               this convent and to yourself.

                               CHRISTY
               But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to 
               kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! 
               Aren't you supposed to have compassion? 
               For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a 
               major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of 
               Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come 
               true?  Your Olympic event?

     Mother Superior stares at Christy.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.

                               CHRISTY
                             (surprised)
               I am?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You may stay.  But I shall restrict your 
               activities to but a single task.

                               CHRISTY
                             (with great dread)
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You have, I believe, some minimal 
               background in music.  Therefore, you are 
               to join our choir.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
               You will sing, and you will sleep,' that 
               is your schedule until you depart.  As 
               almost no one attends Mass, you will be 
               unable to cause further damage.

                               CHRISTY
               No.  No.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (smiling)
               You're my Olympic event.

                               CHRISTY
               Not the choir, please, anything but 
               that.  The choir -- I mean, have you 
               heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub 
               floors, toilets, you name it, but not 
               that I

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (in triumph)
               The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the 
               gold.

     INT. CHOIR REHEARSAL ROOM - THAT DAY

     There are twelve nuns in the room, going over sheet music. 
     Mary Lazarus is the group's leader; Mary Patrick and Mary 
     Robert are also in the choir.  Christy appears at the door, 
     grimacing.

                               CHRISTY
               Is this... choir practice?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.

     Christy spots Mary Robert.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last 
               night...

                               MARY ROBERT
               Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me.  
               You were only trying to help, to give me 
               experience.  I tried to explain that to 
               Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if 
               she understood.

     Mary Lazarus cuts off this chitchat, thrusting a hymnal at 
     Christy.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Soprano or alto?

                               CHRISTY
                             (very gloomy)
               Whatever.

     Page 60.

     Mary Lazarus hands Christy a hymnal, and raps her baton. 
     The choir begins to sing; Christy doesn't even bother 
     trying.  She is horrified; the choir is the worst-sounding 
     group in history.  They seem to be singing in several 
     random keys, and they even have trouble with the words.  No 
     one looks up from their hymnals.  Sister Alma, the organist 
     with the hearing aid, is plodding along.

     INT. BLUE COLLAR BAR - DAY

     Mike the bartender is taking chairs off tables and setting 
     them on the floor as Joey and Willy enter.

                               JOEY
               We're looking for Mike.

                               MIKE
               You found him -- but we're not open yet.

     Willy grabs Mike's arms and bends them behind his back.

                               MIKE
               Hey -- the till's empty!

     Willy slams Mike's face into the wall, stunning him.  Joey 
     lifts Mike's groggy face and offers sympathy.

                               JOEY
               I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into 
               him.

                               MIKE
               Who are you guys?

                               JOEY
               We're the guys from Vegas.  You had 
               Christy last night, but you let her get 
               away.  It's upsetting.

     Willy hammers Mike's face into the wall again.

                               MIKE
               But you didn't tell me!

                               JOEY
               We didn't tell you what?

                               MIKE
               That she's a nun!  That chick you're 
               looking for -- she's a nun!

                               WILLY
               What?  Christy?

     Page 61.

                               JOEY
               A nun?

                               MIKE
               I'm telling you!

     Willy and Joey look at each other, and consider this.  
     Then they burst out laughing.  They refuse to believe 
     Mike's story.

                               WILLY
               Gimme a hand here.

     Willy and Joey pick Mike up, and hurl him over the bar. 
     Then they exit, still laughing.

                               JOEY
               A nun!

     INT. CHOIR REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

     The choir continues its dreadful rendition of the hymn 
     Let Thy Thoughts He Guided.  Christy is not singing; she 
     is clearly in pain.  Mary Lazarus stops the song.  One of 
     the nuns has to nudge Sister Alma to stop her playing.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Mary Clarence, are you with us?

                               CHRISTY
               Um, I don't really know this one...

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence has a background in music. 
               That's what Reverend Mother said.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (eagerly)
               Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a 
               choirmistress?

                               CHRISTY
               Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (circling Christy)
               Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I 
               don't see?  You think I took vows 
               yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You 
               and Reverend Mother.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               You're a ringer.  She brought you in to 
               replace me.  Out with the old.

     Page 62.

                               CHRISTY
               Hold on.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, 
               you're terrific, but...
                             (to Christy)
               Could you help us?

                               ANOTHER NUN
               Please?

                               ANOTHER NUN
               You've heard us.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Well.

     Everyone falls silent.  Mary Lazarus walks across the 
     room, eyeballing each member of the choir.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               There's a word for this -- mutiny.
                             (to Christy)
               So, Mary Clarence, you think you can do 
               better.  I believe I'd like to see that.
                             (she hands Christy her 
                             pitchpipe and baton)
               I'm out to pasture.  Dry dock.  The glue 
               factory.  Go ahead, Sister -- make 'em 
               sing.

     Everyone watches Christy.

                               CHRISTY
               Well...
                             (to Nary Lazarus)
               With all due respect... let's have a 
               look at this.

     Christy goes over to the piano.  She examines the sheet 
     music for "Let They Thoughts He Guided."  She sits at the 
     piano, beside Sister Alma.  Christy picks out the hymn on 
     the piano, accompanying herself.

                               CHRISTY
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

     Christy's singing voice is, as usual, not very good.  She 
     stops singing.  For perhaps the first time in her life, she 
     has really heard herself.

                               CHRISTY
               Man.  I sound like you guys.

     Page 63.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (victorious)
               Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our 
               lesson?  I won't hold this little episode 
               against anyone.  I'll try not to.

                               CHRISTY
                             (standing)
               Mary Robert.

     Mary Robert jumps, startled by the attention. 

                               MARY ROBERT
               What?

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You 
               never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing 
               comes out.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I don't want to mess anyone up...

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Sister Alma)
               Give me a C.
                             (because Sister Alma 
                             is hard of hearing)
               A C!

     Sister Alma plays the note.  Christy points the baton at 
     Mary Robert.  Mary Robert whispers the note.

                               CHRISTY
               Louder!  Like you're onstage.

     Mary Robert sings a little louder.

                               CHRISTY
               Like people are eating, and there's 
               silverware, and you want them to hear 
               you.

     Mary Robert sings louder still.

                               CHRISTY
               Think about that guy you were dancing 
               with!

     Mary Robert finally lets out her full voice, which is huge 
     and glorious.  After singing a single perfect note, she 
     stops abruptly; she has scared herself.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Oh my!

     Page 64.

                               CHRISTY
               You see?  We've got the voices.  They're 
               just allover the place. I've heard all of 
               you, in the shower --you're decent.  
               Better than me.  We just need charts -- 
               harmony -- chops.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (puzzled)
               Chops?

                               CHRISTY
               The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's 
               rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, 
               you re not a natural soprano, you're an 
               alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with 
               the sopranos.

     The two nuns trade places.

                               CHRISTY
               Sister Alma -- a C.

     Sister Alma plays the note, and the nuns try to duplicate 
     it, but the results aren't much better than before. Christy 
     uses her pitchpipe; she circulates among the nuns, giving 
     each her note, urging them closer to pitch.

                               CHRISTY
               Middle section, hold that note, for dear 
               life.  Sopranos, an A.  Sister Alma?

     Sister Alma hits the note.  Christy shuffles a couple of 
     more nuns to other sections, then gets a third note going 
     with the altos, using her pitchpipe.

     For one moment, the nuns all realize they are singing a 
     perfect chord.  They are elated.

                               MARY PATRICK
               We did it!  We actually sang a chord!

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (thrilled and 
                             disconcerted)
               That was exciting!

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, for one second.  That was the 
               blend -- you've got to listen to each 
               other.  Be a group.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (under her breath)
               I knew that.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you 
               like discipline.  Hard work.

     Page 65.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now.  
               The Lord hates a loafer.

                               CHRISTY
               I hear you.  How many days a week do you 
               rehearse?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Two days.  An hour or so.

                               CHRISTY
               No way.  We're a choir, right? 
               Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a 
               week won't cut it.  Every day.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (impressed)
               She's good.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (to Christy)
               Do you really think we could do it?  Get 
               better?

                               CHRISTY
               I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you 
               think?  They're pretty raw.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Wet behind the ears.

                               CHRISTY
               A bunch of real mama's girls.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Oh, please?  Can't we try?

     Christy and Mary Lazarus look at each other, as real 
     comrades.  Christy leans on Mary Lazarus' shoulder.

                               CHRISTY
               It'll be hell.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Tell me about it.

     Christy and Mary Lazarus shake hands, firmly.  Christy 
     turns to the choir, very businesslike.

                               CHRISTY
               Ten-hut!

     INT. CONVENT LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     This is a basement utility room.     A large industrial 
     washer-dryer stands along one wall; the machine makes a 
     repetitive CHUNG-CHUNG sound

     Page 66.

     The choir nuns are busily doing laundry; some iron, others 
     fold sheets, others stack towels and garments on a long 
     table.  Christy is helping Mary Patrick fold a sheet.  
     Everyone is working rhythmically, to the drone of the 
     washer-dryer.

                               CHRISTY
               That machine.

                               MARY PATRICK
               I know.  It's ancient.

                               CHRISTY
               It's a rhythm section.  The beat.

     Christy starts clapping her hands to the sound of the 
     washer-dryer; gradually, the other nuns join her.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Patrick -- do you remember the 
               Dixie Cups?

                               MARY PATRICK
               The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a 
               girl.  Of course.
                             (singing)
               SPRING IS HERE
               THE SUN WILL SHINE

                               CHRISTY
                             (stopping the beat)
               Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty 
               cheerful person, aren't you?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Am I?

     There is a murmur from all the other nuns -- "Oh, yes.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (as a confession)
               All right, I am, I know it!  All my 
               life, I've just been... upbeat. 
               Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. 
               Even when I was little, I remember my 
               mother used to say, "That child is pure 
               sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a 
               stewardess."

                               CHRISTY
               So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're 
               usually about rejoicing, right? 
               Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't 
               hold back.  Let all that joy go right 
               into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me 
               hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.

     Page 67.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (with real joy)
               SPRING IS HERE
               THE SUN WILL SHINE
               I'LL BE HIS
               AND HE'LL BE MINE
               WE'LL LOVE UNTIL
               THE END OF TIME
               AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE

                               CHRISTY
               Because we're

                               ALL THE NUNS
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL
               AND WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL
               AND WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL
               AND WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED

                               MARY PATRICK
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL OF LOVE!

     The nuns have really gotten into the song, with Christy 
     encouraging them verbally.  They are sounding better and 
     better.

     SISTER MARY FREDERICK, a member of the choir, steps into 
     the laundry room and lets loose with a sudden, piercing 
     whistle.  The nuns immediately stop singing, and a moment 
     later Mother Superior enters.

     The room is quiet except for the sound of the washer-
     dryer. The nuns all get very busy at their laundry tasks.

                               NUNS
                             (in unison)
               Good morning, Reverend Mother.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Good morning, Sisters.

     Mother Superior takes one more glance around, then leaves.

     Now that the coast is clear, the singing begins again, 
     quietly, to the rhythm of the machine.

                               NUNS
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL...

     INT. CHAPEL

     Bishop O'Hara is leading the Sunday Mass.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               Welcome this Sunday morning, 0 ye few 
               and faithful.

     Page 68.

     As usual, the chapel is almost empty, except for the nuns. 
     The choir is in place behind the pulpit.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               The choir, I am told, has elected a new 
               director -- Sister Mary Clarence, who 
               will lead them in Hymn 127.

     Christy nods to the Bishop, and signals to Sister Alma, 
     who begins the accompaniment.

                               CHOIR
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

     They sound fantastic.  Their voices blend with a heavenly 
     harmony as they sing the slow, melodic hymn.  Mother 
     Superior is startled by this new sound.

     EXT. STREET

     Lawanda and her friends glance at the convent with 
     curiosity as the beautiful MUSIC drifts out to the street.  
     A few other heads turn, but with only mild reactions.

     INT. CHAPEL

     At the end of the first verse, Christy signals the choir 
     to stop.  There's a hush in the chapel as Christy glances 
     at the vacant pews.  Then she turns to Sister Alma and 
     nods. Sister Alma strikes a bold, stirring chord.

     Several of the nuns blink.  Bishop O'Hara glances at the 
     organ with surprise.  Mother Superior sits up with a 
     stiffened back and a severe expression.

     As the chord grows in force, Christy gives the choir a 
     beat.

                               CHRISTY
               One, two, three...

     The choir begins a radically new version of the same hymn. 
     Christy strides up and down in front of the choir, 
     transforming the song into a rousing gospel anthem, with a 
     passionate call-and-response format.

                               CHOIR
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED

                               CHRISTY
               What you say?

                               CHOIR
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

     Page 69.

                               CHRISTY
               But how?

                               CHOIR
               BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH

                               CHRISTY
               I think I hear it!

                               CHOIR
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED

                               CHRISTY
               You know, I just might!

                               CHOIR
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

                               CHRISTY AND CHOIR 
               LET THY SPIRIT TAKE WING AND FLY!

     Spontaneous reactions from everyone in the church.

     EXT. STREET

     The gorgeous, exciting MUSIC pours into the street.  
     Everyone turns to look.  Windows open and people glance 
     out. The street takes on a new movement.

     INT. CHAPEL

     The choir really lets loose flow.

                               CHRISTY AND CHOIR
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE STRENGTHENED
               LET THY PRAYERS BE HEARD
               LET OUR LORD REJOICE IN YOUR PRAISE
               LET HIS GOODNESS LIFT YOU TO A HIGHER 
               PLACE
               AND LET LOVE AND PEACE FILL YOUR DAYS

     Lawanda and her friends peer in at the back door of the 
     chapel.  Bishop O'Hara sees them, and beckons them to come 
     in.

                               CHRISTY
               Sister Alma!

     Sister Alma, inspired by Christy and the choir, burns up 
     the organ with a solo.  More people from the street begin 
     to enter; tentative, curious, drawn by the music.

     At the end of the solo, Christy makes a gesture to the 
     choir, and each member produces a tambourine.  The chapel 
     is full of energy, music and life.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Robert!

     Page 70.

     Mary Robert sings, really letting the power of her voice 
     ring out.  She is astonishingly good.

                               MARY ROBERT
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
               BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
               LET THY SOUL TAKE WING AND FLY!

     The new visitors to the church begin to clap in rhythm to 
     the music, and after a few beats, the nuns join in.  Mother 
     Superior is aghast.

     The choir builds to a huge gospel finish, all keeping 
     their eyes on Christy.

                               CHOIR
               LET THY SPIRIT

                               CHRISTY
               You know what we're saying!

                               CHOIR
               LET THY SPIRIT

                               CHRISTY
               I think they hear you!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               LET THY SPIRIT

                               CHRISTY AND CHOIR
               LET THY SPIRIT TAKE WING AND FLYI

     After the final note, everyone in the chapel is 
     exhilarated -- everyone except Mother Superior.  Christy 
     looks out at the congregation that has increased by a dozen 
     or more, including Lawanda and her friends.  Christy looks 
     happier than she has in years.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     The members of the choir are all gathered outside Mother 
     Superior's office, leaning close to the door and listening 
     to her harangue Christy.  They are surprised to find 
     themselves joined suddenly by Bishop O'Hara, and part to 
     let him through.  He leans down to the keyhole and listens.

     INT. OFFICE

     Mother Superior is livid.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Gospel.  A jazz solo on the organ.  What 
               next?  Jesus goes to Rio?  Good Friday-a-
               go-go?  What were you thinking?

     Page 71.

                               CHRISTY
               I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some 
               butts in those seats.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls?  
               This is not a theater.  or a casino.

                               CHRISTY
                             (sincerely)
               Exactly.  People like going to theaters 
               and casinos.  But they think church is 
               for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack 
               the joint.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted 
               the entire choir!

                               CHRISTY
               Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked 
               hard with them.  They gave up their free 
               time, and they loved it.  Those women are 
               happy.  And we can get even better.  We 
               can wake this place up.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Out of the question.

                               CHRISTY
               Please let me try.  I'm begging you.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary 
               Lazarus will resume her leadership of
               the choir.

     Christy is crestfallen.  There is a KNOCK on the door, and 
     O'Hara enters.  The other members of the choir are in 
     behind him like sardines.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               Reverend Mother, I just wanted to 
               congratulate you.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Oh?

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in 
               years.  What a marvelous program. 
               Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be 
               commended.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Well... thank you.

     Page 72.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               I can't wait until next Sunday, when the 
               choir performs again.  Did you see the
               people walk right in from the street? 
               That music, that heavenly music -- it 
               called to them.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Perhaps.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him 
               a personal letter, describing your
               efforts, your bold new fight to keep 
               your little convent alive.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Really?

     Christy has just been eating this up with a spoon.

                               CHRISTY
               Excuse me, Bishop.  Reverend Mother has 
               some other ideas too.  She's too modest 
               to talk about it, but she thinks we 
               should get out of the convent and into 
               the neighborhood more.
                             (putting her hands on 
                             Mother Superior's 
                             shoulders) 
               This woman.

     Mary Patrick jumps forward.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Bless her!  There are so many problems 
               in this neighborhood that we could help 
               solve.  That's why many of us became 
               nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (confused by the turn 
                             things have taken)
               Really...

                               CHRISTY
                             (with regard to Mother 
                             Superior)
               You know Reverend Mother.  Hides her 
               light under a bushel.  She has plans for 
               us to move right onto the streets.  Get 
               to know people.  Work with 'em.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
                             (to Mother Superior)
               You're a pioneer.

     Page 73.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this 
               is a most dangerous neighborhood.

                               O'HARA
               And you'll face that danger head-on.  As 
               if I could stop you.  And you have my 
               complete support in this matter. Anything 
               you can do to revitalize this 
               neighborhood would be a blessing.

                               CHRISTY
                             (hugging Mother 
                             Superior from behind)
               Don't you love her?

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     The nuns are out in force, painting the walls of the 
     convent, mostly with rainbows and flowers and bright, 
     shining suns.  The CAMERA PANS to Christy, who is adding 
     her own original touch to the mural, using cans of spray 
     paint.  Christy's section includes an image of a nun in a 
     miniskirt and spike heels, accompanied by neon letters that 
     read "St. Kate!"  People gather in the street, watching the 
     nuns' activities.  The convent begins to crackle with 
     energy and life.

     A drug deal is going on in a house up the street, but the 
     DEALERS give only a curious glance to the action at the 
     convent.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S WINDOW

     From the window of her office, Mother Superior watches the 
     painters and feels her control slipping away.

     EXT. STREET - LATER

     Christy leads the members of the choir down the middle of 
     the street.  They get lots of attention each step of the 
     way.  As each nun raps, the other nuns make rhythmic boom-
     box noises.

                               CHRISTY
                             (rapping)
               WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE 
               DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (rapping)
               HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO
               DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR 
               YOU

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (rapping)
               BELIEVE IN THE LORD, HIS WILL BE DONE
               COME TO CHURCH, IT'S TONS OF FUN

     Page 74.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (rapping)
               DIG DOWN DEEP, GIVE ALL YOU CAN
               TRUST ME, CHILDREN, THERE'S A HEAVENLY 
               PLAN!

     The parade goes on, the crowd gathers, and a general air 
     of jubilance prevails.

     INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

     The rehearsal room is filled with high energy as the choir 
     is separated into several groups.  Christy has got the 
     whole thing running like a disciplined Broadway cast.

     Mary Patrick leads one group in the corner as they 
     practice synchronized movements with tambourines.  Colorful 
     streamers are tied to the tambourines, and they make 
     colorful patterns in the air.

     Sister Alma pounds the piano with newfound energy, as Mary 
     Robert and the sopranos reach higher and higher for notes 
     they've only dreamed of in the past.

     Christy and Mary Lazarus have corralled the rest of the 
     nuns into a practice of intricate dance steps, somewhat 
     like the Temptations in skirts.  Mary Lazarus keeps the 
     beat with a yardstick.

                               CHRISTY
               Don't look at your feet, and I don't 
               want to see anybody counting.  Make it 
               look easy.  Again!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Right, right, cross with the left, spin 
               and turn!

                               CHRISTY 
               Hopeless I

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Amateurs 2

                               CHRISTY
               Babies

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Again!

     EXT. CRACK HOUSE - NIGHT

     One of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as 
     a car suddenly pulls up to the curb.  He starts toward the 
     car as the DRIVER rolls down the window, but before he gets 
     there, Christy and several nuns surround the car.

     Page 75.

                               CHRISTY
               We're here to pray for you, brother.

                               DEALER
               What?  Get the hell out of here.

                               CHRISTY
               We know you don't want to sell drugs.  
               You just had an unhappy childhood, and 
               maybe a learning disability.  You just 
               need someone to pray for you.

                               MARY PATRICK
               We know you don't want to bring pain and 
               misery to your friends and neighbors. 
               We'll pray to find you some honest work.

                               CHRISTY
               And we know that, even though most 
               people would call you a leech and a 
               parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We 
               know that deep down inside, you're 
               probably even worse.  And so you truly 
               need our prayers.

                               DRIVER
               What is this?  Outta my way!

     The nuns give him room, and the Driver zips off down the 
     street.  A small crowd has begun to gather, and it is 
     growing by the moment, murmuring encouragement for the 
     nuns.  Christy turns to the Dealer, as other cars drive 
     slowly past.

                               CHRISTY
               Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers 
               free  We're going to give free prayers to 
               everyone who drives up to this house.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (to the Dealer)
               We're nuns!

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (to cruising cars)
               Free prayers right over here!  Drive up 
               and get your prayers!

                               DEALER
               You're hassling my customers!  That's 
               not legal!  I know my rights.  This is 
               restriction of trade.

                               CHRISTY
               You wanna call a cop?

     Page 76.

     The Dealer's eyes turn ugly as he takes a gun from his 
     pocket.  Mary Patrick steps forward.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Are you going to shoot us all, tough 
               guy?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses 
               here.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the crowd)
               Can I get a witness?

     The Dealer glances at the surly crowd, then gives the nuns 
     a disgusted look.  He puts the gun away.

                               DEALER
               So I'll find another neighborhood to do 
               my business.  You can' t stop me.

                               CHRISTY
               If we can stop you here, they can stop 
               you there.

     The Dealer turns and walks back to his house with anger. 
     The crowd APPLAUDS and CHEERS.

     The picture suddenly becomes GRAINY, and we hear the voice 
     of a NEWS REPORTER.

                               NEWS REPORTER (V.0.)
               It was a truly remarkable scene, as the 
               nuns from St. Katherine's literally drove 
               the crack dealers from the neighborhood, 
               led by the feisty Sister Mary Clarence.

     CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see a TV screen with an image of 
     the nuns and neighbors still celebrating.  On top of the TV 
     are several framed photographs of Vince Laflocca, his wife 
     and children.

     INT. VINCE LaROCCA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     CONNIE LaROCCA, Vince's wife, watches the TV NEWS STORY 
     and calls to Vince in the kitchen.

                               CONNIE
               Vinnie, get in here.  You gotta see 
               this!

     Carrying a roast beef sandwich and a can of beer, Vince 
     appears from the kitchen and glances at the TV screen to 
     see a shot of the convent.  He looks at Connie and makes a 
     sour face.

     Page 77.

                               VINCE
               What?  Nuns?  You got me in here to see 
               nuns?  Isn't there a ball game on or 
               something?

     Vince turns away from the TV just as a closeup of Christy 
     appears on the screen.

                               CONNIE
               Look -- she's adorable!

     Vince leaves the room, and we see Christy again as she 
     leads the choir.

     INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Eddie is cooking spaghetti in his efficiency apartment and 
     watching the NEWS on TV at the same time.  He pours himself 
     a glass of wine and stirs the spaghetti sauce.

                               NEWS REPORTER
               This tiny convent has experienced an 
               amazing turnaround.  The sisters have 
               revitalized and taken back their 
               neighborhood, all due to the energy and 
               talent of the convent choir, a group led 
               by this gifted young nun.  Tell us, Mary 
               Clarence1 what makes you so special?

                               CHRISTY
                             (trying to appear 
                             modest and nun-like)
               Oh, I'm not special, Bob.  It's just 
               hard work... and prayer.

     Eddie all but spits out his wine.  His eyes are wide as he 
     watches Christy being interviewed.  In one stride, he grabs 
     his hat and coat and is out the door on the run.

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     The Sunday morning bell is CHIMING as crowds of people 
     stream into the convent.  The entire neighborhood looks 
     cleaner, and the people walk with a spring in their step. 
     Three local TV stations have remote news crews on the scene 
     doing follow-ups on the story.

     INT. CHAPEL HALLWAY

     Last in line, Christy follows the other choir members down 
     a hallway toward the chapel.  Suddenly, a hand reaches out 
     and grabs her, and a second hand covers her mouth as she is 
     pulled into an empty cell.

     INT. CELL

     Shocked and terrified, Christy struggles to free herself, 
     but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is Eddie.

     Page 78.

     Eddie releases her, and she falls onto the bed.

                               CHRISTY
               Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!

                               EDDIE
               What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead 
               right now.  What are you doing giving 
               interviews on TV?

                               CHRISTY
               It wasn't my fault!  They just showed 
               up.  It's helping the convent.

                               EDDIE
               You're supposed to be hiding out!

                               CHRISTY
               I really can't talk about it now.  The 
               place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show 
               to do.

                               EDDIE
               Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career 
               opportunity.

                               CHRISTY
               I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's 
               about the choir.  You should hear them.
               They're good.  Really good.  And I 
               taught them.

                               EDDIE
               Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.

                               CHRISTY
               I am?

                               EDDIE
               Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..

                               CHRISTY
                             (flirting)
               Really?  Lieutenant?

                               EDDIE 
               I've been worried about you.

     Eddie sits on the bed beside Christy.

                               CHRISTY
               You mean -- worried about my testimony?

                               EDDIE
               No -- worried about you.  Personally.

     Page 79.

                               CHRISTY
               Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking 
               about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there 
               aren't a lot of guys around here.  I 
               mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.

                               EDDIE
               Me too.

                               CHRISTY
               You're not... seeing anybody?

                               EDDIE
               No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about 
               you.  And now... you've really changed.

                               CHRISTY
               I have?

                               EDDIE
               You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes 
               are shining.  You're rea1ly different...

     Eddie and Christy are gazing into each other's eyes; they 
     are just about to kiss.  Their lips are less than an inch 
     apart.

                               EDDIE
               You're... you're a nun.

     Eddie and Christy jump apart, their intimacy has 
     frightened them both, particularly given Christy's outfit, 
     and their location.

                               CHRISTY
               We're in a convent!

     Christy goes to the door.

                               CHRISTY
               I've got to go.

                               EDDIE
               Just remember - you're a target.  Don't 
               you think Vince has a T.V.?

                               CHRISTY
                             (trying to think 
                             straight)
               I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll 
               try.

     Christy begins to leave, and then she turns, filled with a 
     performer's excitement.

                               CHRISTY
               Magic time!

     Page 80.

     Christy hurries toward the chapel, leaving Eddie to shake 
     his head and wonder.

     INT. CHAPEL

     Sister Alma plays the organ, and the choir hums quietly as 
     Christy addresses the congregation.  Cameras from several 
     TV stations are focussed on her from various places in the 
     chapel.

                               CHRISTY
               This Sunday's hymn is inspired by the 
               lesson of Mary Magdalene.  You know the 
               one.  Mary Magdalene was a young lady 
               with a past.  She was no stranger to sin.  
               She was no stranger to practically 
               everybody.  Many condemned her.  The 
               whole neighborhood.  But one man refused 
               to do so.  One man said, hey now, wait a 
               minute.  Listen to the story.

     Sister Alma starts playing a doo-wop vamp.  Mary Patrick 
     and Mary Robert step forward from the choir, standing 
     beside Christy the way the Ronelles used to do.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey, girls. 

                               MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT
               Hail, Mary.

                               CHRISTY
               Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody 
               hates me.

                               MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT
               Oh-huh.

                               CHRISTY
               People throw stones.  They call me 
               names.  I mean, really.

                               MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT
               Really.

                               CHRISTY
               But -- wait.

                               MARY PATRICK
               What is it, Mary?

                               CHRISTY
               That man -- who is he?

                               MARY ROBERT
               He's a carpenter.

     Page 81

                               MARY PATRICK
               He's not like other guys.

                               MARY ROBERT
               He's decent.

                               MARY PATRICK
               He's kind.

                               CHRISTY
               He's... dreamy.  He's...

                               CHOIR
               Yes, Mary?

                               CHRISTY
               HE'S SO FINE...

     The full choir sings back-up while Christy, Mary Patrick 
     and Mary Robert perform intricate girl group choreography.

                               CHOIR
               DOO- LANG, DOO-LANG, DOO- LANG.

                               CHRISTY/MARY ROBERT/ MARY PATRICK
               WISH HE WAS MINE
               THAT HANDSOME GUY OVER THERE
               THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR

     Sister Alma is surrounded by several STREET KIDS who play 
     guitar, bass and drums to accompany the organ and choir.

     Lawanda and her friends sit in a pew, moving joyously to 
     the music.

     Eddie stands in the back of the chapel, watching a Christy 
     he has never seen before.  Christy is now glowing with 
     happiness and confidence.

     As the song continues, we see the chapel is packed to the 
     rafters.  A tin bucket is passed around as a collection 
     plate, and it overflows with money.

     EXT. CONVENT

     Church services are over, and happy people stream out of 
     the convent, but they don't hurry home.  Standing in 
     groups, they talk pleasantly and make plans for the day. 
     There is a real sense of neighborhood up and down the 
     block.

     Eddie comes down the steps, glances back at the convent, 
     smiles to himself, then crosses the street to his car.

     Page 82.

     INT. CHAPEL

     Christy and the choir stare at the collection plate that 
     is filled with money.

                               CHRISTY
               Jackpot!  Two buckets

                               MARY PATRICK
               This is so exhilarating!  All week long, 
               I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I'd rather sing than do anything!

                               MARY PATRICK
               It's better than ice cream.

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's better than springtime.

                               CHRISTY
               It's better than sex!

     Everyone looks at Christy with astonishment.

                               CHRISTY
                             (catching herself)
               I imagine.

     Everyone's attention suddenly turns to Bishop O'Hara as he 
     approaches.

                               O'HARA
               Better and better, Sisters, you are 
               truly an inspiration.  And I bear 
               gladsome tidings.

     The choir gathers around O'Hara with curiosity.

                               O'HARA
               I've kept the Cardinal informed of your 
               progress in the neighborhood.  He has 
               been most impressed.  And he has invited 
               you to attend a special evening Mass at 
               St. Matthew's Cathedral on Sunday night1 
               to sing for the Council of Cardinals.

     The choir reacts with an excited buzz:  "The Council of 
     Cardinals!", "What shall we sing?", etc.

     Mother Superior appears, from the center aisle.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               That is indeed glorious news, Bishop. We 
               will be honored to appear.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
               And on such an occasion, I feel a 
               completely traditional program will be 
               best.

                               CHRISTY
               What do you mean?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The council of Cardinals is perhaps the 
               most esteemed body in the entire Catholic 
               church.  They command the utmost respect.  
               Your more... secular entertainment would 
               be wholly out of place.

                               MARY PATRICK
               But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves 
               our new style.

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's brought people back to the church.

                               CHRISTY
               Isn't that why we were asked to sing for 
               those Cardinals?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I believe this can be settled by a 
               simple vote.

                               CHRISTY
               A vote?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is 
               not a totalitarian state.  Most major 
               decisions are made by the membership as a 
               whole.  A membership that, I am certain, 
               will vote in a rational and pious manner.  
               All those in favor of allowing Mary 
               Clarence to select a program?

     All the nuns look at one another.  Then, slowly, one by 
     one, they all raise their hands.

     Mother Superior is pure steel at this moment; her 
     expression betrays no emotion.  Christy, on the other hand, 
     is quite confused.

                               CHRISTY
               But... wait a minute...

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The majority has spoken.

     Page 84.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               Reverend Mother, as always, you are a 
               true leader.  Gracious and understanding.

                               MARY ROBERT
               It will be wonderful, Reverend Mother. 
               You'll see.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (gesturing to Christy)
               She's a pro.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I am certain the presentation will be a 
               great success.  Congratulations, Mary 
               Clarence.  And congratulations to you 
               all.

     The nuns cheer, and cluster around Christy, chattering 
     about the upcoming concert, as Mother Superior strides off.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     Seated at her desk, Mother Superior glances up as Christy 
     enters.

                               CHRISTY
               You sent for me?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You have a phone call.

     Mother Superior continues with her paperwork as Christy 
     picks up the phone.

                               CHRISTY
               Hello?

                               EDDIE'S VOICE
               Good news, kid.  I pulled a few strings 
               the judge has agreed to move the trial
               up.  We'll be in court in a couple of 
               days.

     With mixed emotions, Christy speaks softly.

                               CHRISTY
               That soon?

     Mother Superior is a very interested eavesdropper.

                               EDDIE'S VOICE
               Forty-eight hours -- and you'll be a 
               free woman.

     Page 85.

                               CHRISTY
               Great.  That's good to hear.

                               EDDIE'S VOICE
               Hey, don't thank me or anything.

                               CHRISTY
               Right, right -- thanks.

     Christy hangs up the phone.  She looks at Mother Superior.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey -- your prayers have been answered.  
               I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Really.  Well, that makes two of us.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I have submitted my resignation to 
               Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked 
               to be relocated as soon as possible.

                               CHRISTY
               But -- why?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I must go where I can be of use.

                               CHRISTY
               But -- there's so much more to do right 
               here.  And look, if it's about me, I 
               mean, I'm gone.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks?  
               I have been here thirty years.  And yet, 
               it would seem, I know nothing.

                               CHRISTY
               But everything that's happening is good!  
               You can be a part of it!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is 
               one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into 
               town and declare a holiday.  You have 
               raised the Sisters' expectations, you 
               have excited and confused them.  They 
               imagine this neighborhood to be some sort 
               of delightful ongoing block party.

                             (MORE)

     Page 86.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
               You and I know that life is not so 
               simple.  There will be disappointments.  
               Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished.  
               How... fortunate.

                               CHRISTY
               Okay, so I just got things started.  But 
               you could build on that.  You could keep 
               it going.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to 
               have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, 
               Mary Clarence.

                               CHRISTY
               But...

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Good day.

     Christy, frustrated, leaves the room.  Mother Superior 
     looks up, she is truly torn, a proud woman unsure of her 
     choices.

     EXT. CONVENT - NIGHT

     The moon casts shafts of silver light down to the 
     courtyard of the convent.  Most of the lights in the 
     neighborhood are out at this late hour.

                               CHRISTY'S VOICE
                             (whispering)
               Come on... I've got a surprise...

     INT. CONVENT KITCHEN - NIGHT

     The kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle 
     carried by Christy.  Three more candles appear, carried by 
     Mary Robert, Mary Patrick and Mary Lazarus.  The door to 
     the freezer opens, and light spills out.  Christy removes 
     several pints of ice cream and distributes them to the 
     nuns.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (delighted)
               Ice cream!

                               MARY PATRICK
               Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. 
               Where did you get this?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               It's a sin.  It's a wicked indulgence. 
               Is this butter almond?

     Page 87.

     Christy and the nuns sit on stools, enjoying their ice 
     cream by candlelight.

                               CHRISTY
               It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I 
               wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... 
               thank-you gift.

                               MARY ROBERT
               A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one 
               we should be thanking.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Is there any syrup?

                               CHRISTY
               Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't 
               always... real popular.  I was sort of 
               selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, 
               I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. 
               But now, thanks to all of you... maybe 
               I'm shaping up.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're 
               an example to us all.  You've taught us 
               so much.  We're singing for the 
               Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe 
               the choir can travel -- to schools, and 
               nursing homes.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Maybe we can get some of the local kids 
               to sing with us.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.

                               CHRISTY
                             (knowing she has to 
                             leave)
               That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of 
               course, we never know when things are 
               going to change.  Any one of us could be 
               transferred to another convent, tomorrow.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (worried)
               Are you leaving us?

                               CHRISTY
                             (sincerely)
               Oh no.  We'll always be together.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               That's what Diana Ross said.

     Page 88.

     Christy and the nuns qiggle, and continue eating their ice 
     cream, in a spirit of true friendship.

     Mother Superior watches this scene, hidden in the shadows 
     by the door to the kitchen.  She has begun to see Christy 
     in a new light.  She looks thoughtful, and walks off.

     INT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

     Tate sits at his desk in the detective room, reading the 
     sports section.  HENRY PARKER, the accountant for the 
     police department, looks stressful as he enters the room 
     and heads for Eddie's glassed-in office.  Tate glances up 
     as Parker passes his desk.

                               TATE
               You're too late.  Mulcahy just left.

                               PARKER
               I need his signature on some things. 
               They can't be processed without it.

                               TATE
               Leave 'em.  He'll sign 'em later.

     Parker looks annoyed -- he doesn't like deviations from 
     procedure -- but after a moment of indecision, he sets the 
     file folder on Tate's desk and walks away.

     Tate finishes the newspaper and shoves it aside.  Bored, 
     looks at his watch, then flips the file folder open and 
     glances at its contents;  routine money vouchers for 
     equipment, supplies, etc.  Tate is about to close the 
     folder and shove it aside when something catches his eye.

                               TATE
               What the hell is this...?

     He examines a money voucher for a generous donation to St. 
     Katherine's Convent in San Francisco.  It only takes a 
     moment to put two and two together, and Tate scrambles for 
     his phone and dials a number.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Henry Parker waits for the elevator.  When it opens, he's 
     surprised to see Eddie step out.

                               PARKER
               Tate said you were gone.

                               EDDIE
               I get all the way down to my car, and, 
               of course -- where are the keys?

     Page 89.

                               PARKER
               I left the money vouchers with him.  He 
               said you'd sign them in the morning.

     Eddie nods and moves on as Parker enters the elevator. 
     After a few steps, Eddie suddenly looks disturbed.  He 
     picks up his pace.  A little panicky, he begins to jog 
     toward the squad room.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

     Vince is on the telephone.  He signals Joey and Willy, and 
     they move quickly toward him.

                               VINCE
               This is it.  Get ready to move.  No 
               mistakes.  Grab her, get her to the 
               Moonlight.  We meet there, and we take 
               care of her.
                             (into phone)
               We're on it.  Give me the address.

     Vince begins to write down the address.

     INT. SQUAD ROOM

     Tate is hunched over the telephone, talking quietly with 
     his back to the rest of the room.  The voucher for St. 
     Katherine's is in his hand as Eddie moves quickly toward 
     him.

                               TATE
               St. Katherine's Convent on East Barton. 
               It's gotta be the place.

     Tate hangs up the phone and BOOM!  Eddie hits him from 
     behind like a linebacker, drilling him to the floor.  Other 
     detectives look up from their desks with confusion and 
     alarm.  Eddie pins Tate to the wall and snatches the 
     voucher from his hand.

                               EDDIE
               You're the leak, you son-of-a-bitch!

     Clarkson and another detective restrain Eddie before he 
     can hit Tate.

                               EDDIE
               Get him out of here!  Downstairs, in the 
               cell!  I want his ass locked up now!

     Nobody dares even question Eddie at this moment, and two 
     detectives drag Tate away.  Eddie grabs Tate's phone and 
     dials long distance.

                               EDDIE
               Clarkson, get on the other line.  Call 
               Frisco Central.  Tell 'em to get two 
               squad cars outside St. Katherine's 
               convent, and stop anybody with an out-of-
               state license plate from getting near the 
               place.

     Clarkson dials quickly.  Eddie listens to Tate's telephone 
     as it RINGS and RINGS and RINGS.

     INT. CONVENT - DAY

     All the nuns are in the chapel as the choir rehearses a 
     hymn, along with Gina and her girlfriends.  Those who are 
     not in the choir clap their hands in rhythm.  War in the 
     background, we can hear the telephone RINGING.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

     Eddie's police car streaks past an entrance ramp with the 
     SIREN screaming.  It blazes through traffic, weaving in and 
     out at breakneck speeds.  A moment later, Joey and Willy 
     pull onto the highway at a fast rate.  The race is on, with 
     Eddie securely in the lead.

     INT. CONVENT - DAY

     In the rehearsal room, the choir members are putting on 
     their robes.  Christy and several nuns are all trying to 
     primp in front of one small mirror.

                               MARY ROBERT
               The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so 
               nervous!  What if I forget the words?

                               CHRISTY
               Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is 
               that bus?

                               MARY PATRICK
               It should be here any minute.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (with a clipboard)
               Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 
               8:30.  Sharp.

     Christy looks out the window, but sees no bus.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

     Eddie's police car streaks toward L.A.

     Page 91.

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     The neighborhood has turned out to see the choir off.  
     Banners hang from the fire escapes of the building across 
     the street:  "ST. KATE'S - THE GREATEST!", "GOOD LUCK 
     TONIGHT!"

     A Catholic school bus pulls up to the convent and parks in 
     front.  Several nuns in choir robes come outside and hurry 
     onto the bus.  A moment later, Eddie's police car streaks 
     up to the side entrance of the convent, parking around the 
     corner from the bus.

     INT. CONVENT

     Eddie runs into the convent and finds Mother Superior at 
     the bottom of the stairs.

                               EDDIE
               Reverend Mother!  Quick!  Where's 
               Christy?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               What's wrong?

                               EDDIE
               They know she's here!   They're on their 
               way!

     Mother Superior points up the stairs.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The rehearsal room!

     Mother Superior looks alarmed as Eddie takes the stairs 
     two at a time.

     INT. REHEARSAL ROOM

     Looking out the window, Mary Robert sees the bus.

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's here!  Let's go!

     Everyone makes a final check of their appearance, and then 
     the group leaves the room to head for the bus.  Mary Robert 
     and Mary Patrick are the last to leave, except for Christy.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Hurry, Sister!

                               CHRISTY
               Get moving.  I'm right behind you.

     Christy primps in the mirror one last time, then leaves 
     the room.  She is puzzled to suddenly see Eddie running 
     toward her from a side staircase.

     Page 92.

                               CHRISTY
               Eddie...?

     Eddie grabs her hand and pulls her toward the side 
     staircase.

                               EDDIE
               Vince knows you're here.

                               CHRISTY
                             (shocked and scared)
               How?

                               EDDIE
               Long story.  His goons will be here any 
               minute.  We've got to get you out of here 
               '- now!

     Christy and Eddie hurry down the steps to the side 
     entrance, and she almost trips on her choral robes.  Eddie 
     opens the door and starts outside, but Christy stops in her 
     tracks.

                               CHRISTY
               I can't go with you.

                               EDDIE
               What?

                               CHRISTY
               I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's 
               Cathedral.  We're singing for the 
               Cardinals.

                               EDDIE
               You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if 
               you don't get your ass out of here!

     Eddie jerks her hand, and Christy follows him reluctantly 
     to the car.

     INT. EDDIE'S CAR

     Eddie takes off at a fast clip up the street.  As the car 
     cruises through an intersection, Christy looks back at the 
     bus with confusion and sadness.  She sees the other nuns 
     rushing back into the convent to look for her.

     INT. REHEARSAL ROOM

     Several members of the choir rush into the room with panic 
     in their eyes.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Mary Clarence!  Sister!

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's no use.  She just isn't here.

     Page 93.

                               MARY PATRICK
               It doesn't make any sense.  She was 
               right behind me...

     The HORN on the school bus blows loudly down in the 
     street.

                               MARY ROBERT
               We can't sing without her!  What should 
               we do?

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (calming herself)
               We'll pray -- and she'll be there.

     The nuns are calmed by the tone of Mary Patrick's voice. 
     They leave the room to join the others on the bus.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Eddie's police car streaks through crowded streets.

     INT. EDDIE'S CAR

     Christy still looks unsettled.

                               CHRISTY
               Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They 
               won't sing without me.  I'm deserting 
               them.

                               EDDIE
               I think they'd understand.

                               CHRISTY
               That's not the point!  They need me!

     Eddie glances at her, impressed by the influence the 
     convent has had.

                               EDDIE
               They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For 
               what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?

                               CHRISTY
               You don't get it!  It's a big thing for 
               them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. 
               Prime-time.  They're singing for the 
               Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." 
               If first prize was a trip to the Vatican.  
               They've worked really hard, they deserve 
               this.

                               EDDIE
                             (goading her)
               Nuns?

     Page 94.

                               CHRISTY
               They're not nuns.  They're like.. 
               people.  With one outfit.

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     Joey and Willy park their car in front of the convent, get 
     out quickly and climb the steps to the front door.  They 
     ring the bell.

                               JOEY
               So that guy in the bar was right?  She's 
               like... some kind of nun?

                               WILLY
               Yeah, right -- when I see it.

     Lawanda and her friends watch Joey and Willy pounding on 
     the convent door.

                               LAWANDA
               You dudes looking for nuns?  They all 
               went to St. Matthew's.

                               JOEY
               St, Matthew's?  Thanks.

                               LAWANDA
               Praise the Lord.

     Joey and Willy run past the girls, get into their car and 
     take off.

     INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

     Eddie glances at the dashboard and sees that the fuel 
     gauge is close to empty.  He wheels into a gas station and 
     pulls up to the tanks.  Christy starts to open the door, 
     but he stops her.

                               EDDIE
               What're you doing?

                               CHRISTY
               Even nuns have to pee.

     He lets her go, then gets out to pump gas.

     INT. WOMEN'S ROOM

     Christy enters the bathroom; it is deserted.  She fondles 
     her rosary beads, and sinks to her knees.  This position 
     doesn't work for her; she stands.  She looks around her; 
     she glances up, toward heaven.  She decides to do things 
     simply, and speaks in a matter-of-fact tone.

     Page 95.

                               CHRISTY
               Okay, it's me.  Mary Clarence.  Christy. 
               It's Chris Carter.  I need some help 
               here.  I can't believe I'm doing this. 
               Okay, look, I know I should just get back 
               in the car, and get the hell out of here.  
               Save my skin.  I mean, it's not wrong, 
               Vince really wants to kill me. Why do you 
               make guys like Vince?  But if I don't 
               sing at St. Matthew's... Mary Robert.  
               Mary Patrick.  It means so much to them.  
               They're counting on me -- and I like 
               that.  Maybe Reverend Mother is right, 
               maybe I am a bad influence, maybe I'm 
               just some Vegas slut, but... can we cut a 
               deal here?  I mean, I still don't believe 
               in, like, most of the Commandments, and 
               stuff in church still gives me the 
               willies, but -- if I go back and sing, if 
               I do a good deed, will you promise I 
               won't get killed?  All I want is a sign.  
               Lightning.  Thunder. Anything.

     Suddenly, Christy hears the toilet FLUSH in the next 
     bathroom.

                               CHRISTY
                             (in disbelief)
               No.  No.  Doesn't count...

     Suddenly, Christy hears "AVE MARIA" coming from a radio or 
     TV outside the bathroom.  She looks up; a ray of sunlight 
     illuminates a grimy, dime-store Christmas tree ornament 
     hanging from a room deodorizer.  The ornament is a glittery 
     angel; it sparkles in the light.

     Christy leaves the bathroom, still not quite sure.

     EXT. GAS STATION

     Christy looks through the grimy window of the gas station 
     office.  A bored Mechanic is watching a small portable TV. 
     On the TV is an episode of "THE FLYING NUN":  Sally Field, 
     in full habit, is soaring along.

     Suddenly, Christy hears the loud ROAR of a motorcycle 
     starting up over by one of the gas pumps.  The BIKER turns 
     and looks at Christy:  he has long hair, and a beard and 
     moustache, and he looks, well, a bit like Jesus.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh my God...

     Christy runs up to the Biker..

                               CHRISTY
               I'm late for church.  Can I get a lift?

     Page 96.

     Christy swings onto the back seat; the Biker puts his 
     Harley in gear and flies down the street.  Eddie is shocked 
     as he drops some money on the ground and jumps into his car 
     to follow.

     EXT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL - DAY

     We see a network truck parked in front of the landmark 
     cathedral.

     INT. CHAPEL

     There is a sense of chaos in the chapel as TECHNICIANS set 
     up television equipment, and Mother Superior leads the 
     choir as it rehearses.  Near the back of the chapel, Bishop 
     O'Hara looks concerned over the performance of the choir. A 
     CARDINAL walks up to Bishop O'Hara.

                               CARDINAL
               Is this the choir you've been speaking 
               so highly of, Bishop?

                               O'HARA
               They're just a bit nervous.  They'll be 
               fine.

     The choir seems very demoralized as they finish the hymn. 
     Mary Patrick is close to tears.

                               MARY PATRICK
               We sound terrible   We need Mary 
               Clarence.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               We're losing it.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I don't understand.  Where is she?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must 
               proceed without her.  Pull yourselves 
               together.

     Clapping his hands briskly, the FLOOR DIRECTOR suddenly 
     steps forward from behind the TV cameras and hustles the 
     choir away from the altar.

                               FLOOR DIRECTOR
               Okay, Sisters, we have to move on now. 
               That was great, just great.  Charlie, 
               throw a spot on the pulpit.  Let's get a 
               balance.

     Dispirited, the choir leaves the altar and walks toward 
     the back of the church.

     Page 97.

     EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET

     The motorcycle flies through the streets, breaking every 
     traffic law on the books.  Christy's robe flaps behind her 
     in the wind, and she has a wide smile as she rides.  As 
     passersby stare at her, she holds out two fingers and 
     blesses them.

     EXT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL

     Mary Robert stands alone in front of the cathedral, 
     wringing her hands with worry.  Suddenly, her face 
     brightens like the dawn as she sees Christy ride up.

                               MARY ROBERT
               You're here!  Thank goodness!

     INT. CATHEDRAL

     Christy and Mary Robert rush down a side corridor, turn a 
     corner and see two TV Technicians standing near some cables 
     with the letters of the network embroidered on the backs of 
     their jackets.  Christy rushes up to them and taps them on 
     the shoulders.

                               CHRISTY
               Excuse me -- where's the rehearsal room?

     The two Technicians turn toward her, and she is horrified 
     to see they are. Joey and Willy.  Christy gasps as Willy 
     sticks a gun in her ribs.  Joey smiles at her.

                               JOEY
               The rehearsal room is right this way.

     Joey opens a door that leads to an alley behind the 
     cathedral.  Mary Robert looks confused.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?

                               CHRISTY
               They're from my old convent.

     Christy suddenly lifts her knee into Willy's groin, and he 
     buckles over.  She scrambles for the gun, but Joey beats 
     her to it.  Christy looks frantically at Mary Robert.

                               CHRISTY
               Run!  Take off! 

                               MARY ROBERT
               Again?

     Revived Willy lunges for Mary Robert and grabs her.  The 
     two men hustle the two struggling nuns out the door to the 
     alley.

     Page 98.

     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     Joey and Willy wrestle the two nuns to the open door of 
     their car.  They shove Christy and Mary Robert into the 
     back seat, and Willy climbs in next to them.

                               WILLY
               Go!

     Joey starts the car, and it takes off with SQUEALING 
     tires.  Willy has his gun pointed at Christy, who sits 
     beside Mary Robert.

                               MARY ROBERT
               But what do they want?  Where are we 
               going?

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Joey and Willy)
               She's got nothing to do with this.  Let 
               her go.

                               JOEY
               Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what 
               we talked about?  Experience?

                               JOEY
               What?

                               CHRISTY
                             (quickly, to Mary 
                             Robert)
               You can handle this.

     The car comes to a stop at an intersection.  Christy 
     reaches across Mary Robert and opens the car door.  She 
     shoves Mary Robert into the street.

                               CHRISTY
               Go!

     Mary Robert executes a perfect somersault onto the 
     sidewalk.  She looks to heaven, crosses herself and runs 
     back to the cathedral.

     Willy grabs Christy before she can escape.

                               JOEY
               She's gettin' away!

                               WILLY
               Forget her!  We got the one we need! 
               Step on it!

     Joey takes off again.

     Page 99.

     EXT. STREET

     Eddie's car is tied up in traffic, but he turns on his 
     blinker lights and peels over to the opposite lane.  Cars 
     stop to let him through.

     INT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL - DAY

     In the rehearsal room, Mary Robert has just finished 
     telling the nuns what happened to Christy.

                               MARY PATRICK
               You mean -- they kidnapped her?

                               MARY ROBERT
               Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               She shouldn't have come back.  She knew 
               she was in danger.

                               MARY PATRICK
               But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Were they Catholics?

     Mother Superior suddenly steps forward.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               She isn't a nun.  Her real name is 
               Christy Van Cartier, and she is a 
               professional entertainer.  She witnessed 
               a vicious crime, and has been hiding in 
               our convent.

     The nuns all react with shock and emotion.

                               MARY ROBERT
               An... entertainer?

                               MARY PATRICK
               She wasn't a nun? 

                               ANOTHER NUN
               She lied to us?

                               MARY ROBERT
               But... but... she was such a wonderful 
               nun.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Look what she did with the choir.  She 
               made us sing beautifully.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               That should have tipped us.

     Page 100.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't 
               sing without her!

                               MARY PATRICK
               She's our inspiration!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               She's the act!

                               MARY ROBERT
               Reverend Mother, I know that you and 
               Mary Clarence didn't always agree, but --
               we've got to help her.

                               MARY PATRICK
               We've got to save her!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               We can't leave it up to the Feds!

     The nuns all look to Mother Superior for an answer.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, 
               do you have any idea who those men were?

                               MARY ROBERT
               She said they were from her old convent.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't 
               have an old convent.

                               MARY PATRICK
               She told us about one.  The Little 
               Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               All right.  It's a beginning.  Las 
               Vegas, Nevada.

     All the nuns hurriedly cross themselves.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Lazarus, find the Bishop and tell 
               him the situation.  Everyone else --
               follow me.

     Mother Superior leads the way out the door.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     The Driver sits at the wheel of the school bus, reading a 
     sleazy novel.  He looks up as the nuns all converge on the 
     door.

     Page 101

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Emergency!  Open up!

     The Driver opens the door.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The San Francisco airport!  Immediately!

     The nuns are all zooming past the Driver, onto the bus.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (to the Driver)
               Step on it!

     Mary Lazarus grabs the Driver's sleazy novel, confiscating 
     it. The Driver starts the engine.  As the bus drives off, 
     Eddie's car streaks INTO THE SCENE and parks in front of 
     the cathedral.

     INT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL

     Eddie rushes into the lobby and sees Bishop O'Hara.

                               EDDIE
               Where is she?

                               O'HARA
               There was a kidnapping.  We think Las 
               Vegas.

     Eddie turns and races back toward the car.

     EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - NIGHT

     Several small planes are parked on the tarmac.

     Mother Superior and the nuns are arguing with the MANAGER 
     of the airport, a grouchy guy in grease-stained overalls.

                               MANAGER
               Fifteen hundred for the run to Vegas. 
               Rock-bottom.

                               MARY PATRICK
               But we don't have fifteen hundred!

                               MARY ROBERT
               We're nuns!

     The Manager starts back toward his office.

                               MANAGER
               Can't help you.  No exceptions.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Young man!

     Page 102.

     The voice has a powerful ring of authority to it, and the 
     Manager looks around.

                               MANAGER
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR 
               We are nuns.  We pray.

                               MANAGER
               So?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               We pray for good things.  Food for the 
               hungry.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Peace on Earth.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               However, we can also pray for other 
               things.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Measles.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Lawsuits.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Tax audits.

     There is a pause, as the Manager stares at the nuns in 
     horror.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Come, Sisters.  Let's go to chapel.  
               Bring your beads.

     The nuns begin to leave.

                               MANAGER
               Wait!

     EXT. NIGHT SKY - LATER

     A plane sweeps through the desert sky, headed for Las 
     Vegas.  Through the windows of the plane, we see nuns 
     staring out at the glittering city in the distance.

     INT. MOONLIGHT CASINO - NIGHT

     Packed with gamblers, the room is a flurry of activity. 
     Joey works his way through the crowd, then spots Vince near 
     the money cage.

                               JOEY
               We got her.

     Page 103.

     Vince follows Joey out of the casino with a grim 
     expression.

     INT. STORAGE ROOM

     Vince and Joey enter a storage room that is cluttered with 
     boxes.  Christy is tied to a chair in the back of the room, 
     with Willy standing guard over her.

     Christy sits very calmly, despite the anger she is in.  
     She seems distinctly nun-like in her radiant serenity.

                               VINCE
                             (turning on the charm)
               Babe.

     Christy does not reply.

                               VINCE
               Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.

                               CHRISTY
               Good evening, Vincent.

                               VINCE
               What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I 
               know you.  What did you think you were 
               doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out.  
               No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?

                               CHRISTY
               I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.

     Vince, Willy and Joey all look at each other, perplexed.

                               WILLY
               She's a nun, Vince.

                               VINCE
                             (kneeling by Christy)
               I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I 
               gave you so much.  My time.  My 
               affection.  A big-time career.  And how 
               do you repay me?  What's the thanks I 
               get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's 
               the love?

                               CHRISTY
               You will be judged, Vincent.  We all 
               will.

     Vince stands; the charm hasn't worked.  He's getting 
     angry.

                               VINCE
               What do you mean -- judged?  I don't get 
               judged, baby.

     Page 104.

                               VINCE (CONT'D)
               And who are you to talk?  You were 
               nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must 
               have been out of my mind.

                               WILLY
               She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since 
               we picked her up.

                               JOEY
               It's spooky.  It's like she ain't even 
               afraid or nothing.

     Vince grabs the front of Christy's habit and squeezes it 
     tightly around her throat.

                               VINCE
               She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys 
               you're afraid.

                               CHRISTY
                             (calmly)
               I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I 
               forgive you.

     This really throws Vince, and angers him further.  He 
     glares at Christy, and then releases her.  He turns to Joey 
     and Willy.

                               VINCE
               Who gives a damn?  Waste her.

     Joey and Willy look a little unsure as Vince storms out of 
     the room.

     INT. PLANE

     The nuns are mesmerized by the bright skyline with its 
     colorful flashes of neon.

                               MARY PATRICK
               It's so beautiful...

                               MARY ROBERT
                And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And Gommorah.

     The plane sets down at the Vegas airport.  Mother Superior 
     and the nuns climb out.

     INT. BAR AREA

     Joey and Willy find Vince near the bar.

     Page 105.

                               VINCE
               It's done?

                               JOEY
               Not... totally.

                               VINCE
                             (disturbed)
               What's the problem?

                               WILLY
               She's... she's a nun.

                               VINCE
               Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's 
               Christy.  She's a babe!

                               JOEY
               But, Vince, how do you know she didn't 
               like, join up and become a nun when she 
               was in that convent?

                               VINCE
               It didn't happen.

                               WILLY
               She was real quiet and peaceful all the 
               way back in the car.

                               JOEY
               No smart-ass remarks or nothing.

                               VINCE
               I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both 
               you guys to go back there, and both of 
               you shoot her at the same time.

                               JOEY
               Yeah...

                               WILLY
               Right.  That way we'd never know which 
               bullet got to her brain and killed her 
               first.  It could always be the other guy.

     They all look happy with this solution as Joey and Willy 
     leave.

     INT. STOREROOM

     Christy still shows no signs of fear as Joey and Willy 
     take out their guns.

                               JOEY
               Okay, we got one-two-three, and on three 
               we both shoot.  Got it?

     Page 106.

                               WILLY
               Got it.

     Joey points his gun at Christy's left temple, and Willy 
     points his gun at her right temple.

                               JOEY
               One... two...

     Christy closes her eyes.

                               JOEY
               Three!

     Neither man shoots.  They look at each other with anger. 
     Christy opens her eyes.

                               JOEY
               You didn't shoot!

                               WILLY
               Neither did you!

                               JOEY
               I figured if you were gonna, then I 
               wouldn't have to.

                               WILLY
               That's what I figured, too.

     EXT. LAS VEGAS HELIPORT

     The nuns leave the terminal and stand on the sidewalk out 
     front.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But where?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Look!  There she is!

     Mary Patrick is pointing to a group of billboards that 
     feature huge ads for the local hotels and casinos.  The 
     center billboard has a splashy picture of a roulette wheel, 
     the Elvis impersonator, and Christy and the Ronelles.  The 
     bottom part of the billboard shows the name of the 
     Moonlight Casino and Lounge.

                               MARY ROBERT
               The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!

                               MARY PATRICK
               But how do we get there?

     Page 107.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Stand back.
                             (she strides into the 
                             road)
               Taxi!

     INT. CASINO

     Once again, Joey and Willy find Vince.

                               VINCE
               Well?

                               JOEY
               It didn't work, Vince.

                               VINCE
               You were both supposed to put your guns 
               to her head and shoot.

                               WILLY
               We both missed.

                               VINCE
               Okay, so the problem is still the nun 
               outfit, right?

                               JOEY
               Right.

                               VINCE
               So, take it off.

                               WILLY
                             (shocked)
               Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?

                               JOEY
               For like, twelve zillion eternities?

                               VINCE
               I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get 
               her out of the nun outfit, and put her in 
               some clothes.

                               JOEY
               Maybe pants.

                               WILLY
               A sweater.

                               JOEY
               And then we can ice her.  No nun, no 
               evil eye.

     Joey and Willy are very confident about this solution. 
     They strut off, pleased with themselves.

     EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT
     Eddie strides out of the airport; he took a later flight 
     than the nuns.  A squad car is waiting; Clarkson beckons 
     him.

                               CLARKSON
               Lieutenant!

     Eddie jumps in the car.  Clarkson turns on the red bubble 
     light and the SIREN, and the car zooms off.

     INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

     Joey and Willy return to the storage room, looking 
     confident of their mission this time.  Christy glances up 
     at them as they enter, and Willy begins to untie her.

                               WILLY
               We got it all worked out.

     He works the ropes free, and Christy rubs her wrists to 
     get circulation back again.

                               JOEY
               Okay, Christy -- strip.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               JOEY
               That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it 
               off.

     Christy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray.

                               WILLY
               What's she doing?

                               JOEY
               She's praying.

                               CHRISTY
               And God bless Joey and Willy, who are 
               only trying to do their jobs.
                             (faking Latin)
               Pox fibula tibia vobiscum.  Et marcus 
               domino's pizza.  Have mercy.  Amen.
                             (she looks up at the 
                             guys)
               I'm finished now.  Help me up.

     As Joey and Willy bend down to help her up, Christy 
     suddenly grabs their neckties in each hand.  With a fierce 
     jerk, she pulls the neckties with all her might, smashing 
     Joey's head against Willy's.

     Page 109.

     Stunned, Joey and Willy stagger backward, holding their 
     heads.  Christy scrambles out the door while the two men 
     groan in pain.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Joey and Willy burst out of the room with guns drawn.  At 
     the far end of the corridor, they spot a glimpse of black 
     clothing as Christy starts down the stairs.

                               JOEY
               There she goes!  she's taking the stairs 
               I

     They run quickly after her.

     INT. STAIRWAY

     Christy runs down the stairs as a SHOT rings out.  Christy 
     screams and runs even faster.

     INT. CASINO

     A door swings open into the casino, and Christy appears, 
     looking frantic.  A MUFFLED SHOT is heard behind her, and 
     she sprints into the casino.

     Seconds later, Joey and Willy appear.

                               JOEY
               Find Vince and tell him what happened. 
               I'll take this side of the room.

     Willy hurries away to find Vince, and Joey starts 
     searching the crowd.

     EXT. THE MOONLIGHT HOTEL AND CASINO

     Three cabs ROAR up in front of the building and nuns 
     tumble out.

     INT. CASINO ENTRANCE

     The nuns enter the casino and stop dead in their tracks. 
     Before them is a large room filled with glitter and sin, 
     the SOUND of jackpots and crap tables.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Brace yourselves, Sisters.

     In unison, the nuns all cross themselves.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Spread out and look for Mary Clarence. 
               Try to blend in.

     The nuns spread to every part of the room, looking for 
     Christy.

     Page 110.

     INT. CASINO

     A blackjack table; a game is in progress, with several 
     players.  Mary Patrick rushes up to the table.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?

                               MARY ROBERT
               A Benedictine.

     The CROUPIER and the players stare at the two nuns. 

     INT. CASINO

     Christy is making her way past a roulette table.  
     Suddenly, she sees Joey coming toward her, making his way 
     through the crowd.  Christy grabs the arm of a SALESMAN 
     playing roulette.

                               CROUPIER
               Place your bets. 

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the Salesman)
               Red 21.

                               SALESMAN
               You sure?  How do you know?

     Christy looks up to heaven.

                               SALESMAN
                             (to the Croupier)
               Red 21.

     Joey stands at the opposite side of the roulette table, 
     glaring at Christy.  The crowd around the table watches 
     Christy for a moment, then they all put their chips down on 
     Red 21.

     Joey starts working his way around the table toward 
     Christy as the Croupier spins the wheel.  The ball falls 
     into a slot.

                               CROUPIER
               Black 14.

     Everyone at the table turns toward Christy, outraged.  She 
     gives them a reprimanding look.

                               CHRISTY
               Did you learn something?

     Christy suddenly realizes that Joey is almost at her side. 
     She shoves the Salesman against him and runs away.

     Page 111.

     INT. CASINO

     We see two long rows of slot machines, with gamblers 
     working every machine.

     Willy appears at one end of the row, scanning the area for 
     Christy.  He sees a nun crossing at the far end of the row, 
     and she moves out of sight.  Willy heads in that direction. 
     Someone hits a JACKPOT behind him, and he turns toward the 
     sound.  As he does. he sees another nun crossing at the 
     opposite end of the row of machines.  Willy turns again --
     now he sees three nuns crossing at the opposite end.  He 
     looks confused, and doesn't know which way to turn.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     Eddie drives up in the squad car and parks near the back 
     door.

                               EDDIE
                             (to Clarkson)
               Close off the block, but don't move in 
               till I tell you.

     Eddie jumps out of the car and hurries inside.

     INT. BLACKJACK AREA

     As Christy moves past a blackjack game, she suddenly sees 
     Vince moving toward her.  Turning quickly, she moves away 
     from Vince, but suddenly sees Joey coming toward her from 
     the opposite direction.  Trapped for a moment, she has 
     panic in her eyes.  Suddenly she is flanked by Mother 
     Superior and Mary Patrick.

                               CHRISTY
               What are you doing here?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Saving you.  Move!

     The nuns surround Christy and head through the crowd in a 
     cluster.  Joey and Vince pursue them from different 
     directions.  Just before they catch them, Mother Superior 
     barks an order.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Break!

     The nuns split up, each taking a different direction. 
     Vince and Joey look bewildered.

                               VINCE
               Get her!

                               JOEY
               Which one!

     Page 112.

                               VINCE
               The nun!

     Vince, Joey and Willy each pick a nun and follow her.

     Vince catches up to a nun, whom we only see from the rear. 
     He grabs her shoulder.

                               VINCE
               Babe.

     The nun spins around; it is Mother Superior.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sweetheart.

     Vince releases her and frantically searches the crowd 
     again.

     Joey catches up with his nun, only to find it is Mary 
     Patrick.  The shell game has worked; Christy has escaped 
     for the moment.

     INT. SLOT MACHINE AREA

     We FIND Eddie scanning the floor and seeing nuns spread 
     out everywhere.  He talks quietly into his walkie-talkie.

                               EDDIE
               Move in.  Seal off the exits, but don't 
               come inside till I tell you.

     INT. CASINO

     Vince, Joey and Willy run into each other in the center of 
     the casino.

                               WILLY
               There's nuns everywhere!  Hundreds of 
               'em!

     All the nuns suddenly come together, and see that the 
     exits are blocked by Vince and his hoods.  Vince spots 
     Christy in the center of the group.

                               VINCE
               There she is!

                               JOEY
               Which one?

     Christy sees Vince pointing at her.

                               CHRISTY
               Quick, there's another way out of here.  
               Follow me.

     Page 113.

     Christy runs toward a set of glass doors set off to one 
     side.  The other nuns follow her.

                               VINCE
               She's heading for the lounge!  Go!

     Vince, Joey and Willy head for the lounge.

     Across the room, Eddie sees Christy and the cluster of 
     nuns head through the glass doors.  He barks into his 
     walkie-talkie.

                               EDDIE
               Move in -- now!

     INT. LOUNGE

     The lounge is deserted between shows, and all the lights 
     are out.  The mobsters enter with guns drawn.

                               JOEY
               I can't see anything in here!

                               VINCE
               Willy -- hit the lights.

                               WILLY
               Where?

                               VINCE
               Find 'em!

     Willy moves off to find the light switch.  There is a 
     flash of black and white fabric behind some chairs.

                               JOEY
               There!

               Before he can shoot, there is another 
               flash of fabric on the opposite side of 
               the room.

                               VINCE
                             (aiming)
               No -- there!

     And a third flash of fabric near the stage.

                               JOEY
               Over there!

     Willy has found the lights, and the lounge is suddenly 
     brightly lit.  The mobsters blink for a moment, then find 
     all the nuns bunched together in a corner, trying to find 
     an exit.

                               VINCE
               Freeze!  Everybody!

     Page 114.

     The nuns turn and face the mobsters, shielding Christy.

                               VINCE
               Joey?

                               JOEY
               Where is she?

     Christy steps forward, to the front of the stage.

                               CHRISTY
               Right here.  Let the others go -- they 
               have nothing to do with this.

                               VINCE
               Joey -- do it.

                               JOEY
               But, boss -- she's still, you know, a 
               nun.

                               VINCE
               She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some 
               broad!

     Mother Superior steps forward.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (with authority)
               I guarantee you, she is no broad.  She 
               is Sister Mary Clarence, of St. 
               Katherine's Convent.  She is a model of 
               generosity, virtue and love.  You have my 
               word, gentlemen.  She is a nun.

                               WILLY
               Hear that?  Now aren't you glad we 
               didn't shoot her?

     Vince has had enough.  Facing Christy, he raises the gun 
     and points it right between Christy's eyes, only inches 
     away.  The nuns all recoil with horror.

     BLAM!  The gun goes off, but Christy isn't hit.  She 
     blinks her eyes open, shocked to be alive.  Instead, it's 
     Vince who falls, crumpling to the floor, and clutching his 
     shoulder.

     Across the room, Eddie holds a smoking police revolver. 
     The nuns all swarm around Christy joyously.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence -- you're alive!

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (smiling)
               Christy.

     Page 115.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (also smiling)
               Van Cartier.

                               CHRISTY
               You know?  About me?  About everything?

     Christy breaks away from the jubilant nuns. She faces 
     Mother Superior.

                               CHRISTY
               Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Oh?

                               CHRISTY
               You saved my life.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I'm a Christian.

     Police pour into the room and gather up Joey, Willy and 
     Vince.  Eddie walks over to Christy and Mother Superior.

                               EDDIE
               Don't you have a concert to go to?

                               CHRISTY
               That depends.  Sisters, you don't know 
               this, but Reverend Mother's been making 
               all sorts of noises about resigning. 
               That's bad news.  I don't know if we 
               could sing, if we thought that was true.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Not a note.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Impossible.

     Mary Lazarus coughs, and points to her throat, as if she 
     has laryngitis.  All the other nuns imitate her.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Mother Superior)
               Then I guess you're stuck.  Life 
               sentence.  No parole.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Very well.
                             (she turns to Eddie)
               I hold you responsible for all of this, 
               For introducing a lounge act into my 
               convent.  For utterly disrupting our way 
               of life.  And for placing all of us in 
               mortal danger.
                             (sincerely, with a 
                             smile)
               Thank-you.

     Page 116.

     ANGLE on Christy, watching this.  She grins.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. 
               Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So 
               you think, after all this, maybe I really 
               am a nun?

                               EDDIE
               I don't know.  There's only one way to 
               be absolutely sure.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, like what?

     Eddie takes Christy in his arms, and they begin a kiss.  
     As they do so, Vince struggles toward Christy, as two cops 
     hold him back.  He is furious.

                               VINCE
               I was good to you! You re nothing but 
               no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit 
               Tramp!

                               CHRISTY
                             (staring at Vince, 
                             seeing him for the scum 
                             that he is)
               That used to be true, Vince.  I was with 
               you.  But something happened.  And I'm 
               different now.  Real--different.  I've 
               had, well, you might call it -- a 
               religious experience.  And I've got just 
               two words for you.  And those two words 
               are...

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (afraid Christy will 
                             curse)
               Mary Clarence!

                               CHRISTY
                             (grinning, to Vince)
               Bless you.

     EXT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL

     People are pouring into the cathedral.  Among them we see 
     many Cardinals in their red uniforms.

     INT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL

     The choir has gathered together in a small room off the 
     main chapel.  They are putting finishing touches on their 
     choral robes, and are waiting nervously to go on.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (to Christy)
               I just realized -- this is the last time 
               we'll all be together.  We're going to 
               miss you so much.

     Page 117.

     Christy and Mary Patrick embrace.  Mary Patrick is 
     tearful.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey -- you re supposed to be the 
               cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel 
               like Snow White?

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (to Christy, with 
                             humor)
               You re okay -- for a civilian.

     Christy and Mary Lazarus embrace.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Reverend Mother?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes?

                               MARY ROBERT
               Since Mary Clarence came to St. 
               Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped 
               by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer.  
               Is that enough experience yet?  For final 
               vows?

                               CHRISTY
               I don't think so.  What about skydiving?  
               A crank call to Billy Graham?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You have evidenced great maturity, Mary 
               Robert.  We shall have a serious 
               discussion.

                               CHRISTY
               What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think 
               you were right.  I'm just a bad 
               influence.  Sister show biz.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... 
               a little Spandex.

                               CHRISTY
               Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and 
               women priests, and sleeping late?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Don't push it.

     Christy and Mother Superior embrace.

     INT. CHAPEL

     The chapel is packed to the rafters.  The first few rows 
     of pews are occupied by Cardinals.  Television cameras 
     glide up and down the aisles, angling for shots of the 
     altar.

     Page 118.

     The Choir stands together on the altar with Christy in 
     front. Behind them stands a much larger, all-city choir. 
     Christy gives the nod to Sister Alma, and the organ vamp 
     begins.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I WAS DOWNHEARTED

                               CHRISTY
               It's true!

                               MARY ROBERT
               I WAS HELL-BOUND, 
               YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY
               SATAN WAS WAITING

                               CHRISTY
               Don't you know it!

                               MARY ROBERT
               BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME

                               CHRISTY
               What did He say?

                               MARY ROBERT
               HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!

                               MARY PATRICK
               MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER
               I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE

                               CHRISTY
               It's true -- I know her.

                               MARY PATRICK
               DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE

                               CHRISTY
               What a shame!

                               MARY PATRICK
               BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL
               WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS

                               CHRISTY
               Pay attention...

                               MARY PATRICK
               SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!

                               CHRISTY
               Were you wicked?

                               CHOIR
               SING!

                               CHRISTY
               Were you tempted?

                               CHOIR
               SING!
               SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!

     Page 119.

     In the front row, Mother Superior is trying to resist the 
     music.  She gives in, and starts bobbing her head to the 
     beat.  Beside her, Eddie looks very proud as his eyes meet 
     Christy's.

                               CHRISTY
               But I'm fearful!

                               CHOIR
               SING!

                               CHRISTY
               And I'm tearful!

                               CHOIR
               SING!

                               CHRISTY
               YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE

                               CHRISTY/CHOIR
               DO YOUR TROUBLES BIND YOU
               IF YOO'RE DEEP IN WOE
               YOU CAN BANISH GLOOM IF YOU TRY
               FIND A SONG WITHIN YOU
               LET IT FILL YOUR DAYS
               JUST SING

                               MARY ROBERT
               SING!

                               CHOIR
               JUST SING!

                               MARY PATRICK
               SING!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               JUST SING!

                               CHRISTY
               Sing!

                               CHRISTY/CHOIR
               SING AND SAY DEVIL, GOODBYE!

     The entire congregation is ecstatic, as the song concludes 
     with a glorious final flourish.

     FADE OUT:

     THE END
