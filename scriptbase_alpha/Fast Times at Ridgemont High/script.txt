Fast Times at Ridgemont High


FADE IN:

EXT. RIDGEMONT CENTER MALL - NIGHT

From the outside parking lot it looks like an
enormous beached whale. It is the prime hangout for
all the teenagers in the area. Kids mill around the
parking lot or stand by the mall entrance.

INT. RIDGEMONT CENTER MALL

There are three levels of stores underneath a
massive fluorescent roof. Different music comes
from each store. It looks seventies-modern, but
already used and run-down. Groups of kids cruise
the mall, eyeing each other and acting cool.

INT. SWENSON'S ICE-CREAM PARLOR - NIGHT

The teenage waitresses in their peppermint pattie
uniforms are rushing around, trying to keep up with
their orders.

A good-looking man in his mid-twenties enters and
sits. He wears a plastic name tag that says:
"Pacific Stereo Audio Consultant, RON JOHNSON."

Two Swenson's Waitresses pass by with supreme
indifference, and take their orders into the back
kitchen.

INT. SWENSON'S BACK KITCHEN

               WAITRESS #1
     I think he looks like Richard Gere.

The two Waitresses discuss the issue at hand. One
of them, Linda Barrett, is the seventeen year old,
retired sex queen of Ridgemont High.

               WAITRESS #1 (CONT'D)
     I think he looks like... Richard
     Gere. (Bruce Springsteen)

               LINDA
     Did you see his cute little butt?

A third waitress enters.

               WAITRESS #2 
     Let's talk about C-19.

               WAITRESS #1 AND LINDA 
     We were!

               WAITRESS #2 
     I think I'll drop over and change
     the shakers.

               LINDA 
     No, be cool, that's Stacy's
     section.

Through the entrance, we see Stacy Hamilton. She is
the fifteen-year-old trainee, sweet-looking with
just the last traces of baby fat. She puts down a
glass of water for Ron, spills some and mops it up.

               WAITRESS #1 
     He's too old for Stacy, she hasn't
     even started high school yet.

A flustered Stacy enters the back kitchen.

               LINDA 
     How's it going.

               STACY 
     Do you think that guy's cute?

               WAITRESS #1 
     In a blow-dryed kind of way.

               STACY 
     Does anyone else want to take his
     table?

               LINDA 
     Don't you like him?

               STACY 
     Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take
     it. Really.

               LINDA 
     Come on, Stacy, it's your section
     and your man.

               STACY 
     What should I do?

               LINDA
     Just take his order, look him in
     the eye and if he says anything
     remotely funny, laugh a lot.

She fluffs up Stacy's hair and gently shoves her
towards the door. Stacy reluctantly exits.

INT. SWENSON'S DINING ROOM

Stacy goes to Ron's table.

               RON 
     So you working hard or hardly
     working?

Stacy thinks it over, decides it's a joke and
laughs (a little too late). Ron looks at her
soulfully.

               RON (CONT'D)
     You look like you could still be in
     high school.

               STACY 
     I know, everyone says that.

He stares at her and she stares back uncomfortably.

               STACY (CONT'D)
     What can I get for you tonight.

               RON 
     How about your phone number?

Stacy smiles nervously.

INT. RIDGEMONT MALL - OUTSIDE SWENSON'S - NIGHT

A teenage boy stands in front of an in-mall theatre
across from Swenson's. He wears a stiff over-sized
tuxedo suit. He is Mark "The Rat" Ratner, a ticket
taker on the job.

Mike Damone, a transplanted Easterner, bops over
from the record store, eyeing every girl he passes.
He stops at the movie theatre.

               THE RAT 
     Do you ever look at those girls who
     work at Swenson's? They're
     beautiful. And I have to stand out
     here and watch them six nights a
     week.

               DAMONE 
     You should work for yourself.

Two Junior High Kids spot Damone, walk up to him.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     What can I do for you, gentlemen?

               JUNIOR HIGH KID #1
     You the guy with the Van Halen
     tickets?

               DAMONE
     I could be.

               JUNIOR HIGH KID #2
     What do you want for something in
     the first ten rows?

               DAMONE
     Twenty bucks apiece.

               JUNIOR HIGH KID #1
     Those tickets were only twelve
     fifty!

               DAMONE
     So don't buy 'em.

               JUNIOR HIGH KID #2
          (to friend)
     All the other scalpers are sold
     out, Arnold.

Damone reacts indignantly.

               DAMONE 
     Scalper? You call me a scalper? I
     perform a service, my friends. The
     service costs money. Now do you
     want the tickets or not?

The Kids look at each other.

               JUNIOR HIGH KID #1 
     Are you sure you can't go any
     lower.

               DAMONE 
     These are my special back-to-school
     prices.

               JUNIOR HIGH KID #2 
     We'll take 'em.

Damone reaches inside his pants pocket for a wad of
tickets.

EXT. CARL'S JR. - NIGHT

At the other end of the mall is a neon-lit Carl's
Jr. Hamburger Restaurant. If Swenson's was the warm
up, this is the main attraction of the Ridgemont
Mall.

INT. CARL'S JR.

Back-to-school banners hang from the walls. Many
kids are lined up at the counters. In the middle of
the kitchen, directing all the orders, is a
seventeen year old named Brad. He moves
confidently, observing the fryer, checking cup
supply, and giving an affectionate squeeze to a
pretty cashier named Lisa. She lets him kiss her,
but only once.

A teenage Customer shouts to Brad from the front
counter.

               CUSTOMER 
     Hey Brad! I waited till you came
     on! I wanted your fries.

Brad smiles, walks over to the fryer and discards
the fries left from the previous shift. He shouts
to the other employees as he puts in a new batch,
"his" batch.

               BRAD 
     We need fifteen Superstars, David!

               FELLOW EMPLOYEE #1 
     Okay, Brad!

               BRAD 
     I'll take care of the fry orders!
     Just get me the Superstars!

               FELLOW EMPLOYEE #2 
     Fish sandwiches!

Brad spots three surfers sitting in the dining
area. None of them are wearing shirts.

               BRAD 
     Hey you guys! You had shirts on
     when you came in here.

ANGLE ON THE MAIN SURFER

a bleary kid sitting at the head of the table. He
runs a hand through his long, stringy blond hair.
After a time, he speaks.

               SPICOLI 
     Something happened to them, mon.

               BRAD 
     Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you
     just put your shirts back on? See
     the sign?

ANGLE ON HANDWRITTEN SIGN IN WINDOW

that reads: "No Shirts, No Shoes, No Dice"

INT. CARL'S JR.

A store manager, Dennis Taylor, bustles up to Brad.

               DENNIS 
     Any problems?

               BRAD 
     No, just a couple of surfers with
     no shirts on. I took care of it,
     Dennis.

ANGLE ON SURFERS

grumbling, putting shirts back on. It pains them.

Dennis heads back to his office when he sees
something in the trash bin.

               DENNIS 
     Did you throw away those fries,
     Hamilton?

               BRAD 
     They were left over from the last
     shift.

               DENNIS 
     Those were perfectly good fries,
     Hamilton. 
          (glares at Brad)
     Perfectly good.

               BRAD 
     But they weren't mine.

Brad laughs, goes back to work.

INT. MALL - LATE NIGHT

It is closed and only a few janitors remain. Stacy
and Linda walk through the large empty mall.

               STACY 
     He gave me his card. 
          (lovingly)
     'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'

               LINDA 
          (amused)
     Should we buy a frame for that?

               STACY 
     Come on, Linda, I haven't had a
     boyfriend all summer. You promised
     when I started working at the mall
     that my life would change... Do you
     think he'll call this week?

               LINDA 
     Listen, Stace, you want to know
     about guys? I'll tell you. They're
     mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I
     chased after every guy I thought
     was cute. I thought if I gave out a
     vibe they'd get the message and
     call me up. Well, guess what? They
     don't call.

               STACY 
     So what did you do?

               LINDA 
     I called them. If I was sitting
     next to a guy and I wanted to sit
     closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted
     to kiss him, I'd just do it. You
     want Ron Johnson? Grab him.

               STACY 
     I can't do that.

They pass a janitor cleaning graffiti that says:
LINCOLN SURF NAZIS and MAGGOT LUST FOR THE DUST.

               LINDA 
     Face it. With some guys you have to
     make the first move. A lot of guys
     are just... wussies.

               STACY 
     Really?

               LINDA 
     Stacy, what are you waiting for?
     You're fifteen. I did it when I was
     thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's
     just sex. If you don't, one of the
     other girls will.

               STACY 
          (cute)
     He was hot, wasn't he?

               LINDA 
     If I didn't have a fiance in
     Chicago, I'd go for it.

A young Girl runs and catches up with Linda and
Stacy.

               GIRL 
          (breathless)
     Are you Linda Barrett?

               LINDA 
     Yes.

               GIRL 
     I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us.
     Judy Hinton from May Company told
     me I could ask you something.

Linda nods.

               GIRL (CONT'D)
     I have this situation with my
     boyfriend, and I wanted to... 
          (looks at Stacy, then
          whispers in Linda's ear)

Linda listens thoughtfully, then clicks into her
"sex expert" mode.

               LINDA 
     Okay, are you over sixteen?

The Girl nods.

               LINDA (CONT'D)
     All right, what you want to do is
     go to the Free Clinic and tell the
     doctor that you have sex regularly 
     - several times a week -- and that
     you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.

               GIRL 
     And they don't call my parents?

               LINDA 
     Not if you're over sixteen.

               GIRL
     Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.

               LINDA
     And don't let them talk you into a
     diaphragm either.

The Girl thanks Linda again. Linda and Stacy get to
the back exit of the mall and Linda uses a key to
open the door.

               STACY
     I can't believe I start high school
     tomorrow.

               LINDA
     Believe it.

They exit the mall, into the night.

EXT. RIDGEMONT SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

We see all the elements of the first day of school.
The students carry new books, explore new lockers,
begin to stake out their ground.

Someone has taken the steel letters from the green
vanguard out front. It reads: "IDG MON SENOR HI
HO."

The rest of Ridgemont High is covered with toilet
paper. And a black spray paint message along the
side of the front office building reads, "LINCOLN
SURF NAZIS."

EXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOT - DAY

Brad pulls into the Ridgemont High parking lot. He
drives a beat-up, four-door model LTD sedan. Three
friends wait for him near his parking space.
They are dressed in the same golf caps with brand
logos on the front like CAT, NATIONAL and CHAINSAW.

               BUDDY #1
     Hamilton!

               BUDDY #2
     The cruising vessel! Hey -- Yooooo!

Brad climbs out of his car and pats it admiringly.

               BRAD
     Six more payments, gentlemen.

Brad joins his friends, and they walk towards the
gymnasium.

EXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOT

We see a shiny, new, blue Mustang whip into the
parking lot. Students scatter from the parking
space. Behind the wheel is football star Charles
Jefferson. A huge, black kid. The halls at
Ridgemont part for Charles Jefferson.

Rat and Damone are in the parking lot. Damone
surrounded by underclassmen (customers) selling
tickets.

               DAMONE 
     See that Mustang? U.C.L.A. gave
     Charles Jefferson that car when he
     was a sophomore.

The underclassmen are impressed. They watch as
Jefferson opens his car door and stands to his full
height, over six-foot tall. He opens his trunk and
pulls out no books, just a football duffel bag. He
slowly walks by Damone, Rat and the underclassmen.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     How ya doing! That car looks great,
     Charles!

Jefferson gives Damone a death glare.

               JEFFERSON 
     Don't... fuck... with... it.

He moves on. Damone resumes selling tickets.

               DAMONE 
     Shit, that's my man.

EXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOT

We see a clutching, smooching couple walk by.
Cheerleader Cindy Carr and her boyfriend, Gregg
Adams.

EXT. RIDGEMONT PARKING LOT - DAY

The Four Stoners (from Carl's Jr.) tumble out of a
van in the parking lot. They head towards the
gymnasium.

INT. RIDGEMONT GYMNASIUM - DAY

Standing by the A-B-C-D-E registration counter in
the gymnasium, Brad waits to pick up his red ad
card. He stands surrounded by his buddies. They nod
vigorously at everything Brad says. As he talks,
fellow students all say hello or pat him as they
pass.

One troubled-looking boy, Arnold, walks up to Brad.

               ARNOLD
     Brad, can I talk to you a minute?

               BRAD
     Arnold. What's happening?

Arnold speaks confidentially to Brad.

               ARNOLD
     Brad, I really fuckin' hate
     McDonald's, man. Ever since they
     started in with the chicken,
     everything went downhill.

               BRAD
     You want to work at Carl's?

               ARNOLD
     Oh, man, if you could swing
     something there, I'd do anything
     for you. I want to work with you
     guys.

               BRAD
     I can probably get you in there.
     Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.

               ARNOLD
     All right!!

Brad notices Stacy and nods with complete inner
cool.

               STACY
     Hi, Brad.

               BRAD
     Sis.

               BRAD'S BUDDIES
     Hey, Stacy.

               STACY
     Hi... Where's Lisa?

               BRAD
     Everyone wants to know where Lisa
     is. How should I know where Lisa
     is?
          (to buddies)
     What am I gonna do? Now my little
     sister goes to the same high
     school. The party's over.
          (to Stacy)
     So who do you have first period?

               STACY
     U.S. History. Mr. Hand.

               BRAD
     Hey-yo.

               DAVID 
     Hey-yoooooooooo.

               STACY 
          (concerned)
     What's wrong with Mr. Hand?

               BRAD 
     Nothing... if you like 'Hawaii Five
     O.' You better get in class, Stacy.
     That's not the one to be late to.

Stacy hurries off.

               RICH 
          (as soon as she is gone)
     Your sister is really turning into
     a fox.

               BRAD
     You should see her in the morning.

               BRAD'S BUDDIES
     Hey-yooooooooooo.

INT. U.S. HISTORY CLASS - DAY

Stacy barely slips in the door before the final
attendance bell sounds. She finds a seat just as
the teacher's cubicle door opens at the back of the
classroom. A tall figure comes barreling down the
aisle. He is Mr. Hand. The man makes a double-speed
step to the door at the front of the class, kicks
the door shut and locks it. The windows rattle in
their frames. Stacy watches, wide-eyed, at her
first high school class.

               MR. HAND 
     Aloha. My name is Mr. Hand.

Mr. Hand writes his name on the green chalkboard
before his class. Every letter is a small explosion
of chalk.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
          (almost sweetly)
     I have but one question for you on
     our first morning 'together.' 
          (pause)
     Can you attend my class? Pakalo?...
     Understand?... History has proven
     us one basic fact. Man does not do
     anything that is not for his own
     good. It is for your own good that
     you attend my class. And if you
     can't make it... I can make you.

An impatient knock begins at the front door of the
classroom.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     We have a twenty-question quiz
     every Friday. It will cover all the
     material we've dealt with during
     the week. There will be no make-up
     exams. It's important that you all
     have your Land of Truth and Liberty
     textbooks by Wednesday. At the
     latest.

The knock continues.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     Your grade is the average of all
     your quizzes, plus the midterm and
     final, which counts for one-third.
     Got it?

The mystery knocker tries a lazy calypso beat on
the front door. No one in Mr. Hand's U.S. History
class dares mention it, much less answer it.

Stacy grips her desk with the tension of her first
day.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     Also. There will be no eating in
     this class. You get used to doing
     your own business on your own time.
     That's one demand I make. I don't
     like staying after class with you
     on detention. That's my time. I
     don't like wasting it. Just like
     you wouldn't want me to come to
     your house some evening and discuss
     U.S. History on your time. Pakalo?

Hand finally turns, as if he has just noticed the
sound at the door and opens the door an inch.
Jeffrey Spicoli stands in the doorway, red eyes
glistening. His long, blond hair is still wet and
streaming down the back of his white peasant shirt.
He grins, oblivious to such trivial matters as
attendance bells. A Student sitting near Stacy
turns to his friends.

               STUDENT 
     That guy has been stoned since the
     third grade.

               MR. HAND 
     Yes?

               SPICOLI 
     Yeah. I'm registered for this
     class.

               MR. HAND 
     What class?

               SPICOLI 
     This is U.S. History, right? I saw
     the globe in the window.

               MR. HAND
          (appears enthralled)
     Really?

Spicoli holds his red ad card up to the crack in
the door.

               SPICOLI 
     Can I come in?

               MR. HAND 
          (swinging door open)
     Oh, please. I get so lonely when
     that third attendance bell rings
     and I don't see all my kids here.

Spicoli laughs. He is the only one.

               SPICOLI 
     Sorry I'm late. This new schedule
     is totally confusing.

Mr. Hand takes the red ad card and reads from it
with utter fascination.

               MR. HAND 
     Mr. Spicoli?

               SPICOLI 
     That's the name they gave me.

Mr. Hand slowly tears the card into little pieces
and sprinkles the pieces over his wastebasket.
Spicoli watches in disbelief. His hands are frozen
in the process of removing his backpack.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     You just ripped my card in two!

               MR. HAND 
     Yes.

               SPICOLI 
     Hey, bud. What's your problem?

Mr. Hand moves to within inches of Spicoli's face.

               MR. HAND 
     No problem at all. I think you know
     where the front office is.

It takes a moment for the words to work their way
out of Jeff Spicoli's mouth.

               SPICOLI 
     You... dick.

In the tense moment that follows, no one in the
class is sure what might happen.

Mr. Hand simply turns away from Jeff Spicoli as if
he ceased to exist and coolly continues his
lecture.

               MR. HAND 
     I've taken the time to print up a
     complete schedule of class quizzes,
     and the chapters they cover. Please
     pass them back to the desks behind
     you...

Hand begins passing out stacks of purple
mimeographed sheets.

ANGLE ON STUDENTS

all smelling the purple mimeographed sheets.

Still standing in the doorway, hyperventilating
with fifteen-year-old adrenalin, is Jeff Spicoli.
After a time, he fishes a few bits of his ad card
out of the wastebasket and huffs out of the room.

EXT. RIDGEMONT LUNCH COURT - AFTERNOON

It's packed. The school's outdoor dining area is
actually just a small courtyard lined with fast
food machines and dominated by a large oak tree in
the center. Standing at the center of lunch court,
under the large oak tree, is Brad Hamilton and his
golf-cap Buddies.

               BRAD 
     You hear about the surfer in Mr.
     Hand's class?

His Buddies shake their heads.

               BRAD (CONT'D)
     Told Hand to fuck off.

               BRAD'S BUDDIES 
     Whoa!_

Brad sees another friend pass through lunch court.

               BRAD 
     Thompson!

Brad waits for him to pass.

               BRAD (CONT'D)
     I hear Thompson got canned at Bob's
     this summer.

               BUDDY #1 
     Yeah. They hacked his hours, so he
     quit.

               BRAD 
     Where is he now?

               BUDDY #1 
     Making two eighty at Seven-Eleven.

               BRAD
     Man.
          (pause)
     They make you wear a fuckin' candy
     stripe suit over there.

               BUDDY #2 
     Poor guy.

               BRAD 
     Poor guy.

EXT. LUNCH COURT - ANGLE ON THE 200 BUILDING
BATHROOM

near the outer rim of lunch court. Jeff Spicoli
comes stumbling out into the daylight, surrounded
by a small group of Ridgemont Stoners. Marijuana
smoke billows out behind them.

               STONER BUDDY #1
     It was so bitchin', mon. Everybody
     is talking about it.

               STONER BUDDY #2
     Totally.

               SPICOLI
     The motherfucker pissed me off.

               STONER BUDDY #2
     Totally. You don't have to take
     that shit.

               SPICOLI
     I didn't take that shit.

They all laugh, flip hair out of their eyes.

               STONER BUDDY #1 
     Tell us again. What happened after
     he ripped up your ad card?

               SPICOLI 
     I called him a dick. And then I
     reached for his class notes, and I
     ripped 'em up. I said, 'Hey bud.
     Two can play this game.'

The Stoners go wild.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     I'll tell you this. If he hassles
     me again, I can't be responsible
     for what happens... you know why?

               STONER BUDDY #1 
     Because he's a fuckin' dick!

               SPICOLI 
     You got it.
          (pause)
     Gimme a dollar.

One surfer digs out a dollar for Spicoli. They look
out at lunch court, see it teeming with straight
kids. They turn and walk towards the parking lot.

EXT. LUNCH COURT - ANGLE ON STACY AND LINDA

as they walk onto lunch court. They take a seat on
the outskirts of the area and watch all the
students crowding onto the eating area.

               LINDA 
     I hear some surfer pulled a knife
     on Mr. Hand this morning.

               STACY 
     No way! He just called him a dick.

               LINDA 
     God. People exaggerate so much at
     this school.

The school couple, Cindy and Gregg walk by.

               CINDY 
     Hi, Linda. God, you look so great.

               LINDA 
     Hi, you guys. This is Stacy. Stacy,
     this is Gregg Adams and Cindy Carr.

               GREGG AND CINDY 
     Hi, Stacy.

Stacy smiles. Gregg and Cindy move on, repeating
the same scene a few feet away.

               LINDA 
     If there's one thing that never
     changes... it's a cheerleader.

Stacy turns to see a girl with short, black hair
passing by, wearing tight black spandex pants, and
dark lipstick.

               STACY 
     Linda. That girl looks just like
     Pat Benatar.

               LINDA 
     I know.

They watch her pass.

               LINDA (CONT'D)
     Actually, there are three girls at
     Ridgemont who have cultivated the
     Pat Benatar look.

Linda gestures out on lunch court.

ANGLE ON ANOTHER PAT BENATAR LOOK-ALIKE

wearing pink spandex pants and short-cropped black
hair with dark lipstick.

ANGLE ON STILL ANOTHER PAT BENATAR LOOK-ALIKE

wearing blue spandex pants and short black hair.
She stands a good distance away from the other two.

               LINDA (CONT'D)
     None of them talk to each other.

Linda looks at them with bemusement but Stacy is
wondering.

               STACY 
     Do you think guys find that
     attractive?

               LINDA 
     Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're
     much prettier than them.

They sit and eat their lunches. Linda has her
perennial diet lunch of yogurt and raw vegetables.

               STACY 
     Yeah but they look more
     sophisticated. You'd probably think
     they'd be better in bed.

               LINDA 
     What do you mean 'better in bed.'
     You either do it or you don't.

               STACY 
     No there are variables that, like,
     I might not be good at.

               LINDA 
     What variables?

               STACY 
          (shyly)
     Like, you know, giving blow jobs.

               LINDA 
     What's the big deal?

               STACY 
     Well I never did it.

               LINDA 
     There's nothing to it.

She takes out a carrot stick and eases it down her
throat. Stacv tries one but chokes.

               LINDA (CONT'D)
     You just have to practice a little
     first. 
          (feels her throat)
     Relax these muscles. Think of your
     throat as an open tunnel.

The girls try sliding the carrot sticks down their
throats without gagging.

ANGLE ON A BOY

at the next table; sees them and points them out to
his companions.

               STACY 
     What happens... don't laugh at me,
     but when a guy has an orgasm... you
     know, like, how much comes out.

Stacy stops practicing and looks horrified. Linda
laughs.

               LINDA 
     Just kidding. About 10cc.

               STACY 
          (enlightened)
     Oh! That's where that group got its
     name from.

They continue practicing as the boys look on. Stacy
manages to get almost a whole carrot down her
throat to Linda's amazement.

The group of boys break out in applause.

Stacy looks very embarrassed.

INT. BIOLOGY LAB - DAY

The class is situated so that all students sit at
Bunson burner tables lining the room.

Pat is seated at one of the tables and Stacy takes
a seat nearby; she looks at the ledge in front of
her. It contains a pig embryo. She listens to the
conversation next to her.

               GIRL STUDENT 
     I'll tell you right now. I'm not
     going. I'll get sick or something.
     I'm not going into a room with a
     bunch of dead guys.

               ARNOLD 
     You'll go. It's part of the final.

               GIRL STUDENT 
          (a Pat Benatar)
     Have you heard what they do? I'm
     serious. Have you heard?

               BOY STUDENT 
     What?

               ARNOLD 
     The bodies are dissected, Mike, and
     Mr. Vargas pulls out parts of the
     dead body and holds them up. Okay?

               BOY STUDENT 
     You mean he reaches in and pulls
     this stuff out?

               GIRL STUDENT 
     Yes.

               BOY STUDENT 
     Like a heart?

               GIRL STUDENT 
     Hearts, lungs, guts...

Stacy strains to hear more, just as Mr. Vargas -- a
diminutive man holding a coffee mug -- enters the
class.

               MR. VARGAS 
     Good day, everyone! I just switched
     to Sanka. I'm running a little slow
     today, so have a heart.

ANGLE ON THE RAT

He is riveted on Stacy Hamilton, swooning.

                           DISSOLVE
                           TO:

INT. STACY'S ROOM - NIGHT

We see Stacy's room, a young girl's room with
posters and frilly pillows. Stacy is in bed, and
her Mother is just leaving the room.

               MOTHER
     Sleep tight, Stacy.

               STACY
     Good night, Mom.

Her Mother shuts off the light, exits. Stacy pulls
back the covers. She is fully dressed.

EXT. STACY'S WINDOW - NIGHT

We see the window to Stacy's room slide slowly
open, and watch her slip outside. She hikes down a
drainage pipe to the street.

EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

A brown MG pulls up. Stacy jumps from the shadows
and hops in. The car drives away.

INT. RON'S CAR - NIGHT

Ron sits behind the wheel, humming casually along
to the music on his car stereo.

Ron has on a light-brown leather jacket. He looks
like a contestant for "The Dating Game."

               STACY
          (a little nervous)
     Thanks for picking me up.

               RON
     No problem.

He speeds off, turning up the radio to sing along.

               RON (CONT'D)
     'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine
     Columbian.'
          (eyes Stacy)
     You look nice tonight.

               STACY
     Thanks. So do you.

               RON
     Where do you feel like going?

               STACY
     I don't know. Wherever you want.

               RON
     How about the point?

               STACY 
          (nervously)
     The point sounds fine.

               RON 
          (looks at her knowingly)
     All right, the point it is.

We see Stacy's anxious face, as the car speeds up
Ridgemont Drive, with music.

EXT. THE POINT - NIGHT

Stacy and Ron sit in the car, listening to music.
The "point" is a natural lookout spot that lovers
can "discover." It is behind the baseball field and
dugout of Ridgemont High School.

Stacy and Ron get out of the car and walk to the
baseball dugout.

INT. DUGOUT - NIGHT

They sit side-by-side. Above them, a single light
bulb shines a very private fifty watts on things.

               STACY
     That's a nice shirt.

               RON
     Thanks. Thanks a lot.

Silence. They look at each other, look away.

               RON (CONT'D)
     It's very warm out tonight.

               STACY 
     It is. It's very warm. I wonder how
     long it will last?

Ron leans over and kisses Stacy lightly on the
cheek. Stacy sits quietly for a moment, thinking,
was that the first move? Then she lunges at Ron and
kisses him square on the mouth. At first surprised,
Ron then holds her there and kisses her in return.
After a time, he breaks away.

               RON
     Are you really nineteen?

               STACY
     Yes... I am really nineteen.

They continue making out.

               RON
     I think I better take you home.

               STACY
     What about those other guys you
     live with?

               RON
     No. I mean back to your home.

But they make no moves in any direction. They
continue making out. Ron begins unbuttoning her
blouse and massaging Stacy's breasts. A moment
later, he tugs at her pants. Awkwardly, she starts
to help him. He tilts her backward onto the
concrete dugout bench. They kiss feverishly, her
hand pulling off her shoes, then her pants. Ron
goes to work.

               RON (CONT'D)
          (whispers)
     Is this your first time?

               STACY
     Yes.

STACY'S POINT OF VIEW

as she feels a man enter her for the first time, we
see the graffiti above her:
                         Surf Nazis 
                         Lincoln was here --  Sieg Heil 
                         Led Zeppelin 
                         Dan y Roberto (Disco Fags)

                           DISSOLVE
                           TO:

EXT. SCHOOL LOCKERS - DAY

Stacy is standing by her locker, twirling the
combination. She is joined by Linda Barrett.

               LINDA 
     Was it great?

               STACY 
     It was okay.

               I LINDA
     You'll always remember your first
     time.

               STACY 
     It was nice.

               LINDA 
     So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it
     serious?

               STACY 
     Come on, Linda. It's just sex.

               LINDA 
     Hey! That's my line!

They both laugh and walk down the hall.

EXT. HAMILTON HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

Stacy arrives home. The Hamilton home has that
anonymous prepackaged tract look, like many others
in this lower-middle class neighborhood.

Brad washes his car in the driveway and listens to
the car radio.

               BRAD 
     Mom says to clean up the pool.

               STACY 
     Why can't you do it?

               BRAD 
     Your friends use the pool. Your
     friends messed it up.

               STACY 
     Your friends use the pool too.

               BRAD 
     I take out the garbage.

               STACY 
     Don't strain yourself.

Stacy bristles, and heads inside the front door.

INT. HAMILTON LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

The furniture in the Hamilton living room looks
like it was gleaned for a sale at Pic 'N Save.
Through the living room, one can see a very small,
kidney-shaped pool.

Stacy checks an erasable telephone message sheet
near the refrigerator. There are two names on it:
BRAD/STACY. Brad's side is filled with messages.
Stacy's is empty.

She notices a summer bouquet floral arrangement.
Stacy reads the attached note. It reads: "Memories
of You, Ron Johnson." She quickly gathers it up and
carries it back outside. She fans the door several
times to dispel the odor.

EXT. HAMILTON DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON

               STACY 
     Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?

               BRAD 
     They're not home yet.

               STACY 
     Brad, what would you say if I asked
     you to just put these flowers in
     the trunk of the Cruising Vessel
     and get rid of them at work?

               BRAD 
     I'd say... who the hell is Ron
     Johnson?

               STACY 
     I'll explain everything later.

Brad nods, as Stacy pushes the flowers into his
arms.

INT. DAMONE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

Damone expertly fills two glasses three-quarters
full of Kahlua, then adds a few drops of milk.
Music is playing on a nearby speaker. Damone hands
The Rat a drink and checks himself out in his
mirror.

               DAMONE
     See that moustache coming in, Rat?

There is only a hint of peach fuzz, but he grooms
it anyway.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     See? You can almost press it out.

Damone turns around. His friend is preoccupied.

               THE RAT
     I am in love.

Damone takes a sip of his drink, looks at The Rat.

               DAMONE
     You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part
     pussy.

               THE RAT
     What do you mean -- wuss? This girl
     is my exact type. It's her.
     Definitely her.

               DAMONE 
          (distracted)
     It's definitely your mama.

               THE RAT
     Damone, you gotta listen to me.

Damone quits puttering around his room with the
Kahlua and milk. He grabs a chair and straddles it.

               DAMONE
     All right... where did you see her?

               THE RAT
     She's in my biology class.

               DAMONE
     Did you get her number?

               THE RAT
     No.

               DAMONE
     Did you get her name?

               THE RAT 
     No. It's too soon.

               DAMONE 
     It's never too soon! Girls decide
     how far to let you go in the first
     five minutes.

               THE RAT 
     Well, what do you want me to do? Go
     up to this strange girl in my
     biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd
     like you to take your clothes off
     and jump on me?'

               DAMONE 
          (thoughtfully)
     I would. Yeah.

               THE RAT
     Really?

               DAMONE 
     I can see it all now. This is going
     to be just like the girl you fell
     in love with at Fotomat this
     summer. You bought forty bucks of
     fuckin' film and you never even
     talked to her.

               THE RAT 
          (woeful)
     You tell me, Mike. What do I do?

               DAMONE
     Okay. Okay. 
          (sighs, but loves it)
     Here's what you do.

Damone gets up, moves to the door.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     You start from the second you walk
     into biology. Don't just walk...
     move across the room.

He saunters over to the chair.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     Don't talk to her. Let her know.
     Use your face. Use your body. Use
     everything. This is what I do. I
     just sent out the vibe and I have
     personally found that... girls do
     respond. Something happens.

               THE RAT
     Of course something happens. You
     put the vibe out to thirty million
     chicks, you know something's gonna
     happen.

               DAMONE
     That's the idea, Rat. That's The
     Attitude.

               THE RAT
     The Attitude? The Attitude dictates
     that you don't care if she comes,
     stays, lays or prays. Whatever
     happens, your toes are still
     tappin'.
     When you are the cruelest and the
     coolest... then you have The
     Attitude.

Damone knocks down the rest of his drink, and we...

                           DISSOLVE
                           TO:

INT. CARL'S JR. KITCHEN - NIGHT

We see Brad operating at full throttle in the
kitchen, and taking a moment to sneak a kiss with
his girlfriend Lisa as she goes to the front
counter to open up a cash register. She allows him
only one kiss.

               LISA 
     Were those flowers really for me,
     Brad?

               BRAD 
     Of course.

               LISA 
     How much did they cost?

               BRAD 
     Don't worry about it.

She gives him a kiss... on the cheek.

               BRAD (CONT'D)
     Let's go to the Point tonight.

She pulls away.

               LISA 
     What's there to do at the Point?

Brad shifts his weight, tries to find the right
words.

               BRAD 
     What's there to do at the Point?
     God, Lisa, we've been going
     together almost two years, and...

               LISA 
     Brad. I don't want to have to use
     sex as a tool.

               BRAD 
     Tool? Tool for what? We've been
     going together almost two years!

               LISA 
     I don't want to talk about it here,
     Brad.

Brad prepares to respond. He squints his eyes,
prepares for a truly sizzling comeback, when Dennis
Taylor, short and prematurely balding assistant
manager of Carl's Jr., comes bustling out of his
back office. He quickly surveys the situation in
the kitchen.

               TAYLOR 
     Hamilton! You have fifteen double
     cheese to box!

Lisa returns to her cashier post, leaving Brad's
last words stalled in his mouth.

EXT. HAMILTON HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

We see the Hamilton's cul-de-sac home. All the
lights are off in the house at this hour. Except
for Brad's room.

INT. BRAD'S ROOM

Brad is alone in his room. He's prone on his neatly
made bed, reading a paperback book entitled Power
With Class. On the wall of Brad's room is a large
framed photo of a Carl's Jr. hamburger.

Brad hears a muffled knock at his door.

               BRAD 
     Come on in.

Stacy walks into Brad's room.

               STACY 
     Thanks for getting rid of those
     flowers.

               BRAD 
     Don't worry about it. Who sent the
     flowers?

               STACY 
     It's just some guy I met at
     Swenson's. You don't know him.

               BRAD 
     I don't care it you tell me or not.
     I got problems of my own.

He begins pacing.

               STACY 
     Is everything okay at work?

               BRAD 
     Are you kidding? Work is great. I
     kill at work. I don't even mind Mom
     and Dad making me pay rent.

               STACY 
     You're going to break up with Lisa,
     aren't you?

               BRAD 
     I've been doing some thinking. It's
     my last school year. I'm a single,
     successful guy. I think I want my
     freedom.

               STACY 
     Why? Because she won't sleep with
     you?

               BRAD 
     Where did you hear that?

               STACY 
     I'm just guessing.

               BRAD 
     Well... it's true.

               STACY 
     Maybe you just need to give her
     some time. She's so nice, Brad.
     Everybody loves Lisa.

               BRAD
     Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody
     loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't
     have to be her boyfriend.

Suddenly, Stacy pops the question.

               STACY
     Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?

               BRAD
     Why?

               STACY
     I don't know. I was just curious.

               BRAD
     Maybe yes. Maybe no.

               STACY
     You are a virgin!

               BRAD
     I didn't say that.

               STACY
     But your face did!

They laugh. Then Brad turns serious.

               BRAD 
     Are you still a virgin?

               STACY 
     Maybe yes. Maybe no.

               BRAD 
     Don't give me that shit! I know
     you're still a virgin!

Stacy smiles and stands up. She playfully slaps her
brother on the arm and walks down the hallway to
her room. We can see there is less frill and lace
in Stacy's room. The junior high paperbacks are
gone. There are no dolls in sight. 

EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Linda and Stacy walk past rows of cars. Stacy stops
at a brown MG.

               STACY 
     There... There's his car. I know
     he's at work tonight. He hasn't
     come into Swenson's since he called
     my house. My mother told him I was
     still at high school, after I told
     him I was nineteen. I guess I
     should tell him I'm fifteen.

               LINDA
     Don't you dare, you'll never hear
     from him again.

               STACY
     Does Doug care that you're
     seventeen?

               LINDA
     Doug sees beyond that stuff to what
     the person inside is like. That's
     why I'm marrying him.

               STACY
     If he ever calls again I'll say I'm
     eighteen.

               LINDA
     Boy I am so glad to be through with
     all these games.

They enter the mall.

INT. U.S. HISTORY CLASS - MORNING

We are now several weeks into the school year. Mr.
Hand is dropping test papers on desks like they are
pieces of manure.

               MR. HAND 
     C... D... F... F... F... three
     weeks we've been talking about the
     Platt Amendment. What are you
     people? On dope? A piece of
     legislation was introduced into
     Congress by Senator John Platt. It
     was passed in 1906. This amendment
     to our Constitution has a profound
     impact upon all of our daily
     liv....

Mr. Hand stops on a dime. He is like a champion
hunting dog that has just picked up the scent. He
scans the room.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     Where is Jeff Spicoli?

There is silence in the U.S. history classroom.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     I saw him earlier today near the
     200 Building bathrooms. Is he still
     on campus?

Silence.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     Anyone?

One student sitting next to Stacy raises his hand.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     Yes, Desmond?

               DESMOND 
     I saw him by the food machines.

               MR. HAND 
     How long ago?

               DESMOND 
     Just before class, sir...

Mr. Hand snaps his fingers, Hawaii Five-O style.

               MR. HAND 
     Okay. Bring him in.

Desmond hustles out the door.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     What is this fascination with
     truancy? What is it that gets
     inside your heads?

Mr. Hand begins to pace the aisles as he speaks.
Occasionally, for emphasis, he bends down to
lecture directly into the students' faces.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     There are other teachers in this
     school who look the other way at
     truants. 
          (points to attendance clip
          on the doorway)
     It's a little game that you both
     play. They pretend they don't see
     you, you pretend you don't ditch.
     Who pays the price later? You.

Desmond returns to the room with a red-eyed Jeff
Spicoli.

               SPICOLI 
     Hey! Wait a minute! There's no
     birthday party for me here!

               MR. HAND
     Thank you, Desmond.
          (to Spicoli)
     What's the reason for your truancy?

               SPICOLI
     I couldn't make it in time.

               MR. HAND
          (in top form)
     You mean, you couldn't? Or you
     wouldn't?

               SPICOLI
     I don't know, mon. The food lines
     took forever.

               MR. HAND
     Food will be eaten on your time!
          (pause)
     Why are you continuously late for
     this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you
     shamelessly waste my time like
     this?

               SPICOLI
     I don't know.

Mr. Hand appears mesmerized. He then turns and
heads for the board. He writes in long, large
letters as he slams the chalk into the green board.
He writes: "I DON'T KNOW".

               MR. HAND 
     I like that.

He stands back and admires it. He turns randomly to
Stacy.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     Don't you like that, Miss Hamilton?

               STACY 
     Yes, sir.

               MR. HAND 
     I really like that too. 'I don't
     know'... that's nice. 'Mr. Hand,
     will I pass this class?' 'Gee, Mr.
     Spicoli, I don't know'. I like
     that.
     I think I'm going to leave your
     words on this board for all my
     classes to enjoy. Giving you full
     credit, of course, Mr. Spicoli.

We hear the blare of the dismissal bell. Stacy and
the other students get up to leave. Spicoli stays
in place. He has just figured out a truly bitchin'
comeback... and his mouth is forming the first
word, when Mr. Hand cuts him off.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     You can go now.

Hand turns back to his desk. The rest of the
students have already left. Spicoli's audience is
gone. He shrugs and lopes out the door.

INT. RIDGEMONT MALL - AFTERNOON

It's Christmas time at the Ridgemont Mall. All
three tiers are strung with neon lights, and we
hear the sound of the bell-ringing Santas.

INT. SWENSON'S - AFTERNOON

Stacy and Linda are enjoying a brief lull in the
Christmas season madness. They sit at the sundae
bar. Stacy looks forlorn, almost red-eyed, as she
makes a sundae.

               LINDA 
     You've got to get used to working
     Christmas. People are always
     screaming and yelling... then they
     get home and they're all
     Christmasy.

               STACY 
     I think Christmas brings out the
     worst in people.

               LINDA 
     I guess Ron hasn't called yet.

               STACY 
     Not since November.

Linda nods her head, always the coach.

               LINDA 
     Stacy, it doesn't look good for the
     relationship.

Stacy continues making her ice cream, slapping the
scoops onto the stainless steel dish.

               STACY 
          (sighs)
     Don't you think it meant anything
     to him. Even if I am fifteen?

               LINDA 
     Stacy. What does it matter? He's a
     stereo salesman. You want to marry
     him? You want to have kids with
     him? You want this guy to come
     home, fifty years old, and he's
     still got that little Pacific
     Stereo badge on? Come on.

ANGLE ON GREGG AND CINDY

who are seated at a back table, feeding each other.

Stacy looks at her finished sundae.

               STACY 
     I should quit this job. I'm going
     to get so fat working here...
     nobody will ever take me out.

               LINDA 
     Stacy. How many times do I have to
     tell you? You are really going to
     be beautiful... someday.

               STACY 
     Thanks a lot.

Linda punches Stacy lightly on the shoulder.

               LINDA 
     Hey -- Ron Johnson? It's his loss.

We follow Stacy, as she walks into the dining room
to serve the sundae.

INT. WHEREHOUSE RECORDS - MALL - DAY

We see a group of buzz-cut young toughs, walking in
formation, hunched over, sneering and wearing
sleeveless U.S. Army fatigue jackets. None of these
damaged-looking kids is over the age of fourteen.
They pass to reveal this legend on their backs:
LINCOLN SURF NAZIS.

Angle on Mike Damone and Mark Ratner, who are
standing by the upcoming concert list posted on the
door to Wherehouse Records. Damone sees the Surf
Nazis pass, turns to Mark Ratner, who is still
wearing his Cinema Four jacket.

               DAMONE 
     The business is changing, Rat. I'll
     tell you, these kids today... they
     don't even listen to Aerosmith.

               THE RAT 
     I hear they all dress like that at
     Lincoln now.

               DAMONE 
     There used to be three or four of
     those guys. Now we see 'em every
     time we come to the mall.

Damone is approached by a couple of young ticket
Customers.

               CUSTOMER #1 
     Got any Blue Oyster Cult tickets?

               DAMONE 
     No Cult. I ate twenty-four pairs of
     Blue Oyster Cult tickets last time
     around. I was this close to working
     at 7-11. No Cult.

Suddenly we see all ticket business stop. Damone
and his customers see someone menacingly coming
directly for them. The small crowd parts as Charles
Jefferson, football duffel bag in hand, walks up.
With him is a thick, tough, miniature version of
himself. This is Little Charles. They both stop in
front of Damone.

               JEFFERSON 
          (after long look)
     When is Earth, Wind and Fire
     coming?

               DAMONE 
          (respectfully)
     I'm really not sure. I haven't
     heard anything yet, but I'll let
     you know the second there is the
     slightest news, sir.

               JEFFERSON
     I'm taking my little brother.

               DAMONE
     Excellent. So that will be two
     tickets... All right. Fine, sir.

Jefferson and L.C. push past the customers.

               CUSTOMER #2 
     Wow. He really lives here. I
     thought he just flew in for the
     football games.

               DAMONE 
          (gaining composure)
     Shit, he's my man. He knows where
     to come for tickets.

Damone turns to The Rat.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     Well, Rat. Are you ready for the
     moment of truth?

The Rat adjusts his jacket, and nods.

               THE RAT 
     She is immune to my charms.

They walk together towards Swenson's, as The Rat
drapes his aqua-blue Cinema Four jacket around his
shoulders, like a French film director. Damone
walks a few steps, then stops Rat.

               DAMONE 
     Hey, Rat.

               THE RAT 
     Yeah?

               DAMONE 
     Ace the jacket.

The Rat considers the suggestion, gets rid of the
jacket. They continue towards Swenson's.

EXT. SWENSON'S - DAY

The Rat pulls open the door to Swenson's. He walks
toward the counter to Stacy Hamilton.

               STACY 
     Hi. May I help you?

The Rat feels the beginnings of cold panic, but
barges through nonetheless.

               THE RAT 
     Yes. I have two questions. I was
     curious...

His voice becomes a shade deeper. He begins to pull
The Attitude together.

               THE RAT (CONT'D)
     What do you do with the jackets
     people leave here?

               STACY 
          (smiling)
     We keep them.

               THE RAT 
     You keep them.

               STACY 
     We keep them, in case the people
     come back.

She reaches under the counter and pulls out a
cardboard box with some rumbled jackets and other
items.

               STACY (CONT'D)
     Here they are. You can look through
     it, if you want.

The Rat chuckles to himself, struggling with The
Attitude.

               THE RAT 
     It's cool. It would take too much
     time to go through all that stuff.
     I'll just pick up a new one.

Stacy smiles. He's obviously awkward, and she likes
it.

               STACY 
     What's your other question?

               THE RAT 
     My other question is... can-I-have
     your-phone-number-so-I-can-ask-you
     out-sometime?

To The Rat's surprise, Stacy continues smiling.

               STACY 
     Do you have a pen? This one's out
     of ink.

               THE RAT 
     Oh... yes.

He pulls one out of his jacket pocket, gives it to
her. Stacy writes her name and phone number on a
scrap of paper and gives it to him. The Rat looks
at the paper.

               THE RAT (CONT'D)
     Stacy. Nice to meet you, Stacy. My
     name is Mark Ratner.

He sticks out his hand, and they shake. We see The
Rat turn around and walk out of Swenson's.

EXT. SWENSON'S - AFTERNOON

The Rat exits with ultimate cool. He sees Damone
waiting just off to the side, talking to some
girls. The Rat nods, gives him the thumbs-up.
Damone returns the gesture. All-Attitude.

EXT. CARL'S JR. - MORNING

Carl's is happening tonight. There are lots of kids
inside. We hear charging rock music -- "Girls Got
Rhythm" by AC/DC -- coming from a radio in the back
kitchen.

INT. CARL'S JR. BATHROOM - MORNING

Inside the bathroom, Brad Hamilton applies the
Carl's scrub brush to a felt tip graffiti message
near the mirror: I EAT BIG HAIRY PUSSY. He pauses
and catches himself in the mirror. He adjusts his
hair.

               BRAD 
     (talking to mirror) 
     Lisa? I have something to tell you.
     Look, I'm a senior now.
     I'm a single, successful guy and
     I've got to be fair to myself.
     Lisa... I think I need my freedom.

Brad pauses, looks at the mirror soulfully.

               BRAD (CONT'D)
     Aw, don't do that... don't take it
     personally, okay? Please? I knew
     you'd understand, because...

The bathroom door opens -- it's Arnold, the boy who
Brad got a job.

               ARNOLD 
     Brad! I know you're on your break,
     but would you cover me on register
     three?

Brad nods, exits:

INT. CARL'S JR. COUNTER

Brad stands at the register.

We see a prominent display over Brad's head: TRY
OUR 100% GUARANTEED BREAKFAST. The last of many
harried businessmen customers gets his breakfast
order and takes his seat.

Brad is joined by Dennis Taylor, the Assistant
Manager.

               DENNIS 
     Come on. Clean that counter off
     Brad. Let's go. Play ball.

               BRAD 
     Okay, Dennis.

Brad begins polishing the counter and Dennis Taylor
returns to his office at the back of the kitchen.

Brad watches him disappear behind the door that
says: ASSISTANT MANAGER.

As soon as Dennis disappears behind the door, the
one Businessman in the place rises and returns to
the counter.

               BRAD (CONT'D)
          (nervously)
     May I help you?

The Businessman has short, curly brown hair. He
speaks in a whine.

               BUSINESSMAN 
     Yes. This is not the best breakfast
     I ever ate.

The Businessman points to the huge display over
Brad's head: TRY OUR 100% GUARANTEED BREAKFAST.

               BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
     And I want my money back.

Brad begins searching under the counter.

               BRAD 
     Well, I believe you have to fill
     out a form. There's a pad right
     around here.

               BUSINESSMAN 
     No. I want my money back right now.

               BRAD 
     Well, that's not the way it works,
     really. And you ate most of your
     food already, too...

               BUSINESSMAN 
     See that sign? It says 100% Money
     Back Guarantee. Do you know the
     meaning of the word 'guarantee'? Do
     they teach you that here? Give me
     my money back.

Brad begins looking to the restroom. "Where's
Arnold?"

               BRAD 
     I can't do that. But if you wait a
     minute...

               BUSINESSMAN 
          (as if talking to a
          kindergartner)
     Look. Just put your little hand
     back in the cash register and give
     me my $2.75 back. Okay? 
          (looks at name tag)
     Please, Brad?

               BRAD
     I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find
     the forms here.

               BUSINESSMAN
     I am so tired. I am so tired of
     dealing with morons. How hard is it
     to...

Brad looks up from under the counter. No amount of
pay will make him take that kind of insult.

               BRAD 
     Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm
     gonna kick 100% of your ass.

               BUSINESSMAN
     Manager!!

"Bam!" The door to the Assistant Manager's office
swings open, and Dennis comes hurtling out of the
back.

               DENNIS 
     Can I help you, sir? Is there a
     problem?

               BUSINESSMAN 
     You bet there's a problem! Your
     employee used profanity and
     threatened me with violence! I'm
     shocked, frankly. I've eaten here
     many times and I've always enjoyed
     the service -- until today!

Angle on bathroom door as it opens and Arnold
starts towards the register. He quickly sees the
incident with the irate Businessman and ducks back
inside the bathroom.

               BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
     All I wanted was my money back for
     this breakfast. It was a little
     undercooked. And this young man
     threatened me. Now I plan to write
     a letter! I plan to...

Dennis wheels around to Brad.

               DENNIS 
     Did you threaten this man or use
     profanity in any way?

               BRAD 
     He insulted me first. He called me
     a moron.

               DENNIS
     Did you threaten this customer or
     use profanity in any way?

               BRAD
     Yes, sir.

               DENNIS
     You're fired.

Brad looks around, expecting his friends to defend
him. Dave and Rich seem very occupied with their
work. Brad is stunned.

               DENNIS (CONT'D)
          (to Businessman)
     I'm very sorry this happened to
     you, sir.

               BUSINESSMAN 
     Thank you very much.

Then Brad unhooks his fryer's apron and throws it
on the counter. He grabs a backpack and walks out
of the place. On the way, he bangs the bathroom
door with his fist.

               BRAD 
     I hope you had a hell of a piss,
     Arnold.

                           DISSOLVE
                           TO:

INT. BRAD'S ROOM - DAY

He arrives back in his room and locks the door. He
yanks the burger picture off his wall, dumps it
into the trash. Then he takes it back out of the
trash and cracks the cardboard picture and plastic
frame in half.

DARKNESS

We are in the middle of a deep, dark void. After a
moment, a pinprick of light appears in the
distance. We head towards the light. We are being
led somewhere important.

As we draw still closer, curtains suddenly part to
reveal a wildly cheering studio audience. We hear
the voice of Merv Griffin.

               MERV GRIFFIN (O.S.) 
     Will you please give a warm welcome
     to... Jeff Spicoli!

The Merv Griffin Show band begins playing a Merv
Griffin Show version of AC/DC's "Highway to Hell".
Someone hands Jeff Spicoli a microphone. He works
the studio audience into a frenzy as he sings the
words to "Highway to Hell": Merv Griffin show
style.

               SPICOLI 
          (singing)
     'Layin' ladies!             
     Drinkin' wine!          
     You gotta dollar --
     You're a friend of mine!     
     Gettin' loose!          
     Feelin' fine!               
     You and me -- It's get down time!
     We're on the Highway to Hell!   
     The Highway to Hell!'

Spicoli finishes up with a spectular pump. The
audience goes wild as Merv Griffin greets him
warmly, and guides Spicoli to his seat. Spicoli
motions for the cheers to die down. Griffin is
obviously happy to see him. He touches Spicoli's
arm lightly.

               GRIFFIN 
     How've you been?

               SPICOLI 
     Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here.
     I feel great.

               GRIFFIN 
     I was going to say... your eyes
     look a little red.

               SPICOLI 
     I've been swimming, Merv.

The audience howls. It's a famous Spicoli line.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     Seriously, Merv, everything is
     great.
     I was thinking about picking up
     some hash this weekend, maybe going
     up to the mountains.

               GRIFFIN 
          (concerned)
     I wanted to talk a little bit about
     school, if I could...

               SPICOLI
     School.
          (sighs)
     School is no problem. All you have
     to do is go to get the grades. And
     if you know something, all you have
     to do is go about half the time.

               GRIFFIN 
     How often do you go?

               SPICOLI 
     I don't go at all.

The audience is howling again. He is Merv's
favorite guest.

               GRIFFIN 
     I hear you brought a film clip with
     you. Do you want to set it up for
     us?

               SPICOLI 
     Well, it pretty much speaks for
     itself. Peter, you want to run with
     it?

EXT. A MASSIVE WAVE - DAY

The film clip begins. It is a mammoth wave cresting
against the blue sky.

               SPICOLI (V.O.) 
     Merv, this is the action down at
     Sunset Cliffs at about six in the
     morning.

               GRIFFIN (V.O.) 
     Fascinating.

A tiny figure appears at the foot of the wave.

               GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
     Who's that?

               SPICOLI 
     That's me, Merv.

The audience gasps.

               GRIFFIN (V.O.) 
     Are you going to ride that wave?

               SPICOLI 
     Totally.

We watch as Spicoli catches the perfect wave, and
it hurtles him through a turquoise tube of water.

               GRIFFIN
     What's going through your mind
     right here, Jeff? The danger of it
     all?

               SPICOLI
     Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got
     about four good hours of surfing
     left before these little clowns
     from junior high start showing up
     with their boogie boards.

The audience is howling once again... when suddenly
we hear the loud noise of a door opening, followed
by a shrill voice. It is Spicoli's eight-year-old
brother, Curtis.

Jeff Spicoli's dream of glory evaporates.

INT. SPICOLI'S TRAILER HOME - MORNING

It is a messy trailer, part of a trailer park by
the sea. Spicoli's area is small, but he has made
it his own. The walls are covered with posters,
almost all of them naked centerfolds. It is obvious
Spicoli's parents are not welcome in his room.

               CURTIS
     Dad says you have to get up!

               SPICOLI 
     Ugh.

He groans, starts to struggle out of bed.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     Leave me alone!

               CURTIS
     Dad says you're late again, you
     butthole!

               SPICOLI 
     Leave me alone.

               CURTIS
     Dad says!

Spicoli reaches over to the floor next to his bed.
He pulls a snorkel from the mess, heaves it at the
door and his little brother. It bounces off the
wall and doesn't even hit Curtis, but the kid
starts crying anyway.

               CURTIS (CONT'D)
     Daaaaaaaad! Jeff threw a snorkel at
     me!!!!!!

Spicoli gets out of bed, groans again, and kicks
the door shut.

EXT. RIDGEMONT GYMNASIUM

celebrating the big game with rival Lincoln High
School. We see Jeff Spicoli stumble from the
direction of the parking lot. He heads into the
gym, which is already full for a mandatory
assembly.

INT. GYMNASIUM - DOORWAY - DAY

Spicoli wanders into the assembly, takes a seat on
a corner bleacher. He sits just below Brad Hamilton
and Lisa.

On podium in front of assembly, Cindy Carr and
another cheerleader, Dina Phillips, are making a
presentation before the school.

               CINDY 
     I just want to say that we are not
     'Spirit Bunnies' anymore. We always
     hated that name. It bugged the heck
     out of Dina and me...

               DINA 
     It's just such a put down.

               CINDY 
     They don't call the Chess Club
     'Checker Champs' or anything like
     that. We're going to go to
     everything this year, you guys.
     We're going to go to soccer,
     wrestling, basketball...
     everything. We know you've got a
     lot of spirit! Everybody --
     riiiiiight? And we're gonna destroy
     Lincoln next week? Riiiiiiight?

ANGLE ON THE STUDENTS OF RIDGEMONT

They don't respond.

ANGLE ON JEFF SPICOLI

who is asleep in the bleachers.

ANGLE ON BRAD AND LISA

sitting nearby. We hear them over the drone of the
assembly.

               BRAD
     Man, I don't even want to see those
     guys from Carl's again.

               LISA
     If you'd apologize I think Dennis
     would take you back.

               BRAD 
     Apologize to that wimp? No way.
     Fuck Dennis Taylor. 

They sit in silence for a moment.

               BRAD (CONT'D)
     I'm just glad we're still together,
     Lisa, because I need you this year.

               LISA 
          (sighs)
     Look, Brad, I've been trying to
     think of a way to tell you this.
     We're almost out of high school,
     this is our last year. I think we
     owe it to ourselves to be free, and
     meet some new people. Then, if we
     get back together, we'll know it's
     the right thing.

TIGHT ANGLE ON BRAD'S FACE

as he accepts the news.

               LISA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
     But I still want to be friends.

TIGHT ANGLE ON BRAD'S FACE

as it falls slack.

INT. GYM - PODIUM IN FRONT OF ASSEMBLY

               CINDY 
     We're going to be going to every
     game this year. We just want the
     crowd to participate and we want
     spirit from every little person in
     this entire school. Allll-Riiiight?

There is unenthusiastic, minor applause from the
assembled students of Ridgemont High. Vice
Principal Ray Connors, a tough-looking man with an
H.R. Haldeman crew cut, approaches the podium. He
has a sour look on his face.

               CONNORS 
     Well, thank you, girls. People,
     don't forget, the big game is one
     week away. We'll see everybody back
     here on Monday and have a good
     weekend.

For the first time during this assembly, there is a
loud and hearty applause.

A GRAINY HIGH SCHOOL FILM 57

We are suddenly watching a movie shown on a class
projection screen. We see footage of a serene,
middle-class neighborhood -- as seen through the
glass windshield of a car. Judging from the other
vehicles parked on the street, the film is from the
early Sixties. We hear the narrative voice of Desi
Arnaz, speaking in his inimitable Latin accent.

               ARNAZ 
     Driving ess an important part of
     each and every one of our da-ily
     lives. Ees a responsibility like no
     o-ther and ess a matter of life
     and...

A ball comes rolling out into the serene street. A
small child runs out after it. The driving of our
vehicle brakes, but not in time. The film freeze
frames on the terrified face of a child about to be
splattered.

               ARNAZ (CONT'D)
     Death.

There is a swell of dramatic music.

               ARNAZ (CONT'D)
     They have foun'... The Braking
     Point.

The words flash on the screen and we hear a high
school Driver's Training class groan in mock
horror.

INT. DRIVER TRAINING CLASS - DAY 

ANGLE ON CHARLES JEFFERSON AND BRAD HAMILTON

who are seated in this class.

ANGLE ON LINDA AND STACY

sitting together in the class. They are oblivious,
lost in conversation.

               STACY 
     What do you think of that guy who
     works at the theatre? You know,
     Mark Ratner.

               LINDA
     Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?

               STACY 
     Sixteen.

Linda looks nauseous.

               LINDA 
     Just watch out if he pulls up in a
     van, and then puts on a Led
     Zeppelin tape.

INT. DRIVER TRAINING CLASS

The film returns to another serene street scene as
seen through another front windshield.

               ARNAZ 
     The driver here has had jus' two
     drinks. Two drinks at the home of a
     frien'.

We hear the very-present sounds of Driver's
Training students.

               STUDENT #1 
     He's fucked-up, Ricky!

               STUDENT #2 
     They guys a drunk, Ricky!

               ARNAZ
     And although this driver thinks he
     ees drivin' well, he may be 'doing
     okay, but he forgets to per-ceive
     what ees real goin' on...

In the film, another car comes barreling from the
left, running a stop sign and exploding into the
side of the two-drink goner. In the class, the
Driver's Training students are howling.

EXT. RIDGEMONT MALL - EARLY EVENING

The parking lot is full. Kids and shoppers stream
through the entrance in groups of all sizes.

INT. RIDGEMONT MALL

All three levels are teeming with kids.

ANGLE ON THE VIDEO PINBALL ARCADE

where we see Jeff Spicoli manning the Missile
Command machine. Spicoli wears a red bandana across
his forehead. A cigarette dangles from his mouth.
He is surrounded by a fleet of young surfers who
listen to him with reverence.

               SPICOLI 
     Be noble. Be aggressive. The thing
     about Missile Command is to
     decimate before you can be
     decimated. Just like in real life. 

The youngsters hang on every word of the sage
advice.

ANGLE ON A GANG OF SURF NAZIS

walking in formation.

ANGLE ON MIKE DAMONE AND MARK RATNER

walking the mall.

               DAMONE
     Check it out, Rat. The Surf
     Nazis... out for a Sunday stroll.

Damone and The Rat walk on. The Rat is barely
interested. He appears deep in thought.

               THE RAT 
     What do I say after she gets in the
     car?

Damone, obviously in his element here at the mall,
stops to flash a winning smile at a well-built
older housewife.

               DAMONE 
     No problem, Rat. What you need is
     my special Five Point Plan.

As he talks, Damone passes a Country Farms shop. He
plucks a free sample of cheese and sausage.

               THE RAT 
     Knock it off, Damone. I need real
     help.

               DAMONE 
     What do you mean? Men have died
     trying to obtain this information.
     I will give it to you for free.

The Rat and Damone continue on.

               THE RAT 
     Okay. Tell me. What's the Five
     Point Plan?

               DAMONE 
     All right. Pay attention.

The Rat nods, always the student, as they pass a
Wherehouse Record store. Damone stops right in
front of a seductively posed life-sized cardboard
stand-up of Debbie Harry, the alluring rock singer.

Damone begins his speech.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     First of all, Rat... never let on
     how much you like a girl.

Damone turns to the cardboard cutout of Debbie
Harry to demonstrate.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
          (disinterested)
     Oh. Hi.
          (turns back to The Rat) )
     Two. Always call the shots.

He turns to Debbie Harry, who looks on with an
inviting cardboard smile.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     Kiss me.
          (to The Rat)
     Three. Act like wherever you are,
     that's the place to be.
          (to Debbie Harry;
          debonair) )
     Isn't this great?
          (to The Rat)
     Four. When ordering food, find out
     what she wants and then order for
     both of you... it's a classy move.
          (to Debbie Harry; Cary
          Grant)
     And the lady will have...
          (to The Rat)
     Five. And this is most important.
     When you get down to making out,
     whenever possible, put on the first
     side of Led Zeppelin IV.
          (to Debbie Harry;
          seductive)
     Why don't you put this tape on? It
     sounds great in the back of my
     van... why don't we listen from
     there?

ANGLE ON DEBBIE HARRY

with the same inviting smile.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     And that is how you talk to a girl,
     Rat. Voila. You can't miss.

               THE RAT 
     I think I've got it. Once I get
     going, I'll be okay. But... how do
     I get started? I mean, I hardly
     know her.

               DAMONE 
     You wuss. It's no problem. One
     person says something to the other
     and that's how it starts...

Standing there in the front of the Wherehouse, The
Rat nods his head and smiles. He's finally
beginning to understand, and we...

                           CUT TO:

EXT. THE RAT'S CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

We see The Rat behind the wheel of a green Volvo.
Stacy sits beside him. They are driving the streets
of Ridgemont.

INT. THE RAT'S CAR

This is it. The Big Date. "Led Zeppelin IV" is on
the car stereo of his sister's van.

Finally...

               STACY 
     Thanks for coming to get me.

               THE RAT 
     Sure thing.

Silence.

EXT. THE RAT'S CAR

He rounds the corner of Luna Street, off the neon
fast-food stand that is Ridgemont Drive.

INT. THE RAT'S CAR

Yet another silence has fallen. Then, after a
time...

               STACY
     This is a nice car.

               THE RAT
     Yeah. It's my sister's.

Silence.

               STACY
     Do you have Mrs. George for
     English?

               THE RAT
     Yeah. She is pretty good.

               STACY
     Yeah. She is pretty good.

EXT. ATLANTIS RESTAURANT - NIGHT

They pull into the parking lot of a steak and
lobster house called The Atlantis.

               THE RAT
     Joey at Cinema Four said this is a
     pretty good restaurant.

               STACY
     I've heard that, too.

The Rat finds a parking spot near the back of the
lot, grateful that the long silence is over. He
walks with Stacy to the front of The Atlantis.

INT. THE ATLANTIS - NIGHT

The Rat and Stacy are escorted by the host to a
nearby table. They are given large wooden menus.

               THE RAT
     Do you know what you want?

               STACY
     I think I'll have the Seafood Salad
     Special.

               THE RAT 
     Excellent.

The Rat leans back in the booth. He is starting to
feel in control now. Then something hits him. The
panic sweeps across his face.

Slowly, The Rat reaches back to check his wallet.
It's gone.

               STACY 
     Are you all right?

               THE RAT 
          (weakly)
     Oh yeah.

Cool. Cool was the name of the game. Stay cool.

               THE RAT (CONT'D)
     Do you mind if I excuse myself for
     a moment?

               STACY 
     Not at all.

Just as The Rat is about to get up, the Waitress
approaches the table.

               WAITRESS 
     Are you ready to order here?

               THE RAT 
     Well... sure. 
          (settles back down)
     She will have the Seafood Salad
     Special. And I will have... the
     same.

               WAITRESS 
     Anything to drink?

               THE RAT 
     Two Cokes.

               WAITRESS 
     Okay. Thanks.

The Rat gets back up again, looking paler by the
minute. He excuses himself and walks over to the
pay phone by the Atlantis toilets.

The Rat dials a number. Damone answers.

INT. DAMONE'S ROOM - NIGHT

He is sitting in a chair, leaning onto the back two
legs, watching television.

               DAMONE 
     Yo.

               THE RAT (V.O.) 
     Damone. It's Mark.

               DAMONE 
     Mark. What happened to your date?

               THE RAT 
     It's happening right now. I'm here
     at the Atlantis. Everything's fine
     except... I left my wallet at home.

               DAMONE 
     Did you go home and get it?

               THE RAT 
     No. It's too late. The food is
     coming and everything. Damone, I've
     got to ask you this favor, and I'll
     never ask you for anything again in
     this lifetime or any other. Will
     you please borrow your mom's car,
     go by my house, get my wallet, and
     meet me back here?

There is silence.

               THE RAT (CONT'D)
     Damone, are you there?

               DAMONE 
          (world-weary sigh)
     I'm really pretty busy...

ANGLE ON DAMONE'S TELEVISION

as we see the flickering images of Leave It To
Beaver.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     You owe me for this one.

INT. ATLANTIS

The Rat hangs up, mildly relieved, and returns to
the table.

                           DISSOLVE
                           TO:

INT. STACY AND THE RAT'S TABLE - AN HOUR LATER

The Rat and Stacy have finished the meal, and
desert.

ANGLE ON THE CHECK

as it sits in a little tray before The Rat.

The Waitress approaches the table. It is clear she
wants to make room for other customers and bigger
tips.

               WAITRESS 
     Are you sure there's nothing else I
     can bring you?

               THE RAT 
     I'll have one more Coke... Do you
     want another Coke, Stacy?

               STACY 
          (quizzical) )
     Sure. I'll... have another Coke.

               THE RAT 
     Two more Cokes.

               WAITRESS 
          (sarcastic)
     Two... more... Cokes.

ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR

as Mike Damone finally walks in. Damone looks over
the diners, then feigns great surprise when he sees
The Rat.

               DAMONE 
     Hey, Mark. Is that you?

               THE RAT 
     Damone! You come here?

               DAMONE 
     I come for the seafood. It's great!
     Hey... you know what, Mark? I found
     your wallet the other day. You want
     it back?

               THE RAT 
     Wow. I've been looking for that
     thing! Hey, Damone, have you met
     Stacy Hamilton? Stacy, this is Mike
     Damone.

Stacy smiles politely, with the slightest sparkle
in her eye, as the Waitress returns with the two
Cokes.

               DAMONE
     Well, I've gotta be running.

               THE RAT
     Okay. See ya.

ANGLE ON STACY

looking strangely at the proceedings.

               DAMONE
     Nice to meet you, Stacy.

               STACY
     Nice to meet you.

Damone leaves. The Rat takes a few quick gulps of
Coke, and gets up to pay the bill. As he moves out
of camera range, we see the strange look on the
faces of waitresses and diners.

INT. THE RAT'S CAR - LATE EVENING

The Rat pulls up to Stacy's house in the cul-de
sac. He stares straight ahead, like a zombie.

               THE RAT
     I had a really nice time tonight.

               STACY
     Me, too. I'm real sorry someone
     broke in and stole your tape deck.

The Rat nods glumly.

               THE RAT
     I never thought it would happen at
     The Atlantis. Jeez.

               STACY
     Do you want to come inside?

               THE RAT
     Aren't your parents asleep?

               STACY
     No, they're away for the weekend.
     Brad and I are watching the house.

               THE RAT
     Okay. Sure. I'll come in.

We see a confused but interested look on The Rat's
face.

INT. THE HAMILTON HOUSE - EVENING

They walk in the front door. The Rat stands
uncomfortably in the doorway to the living room.

               THE RAT
     Where's your brother?

               STACY
     I don't know. Probably out. Want
     something to drink?

               THE RAT
     No. That's okay.

               STACY
     Well, I'm going to change real
     quick. I hope you don't mind.

               THE RAT
     Naw. I don't mind.

Stacy turns her back and pulls up her hair.

               STACY
     Will you unzip me?

ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE

as the wheels inside his mind start to spin. This
can't be what it seems. He unzips Stacy, past her
bra, down to the small of her back. It's the first
time he's ever done anything like that.

               STACY (CONT'D)
     Thanks!

She walks down the hall to her room, easing out of
her dress as she walks. She leaves the door to her
room open.

               STACY (CONT'D)
     You can come in, if you want!

ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE

He is completely unsure of himself, as he begins to
walk down the hall. His heart pounds into his
throat. He turns the corner and steps into Stacy's
room.

INT. STACY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Stacy stands there, looking gorgeous in an almost
seethrough white robe. The Rat pretends not to
notice.

               THE RAT 
     So... pretty nice house you've got
     here.

               STACY 
     Thanks. So... 
          (puts hands on hips)
     What do you want to do?

ANGLE ON THE RAT'S FACE

as he struggles with the memory of Damone's words.
"Always call the shots."

               THE RAT 
     I don't know.

               STACY 
     Do you want to see some pictures? I
     kept a lot of scrapbooks and
     pictures and stuff from junior
     high. How stupid, right?

               THE RAT 
     Sure.

Stacy goes to her closet, reaches up to grab the
books from the top shelf. The Rat watches her robe
slip up her legs. Then she sits down next to him.
Her knee grazes his. It is almost too much for The
Rat. Go for it. We see The Rat struggle with the
action of putting his arm around her. He almost
does, but then reacts as she says suddenly...

               STACY 
     This is me in the eighth grade. Did
     you have Mr. Deegan?

               THE RAT 
          (looking pained)
     Oh, yeah. I had Mr. Deegan.

Her knee grazes him again. Does she expect
something?

               THE RAT (CONT'D)
     Look, Stacy, I want you to know
     that...

The Rat struggles. Try as he might, he can't seem
to cross the line. He can't make his move. He is
woeful as he completes the sentence.

               THE RAT (CONT'D)
     ... I've got to go home.

               STACY
     Do you really have to go?

               THE RAT
     Well... it's getting kind of late.

Suddenly, The Rat is seized with ambition. He
reaches one hand around her right shoulder and
plants the other hand directly on her left breast.
It looks something like a wrestling hold. The Rat
looks at Stacy. Stacy looks back at The Rat. The
Rat is absolutely frozen.

               STACY
     I guess it is getting late, Mark.

She shrugs him off, walks him to the door.

EXT. THE HAMILTON HOME - NIGHT

We see The Rat's forlorn face as he trudges towards
his car. He stops. He takes a breath -- it wasn't
that late, he really didn't want to leave. The Rat
turns and begins walking back up the Hamilton
steps. Just as he does so, Stacy's bedroom light
clicks off. It was too late. He kicks at his car.

               THE RAT
     You blew it, asshole.

Behind him, recklessly speeding towards Ridgemont
Drive, is Charles Jefferson's blue Mustang.

EXT./INT. THE BLUE MUSTANG - NIGHT

Jeff Spicoli is behind the wheel. Sitting next to
him is Little Charles, "L.C.", Jefferson's younger
brother. They're smoking grass and holding
Lowenbrau beers in between their legs. The radio is
blasting the music of Rick James.

               L.C.
     Hey, slow down. This is my
     brother's car.

               SPICOLI
     I thought he was out of town.

               L.C.
     He is.

               SPICOLI
     Then don't hassle it.

They speed off down Ridgemont.

               L.C.
     Seen the new Playboy?

               SPICOLI
     Naw. Any good?

               L.C.
     Suzanne Somers' tits.

               SPICOLI
     All right.

               L.C.
     I like sex.

Spicoli sees something in the rearview mirror.

               SPICOLI
     Hold your beer down, L.C., I think
     it's a cop.

Spicoli slows down. The car behind him slows down.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     This is a cop. He's definitely
     cruising me at busting distance.

The high beams switch on behind Spicoli.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     What the fuck is this guy doing?

The car behind Spicoli then advances to the point
where it is now almost touching the blue Mustang.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     What the fuck is this guy doing?

               L.C.
     This ain't no cop.

The mystery car bumps them lightly from behind.

               L.C. (CONT'D)
     Hey! He's gonna scratch my
     brother's car!

The two boys start yelling. High beams fill the
Mustang with bright light and...

EXT./INT. MUSTANG AND GRANADA

Then mystery car pulls back, then up alongside
Spicoli and L.C. on the left. We hear the music on
the radio of George Thoroughgood's "Ride On,
Josephine".

               SPICOLI
     It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!

               L.C.
     They're fuckin' with us.

The drivers of the two cars eye each others. Then
the Granada begins inching over, trying to force
Spicoli off the road.

               L.C. (CONT'D)
     My brother's car!

               SPICOLI
     All right. Die, Granada Jocks!

Spicoli guns ahead, in a real bullet move, and
easily overtakes the Granada. Spicoli is proud of
himself. He checks himself out in the rearview and
turns to L.C.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     Would you roll your window up,
     L.C.? It's messing my hair.

Spicoli pulls way ahead of the Granada, while L.C.
rolls his window up. Spicoli looks over to L.C. and
smiles wickedly.

Now Spicoli wants to show off. He pushes the pedal
to the floor.

               L.C.
     We just missed the turnoff to the
     party.

               SPICOLI
     You know the thing I love about
     Mustangs? The steering wheel.

Spicoli fingers the bubbles in the wheel.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     With a genuine Mustang steering
     wheel, you can negotiate a hairpin
     turn with ease, my man.

EXT./INT. MUSTANG

on the word "ease", Spicoli curls his finger into
one of the Mustang steering wheel bubbles and whips
it clockwise. The idea is to turn off onto a side
street and head back to the party. But instead, at
the moment of the hairpin turn, L.C. is attempting
to switch the radio station. Spicoli crooks his
finger farther into the bubble than he expected.
The car swings in a complete circle, a circle that
includes a bright yellow fire hydrant. The hydrant
rips the side of the car open like a can of tuna.
There is a silent moment of terror.

               SPICOLI 
     Are you okay?

There is silence. Outside the smashed car, the
Granada Jocks pass Spicoli and L.C.

               GRANADA JOCKS 
     Fuck youuuuuuuuuu!

Then L.C. stirs and utters his first words.

               L.C. 
     My brother is going to kill us.
     He's gonna kill you and then he's
     gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.

               SPICOLI 
     Just be glad you're all right.

               L.C. 
     My brother is gonna shit.

               SPICOLI 
     Make up your mind. Is he gonna
     shit, or is he gonna kill us? 

               L.C. 
     First he's gonna shit. And then
     he's gonna kill us..

               SPICOLI 
     Will you just relax, mon? He's not
     gonna kill us. My father is a
     television repairman. He's got all
     kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.

               L.C. 
     You can't fix this car, Spicoli.

ANGLE ON THE BLUE MUSTANG

waffled and mangled. It is just inches away from
scrap iron.

               SPICOLI 
     I can fix it.

MONTAGE OF SHOTS

as we see Ridgemont High gearing up for its big
Homecoming Game against Lincoln. We see a series of
shots of kids talking about it, wagering on the
chances of a Ridgemont victory. We see the many
signs and placards all over school, proclaiming
Ridgemont revenge. We see students lining up to
vote for Homecoming King and Queen in the
gymnasium. It is the most spirit that Ridgemont has
shown this year.

                           DISSOLVE
                           TO:

EXT. RIDGEMONT SCHOOL - FLAGPOLE - DAY

From the back of the parking lot, we see a crowd
around the flagpole. A group of kids are staring at
something. They sadly shake their heads at the
sight, as if they are witnessing a funeral.

As we draw closer, we see the center of commotion.
It is an ugly sight. Someone had wrecked Charles
Jefferson's Blue Scholarship Mustang and welded it
to the flagpole. Spray-painted on the side was the
message: LINCOLN SURF PUNKS RULE.

EXT. RIDGEMONT BLEACHERS - NIGHT

The Ridgemont football bleachers are full of
cheering students. We see the same basic groups
from lunch court, and many more.

The cheerleaders are on the field -- Cindy Carr,
Dina Phillips and company -- and their cheerleader
"husbands" sit directly in front of them in the
stands. Linda and Stacy sit in the bleachers with
some of the Swenson's girls. The Rat and Damone sit
several rows above them, watching. The teachers sit
together in another section.

ANGLE ON BRAD HAMILTON

who is again sitting alone in the bleachers.
Watching. Several old lunch court friends pass by,
on their way to the concession area.

               STUDENT #1
     Hey, Brad! How's going?

               BRAD
     All right.

               STUDENT #2
     Where you working?

               BRAD
     Fish and chips place.

               STUDENT #1
     Which one?

               BRAD
     Just a fish and chips place.

Brad says nothing more. The students look at each
other.

               STUDENTS 
     We'll be seeing you, Brad!

               BRAD 
          (sullen)
     Later.

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - THE GAME - NIGHT

Everyone is cheering the amazing game on the field.
Charles Jefferson is poised on the offensive line.
He mutters a string of obscenities at the opposing
Lincoln player. The ball is snapped, and Charles
Jefferson comes directly at the player with both
elbows up and angled to hit inside his helmet. The
Lincoln player is hit and keels over.

Charles Jefferson sets up for another play. The
ball is snapped. Ka-boom. Down falls another
Lincoln player. Jefferson doesn't know who it was
who wrecked his Mustang, but he wasn't about to
spare any of them. There is pure madness in his
eyes. It has taken him over.

The Ridgemont points rack up. Jefferson is single
handedly maiming Lincoln for Homecoming.

EXT. RIDGEMONT BLEACHERS - NIGHT

We see Jeff Spicoli and L.C. sitting calmly in the
bleachers, watching.

               SPICOLI 
     I think we may have gotten away
     clean.

EXT. FIELD AND SCOREBOARD

The half-time gun fires and the score is 36-7...
Ridgemont. Even the Ridgemont players steer clear
of Charles Jefferson as they return to their locker
room.

EXT. THE HAMILTON POOL - HOT AFTERNOON - SEVERAL
WEEKS LATER

Linda and Stacy are sitting by the pool, dressed in
string tie bathing suits. They are listening to the
music of Tom Petty's "Breakdown" playing on the
living room stereo. Linda luxuriously applies
suntan lotion to her chest and legs, in long and
writhing strokes. Stacy reads a book. It's called
Total Orgasm. Several beats pass.

               LINDA 
     I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll
     be so glad when he gets out here.

               STACY 
          (engrossed in book)
     You really ought to look at this,
     Linda. There's a drawing on every
     page... and all these quizzes. It's
     like school.

               LINDA 
     Why don't you put your mother's
     secret book back?

Linda continues regally applying lotion.

               STACY 
     Listen to this... 'What are your
     mate's three most erogenous zones?'

               LINDA 
          (automatic)
     Okay, penis, that's one, balls...

               STACY 
     Wouldn't penis and balls be the
     same category?

               LINDA 
     You're right. Probably penis, mouth
     and neck.

               STACY 
     All right! Here's another one. 'The
     most satisfactory lovemaking occurs
     when your mate climaxes first, you
     climax first, you and your mate
     climax together?'

               LINDA 
     Climax together.

               STACY 
     Does that ever happen?

               LINDA 
     No. But it's a nice idea.

               STACY 
     Listen to this ... it says 'Most
     women derive pleasure from sex, but
     they don't have real orgasms.'

Linda stops applying lotion, considers that
thought.

               LINDA 
     Well... they obviously don't know
     about Doug.

They laugh. Linda resumes applying the lotion.
Stacy continues reading the book. A couple of beats
pass.

               STACY 
     How long does Doug take?

               LINDA 
     I don't know. Thirty to forty
     minutes.

               STACY 
          (pause)
     What's Doug do in Chicago?

               LINDA 
     He works for the airline. He'll be
     out here. You'll meet him.

Stacy looks at Linda, almost disbelieving.

               LINDA (CONT'D)
          (wistful)
     He's no high school boy.

There is a noise by the side fence leading into the
Hamiltons' backyard. It is Mark Ratner and Mike
Damone. They are already wearing swimsuits.

               DAMONE 
     Hey! We came over to help you with
     Math homework!

               STACY 
     Oh, really?

               THE RAT 
     Really. We figured you needed the
     help. On such a hot day.

Stacy quickly stashes the book in a stack of towels
beside her. She leans over to Linda and speaks
confidentially.

               STACY 
     What do you think?

               LINDA
     I think they're both virgins.

Stacy smiles, gets up and goes over to the fence.

               STACY
     I didn't ask for any help. Did you,
     Linda?

               LINDA
     No.

               DAMONE
     Well, that's exactly why I brought
     some Wisk for the jacuzzi.

               STACY
     O-kay, you guys can come swimming.
     But you have to leave as soon as my
     Mom gets home. Okay?

EXT. HAMILTON POOL

Mike Damone yells "banzai!" and dives into the
small pool. At one end of the pool is the jacuzzi,
which is separated by a tile wall. Damone has
already poured the Wisk into the jacuzzi, and the
detergent has created a huge bubble bath effect.
Damone surfaces and flips into the jacuzzi.

Stacy, looking great in a green bikini, sits
kicking her legs by the side of the pool. Linda
stands on the board. She is poised to dive. The Rat
treads water and stares at both girls. Inside the
Hamilton living room, the family stereo plays the
music of Deep Purple's "Woman From Tokyo".

               DAMONE 
     Hey, Linda! I'll judge your dive.
     I'm a champion diver myself.

Brad arrives home by the side gate and slams it
behind him. He is home from a bad day at work. He
walks out onto the patio and stands with his hands
on his hips. For the first time, our former campus
hero looks absurd. He is still in his uniform from
Captain Kidd Fish and Chips -- it is a blue and
white striped Pirates of the Caribbean outfit,
complete with black plastic sword at the side, and
a ridiculously large Ponce de Leon-esque hat. Brad
carries the hat under his arm.

               BRAD 
     Does Mom know you have company?

               STACY 
     It's just Linda. And Mark from
     school.

Brad ignores the underclassmen, and notices Linda
on the board in her maroon bikini. He smiles.

               BRAD 
     Hi, Linda.

               LINDA 
     Hi, Brad.

               BRAD 
     Well, you guys, keep it down. I've
     got some work to do upstairs.

Brad turns and heads back inside. He is just out of
earshot when they begin talking about him.

               LINDA 
     God, he hardly even talks anymore.

               STACY 
     I know. He hates to have to wear
     uniforms.

               DAMONE 
     Poor guy.

               THE RAT 
     Really.

Stacy breaks the spell by jumping into the water,
surfacing, and flipping over the tile wall into the
Jacuzzi. She sits next to Damone, looking
mischievous.

ANGLE ON DAMONE AND STACY IN THE JACUZZI

talking while the others are at the other end of
the pool.

ANGLE ON THE RAT

casually catching sight of them together from the
other side of the pool. We can read the emotions on
The Rat's face. He is still taken with Stacy, but
his big moment for her appears to have passed.

ANGLE ON DAMONE AND STACY IN THE JACUZZI

as they talk.

Underneath the water, her leg accidentally knocks
against his. Then he feels her continue. Damone
feels Stacy's cool hand on his inner thigh. Moving
upwards, stopping just short of the bulge in his
trunks.

ANGLE ON DAMONE'S FACE

as it loosens and quivers just the slightest bit.
This is uncharted territory, even for Mr. Attitude.

ANGLE ON LINDA

who is now sunning herself by the side of the pool.
She rubs her legs against each other, slowly,
enjoying the hot afternoon.

EXT. BRAD'S WINDOW - ANGLE ON BRAD

who is watching Linda from the window in his room.
We see him from behind, peeking out the curtains.

EXT. POOL - ANGLE ON LINDA

who smiles at Damone and flips back into the pool
with a splash. Damone steals a look down at his
swimsuit. He's popped a big one.

               THE RAT 
     Why don't you get up and do a dive,
     Mike?

               LINDA 
     Go ahead.

ANGLE ON DAMONE'S FACE

and we know he can't get out of the water yet.

               DAMONE
     No. I don't think so. Not right 
     now.

               THE RAT
     Chicken!

Linda, for one, loses interest quickly. Standing by
the side of the pool, she jams a finger in her ear
and wiggles it.

               LINDA 
     Stacy! I've got water in my ears.
     Do you have any Q-Tips?

               STACY 
     God, I don't think so. Better look
     in the house.

Linda towels off and heads back inside the Hamilton
house. She knows how to walk.

INT. BRAD'S BEDROOM AND BATHROOM - AFTERNOON

We see Brad's room. The Carl's burger picture on
the wall is conspicuously missing. There is music
playing from his stereo -- Pink Floyd's "You and
Me".

We see Brad. He is kneeling on the bathroom floor,
his back to us. His green T-shirt is on, his
underwear in a pile on the floor behind him. His
arm is pumping slowly. Brad is jacking off.

                           DISSOLVE
                           TO:

EXT. HAMILTON POOL - BRAD'S DAYDREAM

It features Linda Barrett, just as she stood on the
diving board a moment ago. She is gorgeous. Her
breasts seem even bigger than usual. Her nipples
are hard, poking through the film maroon string
bikini. Water rolls slowly down her cheeks, into
the corners of her mouth. Her lips are parted
slightly. Her eyes are filled with desire as she
says...

               LINDA 
     Hi, Brad.
          (pause)
     You know how cute I always thought
     you were. I think you're so sexy.
     Will you come to me?

ANGLE ON BRAD IN DAYDREAM

in a nice shirt, his hair combed back and looking
great. He walks to Linda. She reaches out and grabs
him for a kiss, pulling him close. Then she pushes
him away, so he can watch as she carefully unstraps
the top of her bathing suit. The incredible Linda
Barrett's breasts fall loose.

She takes Brad's hands and places them on her, as
she begins unbuttoning his shirt. They are just
about to fall into passionate lovemaking when we
hear...

               LINDA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
     Hey, Brad! Do you have any Q-Ti...

The daydream evaporates and we see real life again

in the doorway of Brad's bathroom as she watches
the sight before her.

ANGLE ON BRAD

trying to cover himself and act nonchalant and keep
his back turned at the same time. The words barely
escape his mouth.

               BRAD 
     Wait just a... minute.

               LINDA 
     Sorry. I didn't know anybody was in
     here.

Linda turns and goes immediately, as if she wants
to forget what she saw as quickly as possible. She
closes the door behind her.

ANGLE ON BRAD

still kneeling. It had all happened so quickly, so
fast

               BRAD
     Doesn't anybody fuckin' knock
     anymore?

He slams the toilet seat down and we...

                           CUT TO:

INT. U.S. HISTORY CLASS - DAY

The third attendance bell rings, and Mr. Hand
strides to the front of the class. He locks the
door. Then he takes the front of the class and
notices something very different.

ANGLE ON JEFF SPICOLI

bright and clear-eyed, sitting in the front row.
His hands are clasped in front of him on the desk.
His textbook is open to the proper page.

Mr. Hand is suspicious, but continues with class.

               MR. HAND 
     Now in 1898, Spain owned Cuba.
     Outright. Think about it. Cuba,
     owned by a disorganized parliament
     4,000 miles away. Cubans were in a
     constant state of revolt.

Mr. Hand begins pacing the aisles as he talks.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     In 1904, the United States decided
     to throw a little weight around,
     and...

There is a brief, sharp knock at the door. Mr. Hand
whips his head around, like McGarrett. He
approaches the door like a cat.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
          (sweet voice)
     Who is it?

               VOICE
     Mr. Pizza.

               MR. HAND 
     Again?

               VOICE
     Mr. Pizza, sir!

Hand swings the door open, out of curiosity. In
walks a young Man in a Mr. Pizza delivery shirt.

               PIZZA MAN 
     Okay, who had the double cheese
     sausage and bologna?

Jeff Spicoli speaks up.

               SPICOLI 
     That's me.

The Delivery Man takes the pizza, sets it on the
desk, as Spicoli whips out some crumpled dollars.
Then he produces yet another crumpled dollar, and
presses it into the Delivery Man's hand.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     For you, my man.

The Delivery Man thanks him warmly, just as Mr.
Hand rages into the picture.

               MR. HAND
     Am I hallucinating here? Just what
     in the hell do you think you're
     doing?

               SPICOLI
     Learning about Cuba. Having some
     food.

               MR. HAND
     Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous
     ground here. You're causing a major
     disturbance in my class and on my
     time.

               SPICOLI
          (cool and urbane)
     I've been thinking about this, Mr.
     Hand. If I'm here... and you're
     here... doesn't that make it our
     time?

Mr. Hand is so furious he's almost shaking.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     So I thought I'd order us a pizza.
     Just leave me a lot of bologna...

Mr. Hand snatches up the pizza, and starts to throw
it in the wastebasket. Then he thinks better, and
heads for the door. He opens it just as a gang of
young Stoners walk past.

               STONER #1 
     There's the pizza.

               STONER #2 
     Totally!

Mr. Hand pushes the pizza into their hands and
slams the door.

               SPICOLI 
     You better save some for me, you
     swine!

               MR. HAND 
     And you, my friend. I'll see you
     for a two-hour detention every
     afternoon this week.

Spicoli eases back in his chair, shrugs. It was a
good idea at the time.

INT. CAPTAIN KIDD FISH AND CHIPS - DAY 

Brad Hamilton, looks terribly uncomfortable in his
Ponce de Leon hat and buccaneer uniform. He rings
up an order for an older Customer.

               CUSTOMER 
     Why aren't you in school, son?

               BRAD 
     I go to school in the mornings. I
     have a work study program for the
     afternoon.

He bags one final coffee and punches up the amount.

               BRAD 
     $8.46, please.

               CUSTOMER 
     Here you go. I have it exactly. 
          (sets money down)
     Good luck!

               BRAD 
     Thank you, and thanks for coming to
     Captain Kidd.

Brad loosens his buccaneer scarf, and starts back
towards the kitchen. He is stopped by the sudden
appearance of Captain Kidd Assistant Manager,
Harold.

               HAROLD 
     Hamilton! I'll take over the fryer.
     Those boys at IBM need some Catch
     of-the-Day boxes, and I told them
     you would personally deliver them
     within the hour. I'll reimburse you
     for gas.

Brad dutifully unhooks his apron, to reveal the
bottom half of his pirate suit.

               BRAD 
     Just write me out a bill.

While Harold leans down to tally up the fish order,
Brad goes to a nearby employee's closet. He has
completely perfected the art of changing back into
his street clothes, and it takes less than a
minute. He is just about to finish buttoning his
street shirt when Harold sees him.

               HAROLD 
     Hamilton, come over here. What is
     that you've got on?

               BRAD 
     This is how I dress all the time.

               HAROLD 
     But you took off your Captain Kidd
     uniform.

               BRAD 
     I thought I'd take it off for the
     drive over to IBM. It's kind of
     uncomfortable.

Harold can barely fathom the idea.

               HAROLD 
     Come on, Hamilton. You're going
     over there to represent Captain
     Kidd Fish and Chips. We have stores
     all over Southern California. Part
     of our image, part of our appeal is
     in our uniforms. You know that!

               BRAD 
     You really want me to put all this
     stuff back on?

               HAROLD 
     Yes. I think so. Show some pride,
     Hamilton.

ANGLE ON BRAD

as he stands there, stoic looking.

               BRAD 
     I don't believe you're asking me to
     do this, but okay.

He begins taking off his street shirt. He looks at
Harold, looks at the boxes, and returns to the
closet.

INT. THE CRUISING VESSEL

Brad is driving down the freeway, listening to the
music of Bruce Springsteen's "Out in the Streets."
He pries open one of the fourteen Catch-of-the-Day
boxes on the seat next to him and pulls out a small
piece of fried fish. Brad takes a bite.
The look on his face says it is the worst piece of
shit he has ever tasted. He throws the piece out
the window, and drives on.

Brad turns to see a girl smiling at him from
another car. It makes his afternoon. He returns the
smile with gusto.

ANGLE ON THE GIRL

as she bursts out laughing and drives away.

ANGLE ON BRAD

looking perplexed. Then he realizes that he hasn't
taken his Ponce de Leon hat off. Brad drives on.

A SERIES OF ANGLES ON BRAD'S CAR

as we see the Cruising Vessel move down the
highway. We see the Captain Kidd hat go flying out
the window. Then the plastic sword, and the scarf.
Then a couple boxes of Captain Kidd fish. Then the
rest of them. We see Brad rip past the IBM
Building.

                           DISSOLVE
                           TO:

EXT. RIDGEMONT HIGH SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

School is out and kids are leaving campus, heading
for the parking lot and bus stop. We see Mike
Damone carrying some books, walking towards
Ridgemont Drive. He is joined by Stacy Hamilton,
who hurries to catch up to him.

               STACY 
     I can't wait until I can drive next
     year. I walk every day. It's such a
     drag.

               DAMONE 
     Get a ride with somebody.

               STACY 
     Sometimes I get a ride with my
     brother. But he usually works in
     the mornings, and then drives to
     school himself.

               DAMONE 
     What a guy. 

Damone turns to her after a moment, all Attitude.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     You know Mark Ratner really likes
     you. You like him?

               STACY
     Mark is a really nice boy...

Stacy walks along, then stops and looks at Damone.

               STACY (CONT'D)
     But I think I like you.

They turn the corner.

EXT. HAMILTON HOME

They have arrived at Stacy's house. There are no
cars parked out front. No one is home.

               STACY
     Do you want to come in for a
     second?

The Attitude starts to weaken. After a long pause,
Damone responds.

               DAMONE
     Do you have any ice tea?

               STACY
     Sure. Come on in.

Stacy unlocks her front door, they go inside.

INT. HAMILTON KITCHEN

Damone stands in the white linoleum Hamilton
kitchen. Stacy opens the refrigerator door.

               STACY
     I guess the annuals are coming in
     pretty soon. Are you going to get
     one?

               DAMONE
     I don't know.

               STACY
     Aren't you curious to see how your
     class picture turned out?

               DAMONE
     I know what I look like.

Stacy places a glass of ice tea in front of him.
They are all alone in the house.

               STACY
     Do you want to take a quick swim?

               DAMONE
     Well...

               STACY
     Brad probably has some trunks you
     can borrow... I'm going to my room
     to change!

Damone stares straight ahead. She's going to her
room to change. Stacy scoots down the hall toward
her bedroom.

               DAMONE 
     This is great ice tea!

INT. STACY'S ROOM - ANGLE ON STACY IN HER ROOM

In the middle of changing, she has caught her own
reflection in the mirror. She pauses a moment,
looking at the young girl looking back.

INT. KITCHEN - ANGLE ON DAMONE IN THE KITCHEN

He continues staring straight ahead.

               STACY 
          (from other room)
     You don't have to shout! You can
     come back here to my room!

Damone doesn't move. He pretends he doesn't hear. A
moment later, Stacy comes bounding back down the
hall in her green bikini. She grabs Damone by the
arm.

               STACY 
     Come with me! I know there's a suit
     in the changing room!

She pulls him away.

INT. THE CHANGING ROOM

They enter the wood-panelled changing room next to
the Hamilton pool. There are two swimsuits hanging
from wooden pegs.

               STACY 
     Pick a suit.

               DAMONE 
     I don't know. It's getting pretty
     late...

She locks the door to the changing room and begins
to walk towards Mike Damone.

               STACY
     Are you really a virgin?

               DAMONE
     Come on...

He could feel his leg starting to shake the
slightest bit.

               STACY 
     It's okay if it's your first time.

She gives him a kiss.

               DAMONE
     Listen. I feel pretty strange here.
     Because Mark really likes you, and
     he's my friend.

               STACY
     He's my friend, too.

She gives him another kiss. He kisses her in
return. Standing there, feeling Stacy in her
bikini, feeling her kiss him, Damone also felt some
of his reservations slip away.

               DAMONE
     You're a really good kisser.

               STACY
     So are you.
          (pause)
     Are you shaking?

               DAMONE
          (shaking)
     No. Are you crazy?

It is clear that this is as far as Mr. Attitude has
ever gotten with a girl. Stacy takes the
initiative, rubbing her hands through his hair,
rubbing his sides, kissing his neck, then pulling
away.

               STACY
          (whispers)
     Why don't you take off your
     clothes, Mike?

               DAMONE
     You first.

               STACY
     How about both of us at the same
     time?

Damone nods, and watches as Stacy unhooks her top
and steps out of her bikini bottom. She stands
naked in the shadows of the afternoon sun. She sits
down naked on a red changing room couch, and
gathers her legs up to her chest. She watches as
Damone struggles with his clothes.

ANGLE ON DAMONE

hopping on one leg, pulling first out of his pants,
then his jockey underwear. Bashfully, he goes to
sit next to Stacy on the couch. They begin to kiss,
and it quickly escalates into heavy petting. Stacy
pulls away.

               STACY
     I want you to know that it's your
     final decision if we should
     continue or not.

               DAMONE
     Let's continue.

Stacy leans back and pulls him on top of her. He
enters her and begins pumping so hard, so fast,
that he doesn't notice he's banging the sofa into
the wall of the changing room.

But just as quickly as Damone starts, he stops.

               STACY 
          (whispers)
     Hey, Mike?

               DAMONE
     What? Are you all right?

               STACY
     I think we're making a lot of
     noise.

               DAMONE
     I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

He has a strange look on his face.

               STACY
     What's wrong?

               DAMONE
     I think I came. Didn't you feel it?

               STACY
     I guess I did.

They lay there, Damone still on top of her on the
red couch.

ANGLE ON DAMONE

as we read the confusion on his face. He is
embarrassed, a little confused... mostly he just
wants to be alone.

               DAMONE 
     I've got to get home. I've really
     got to go, Stacy.

ANGLE ON STACY

as she looks up at him. She gives him a kiss.
Damone gets up puts his pants and shirt on. He
leaves the changing room.

                           DISSOLVE
                           TO:

INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - AFTERNOON

We see Stacy sitting at her usual seat, and she's
wearing a bright spring dress with a slight amount
of makeup.
She looks at Damone's seat with anticipation, but
it remains empty as other students file in.
Finally, she turns to The Rat.

               STACY 
     Where's Mike today?

               THE RAT 
     Today's April 16th. Damone never
     comes to school on April 16th.

               STACY 
     What's April 16th?

               THE RAT 
     It's John Bonham's birthday.

               STACY 
     John Bonham?

               THE RAT 
     John Bonham. The drummer for Led
     Zeppelin. He died a couple years
     ago. Every birthday he stays home
     and plays everything John Bonham
     ever recorded. It's like his own
     holiday.

               STACY 
     Oh. I see.

The bell rings, and Mr. Vargas enters the room with
his Sanka cup.

INT. COLLEGE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Seated at the desk is Mrs. O'Rourke. There is a
knock at the door.

The door swings open. Brad Hamilton holds out his
yellow slip.

               MRS. O'ROURKE 
     Have a seat, Brad... Brad have you
     got your list of college
     applications?

               BRAD 
     Well, to tell you the truth Mrs.
     O'Rourke, I've kind of been putting
     it off. I'm not sure what I want to
     do yet.

               MRS. O'ROURKE 
          (by rote)
     All right Brad. Let me ask you like
     this. If I were queen of the world,
     and I could make you whatever you
     wanted to be, what would it be?

               BRAD 
     I don't know... Burt Reynolds.

There is no humor on Mrs. O'Rourke's face.

               MRS. O'ROURKE 
     I realize it's important to have
     fun in your senior year, with your
     friends, but there comes a time
     when you have to get serious about
     your future, think about college,
     and put aside all this fun.

Brad looks up suddenly.

               BRAD 
     You know what, Mrs. O'Rourke? I
     broke up with my girlfriend this
     year. I lost my job at Carl's, and
     two other places. I wake up at 5:30
     to work at 7-11, then I go to
     school, then I go back to 7-11. I
     have to pay rent, you know. My
     grades haven't been that bad, and
     now you're telling me that the fun
     is over. Well, I'm still waiting
     for the fun to start.

               MRS. O'ROURKE 
     Brad, I'll see you when I'm through
     with the rest of the seniors. If
     you want to visit the career
     office, go right ahead. I'll talk
     to you when you're more prepared.

Brad gathers his books and opens the door to leave.

               MRS. OIROURKE
     Next!

An absolutely exuberant Cindy Carr pops her head in
the door.

               CINDY
     Hi-yeeeeeeee!!!

                           DISSOLVE
                           TO:

EXT. RIDGEMONT HALLWAY - MORNING

The bell has just rung, and Mike Damone comes out
of Youth and Law class. He has an absorbed, driven
look on his face. He walks past the rows of
lockers, and doesn't even notice as he passes Stacy
Hamilton standing by her locker. She smiles, grabs
his arm affectionately.

               STACY 
     Hi Mike!

Damone turns to see her, is thoroughly unimpressed.

               DAMONE 
     Oh. Hi.

               STACY 
     I didn't see you this morning.

               DAMONE 
     Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.

               STACY 
     I'm in a hurry too. I just thought
     I could say hi to you.

               DAMONE 
     Hello.

He pulls away, leaving a bewildered Stacy standing
by her locker. She grabs some books and hurries in
the other direction.

EXT. SCHOOL BUS - DAY

The bus pulls up to the front entrance of
University Hospital. The students file out and
collect next to the front door. Mr. Vargas
gleefully addresses the class. This is his favorite
field trip.

               MR. VARGAS
     Today we're going to explore how
     this hospital works to preserve
     human life.
     We'll be visiting every floor,
     every level where these fine
     doctors and nurses take care of us,
     in life... and in death.

INT. MATERNITY WARD

The class exits from a hospital elevator, onto
another floor. They are now standing outside the
maternity ward. We hear the loud noise of babies.

               MR. VARGAS
     Over thirty children are delivered
     here each day...

The class moves on.

INT. THE BOTTOM FLOOR

The class exits another hospital elevator.

               MR. VARGAS
     This is part of your third quarter
     exam, and I'd advise you to take
     careful notes on what we're about
     to see.

ANGLE ON DR. MILLER

a young intern who has joined the class for the
last part of their tour.

               MR. VARGAS
     May I just ask you one last time to
     conduct yourselves with the utmost
     maturity...

The kids are beginning to get very nervous now as
they are led down the hall to the "Cold Room." The
door to the "Cold Room" has only one sign on it. It
reads: CADAVERS -- MEDICAL EXAMINATION ONLY. Mr.
Vargas opens the door, and the class seems to gasp.

INT. THE COLD ROOM

There are six examination tables in the "Cold
Room". Each of them contains a cadaver covered by a
white sheet. Mr. Vargas has gathered the class
around one table in particular. He fingers the edge
of the white sheet as he talks.

               MR. VARGAS 
     As you know, all the bodies in this
     room are recently deceased human
     bio-structures.

A student raises his hand.

               MR. VARGAS 
     Yes, Randy?

               RANDY 
     Who are these guys?

               MR. VARGAS 
     Most of them were derelicts, Randy.
     They sold the right for medical
     examination of their bodies for
     money. Something like thirty
     dollars, I believe. Isn't that
     right, Doctor Miller?

               DR. MILLER 
     Twenty-five dollars.

ANGLE ON JEFF SPICOLI

who turns to Stacy.

               SPICOLI 
     Twenty-five bucks is pretty good.

               MR. VARGAS 
     Now this gentleman here is named
     Arthur. Arthur died from heart
     failure last week and we are
     fortunate enough to view his body
     in its pristine state.

Mr. Vargas suddenly pulls the white sheet aside and
we see the body of Arthur. The students' eyes
widen. Some gasp. Others cover their mouths. Others
begin furious notes. Nobody speaks. The body of
Arthur is smallish and withered. It is orange,
flaky, and not quite real looking. A deep cut has
been made in Arthur's chest.

Mr. Vargas bends Arthur upright for a better
student view. He gestures to the deep cut made in
Arthur's chest.

The tension mounts.

               MR. VARGAS (CONT'D)
     This incision allows us to pull
     aside the skin covering of the
     chest cavity and really observe the
     human organs as they exist in their
     natural state.

ANGLE ON ARTHUR

and his shrunken face, which seems to say please
don't.

               MR. VARGAS (CONT'D)
     I want all of you to take a look at
     the chest cavity for just a moment.

Mr. Vargas grabs the two sides of Arthur's chest
cavity covering, and rips it open.

               MR. VARGAS (CONT'D)
     Here we have the human lungs and
     heart, which you can see is
     actually located in the center of
     your chest.

With a squish, Mr. Vargas reaches inside Arthur and
pulls out the human heart for display. The class
stands in silent shock. Only one comment escapes
from any of them.

               SPICOLI
     Bitchin'.

ANGLE ON STACY HAMILTON

who goes running out of the "Cold Room", holding
her mouth. The Rat runs after her.

INT. BOTTOM FLOOR HALL

Rat and Stacy sit side-by-side on some orange
plastic chairs, by a nurse's desk. Stacy is shook
up.

               STACY 
     I made a fool of myself.

               THE RAT 
     Nobody noticed. Don't worry about
     it. We'll just stay out here until
     everyone comes out, we'll blend
     back in.

               STACY 
     What about the notes?

               THE RAT 
     I'll get you the notes.

She squeezes his arm.

EXT. HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON

The students file out of the hospital, looking like
they've just been through a war.

INT. LINDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It is night, and Linda and Stacy are watching
Fantasy Island.

               MONTALBAN 
     You see, Tatoo, what this man
     doesn't realize is that he must one
     day leave Fantasy Island. And he
     must continue his life as an
     incurable leper.

Stacy is fighting back tears. Linda looks angry.

Telephone rings. Linda jumps to get it.

               LINDA 
     Hello.

Linda obviously is disappointed when she hears a
female voice.

               LINDA (CONT'D)
     Yeah... you're kidding... What did
     he say... What did you say... How
     much did it cost? Look, tell him he
     can have a relationship with you or
     a 'more open' relationship with
     someone else... Listen, Debbie, can
     I call you later. I'm waiting for
     Doug to call.

She plops back on the couch with Stacy.

               LINDA (CONT'D)
     I'll bet he forgets to call again.

She notices that Stacy is crying over the TV show.

               LINDA (CONT'D)
     God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's
     just David Soul and Ricardo
     Montalban.

               STACY 
     I don't know, I'm just so
     depressed. Everything is just so...
     depressing.

Linda shuts off the television.

               LINDA 
     You have been acting very strange
     the last few weeks.

               STACY 
     I don't know... I just don't feel
     right.

Linda sits down next to Stacy on the bed.

               LINDA 
     What do you think it is?

               STACY 
     What do you think it is?

               LINDA 
     It couldn't be.

               STACY 
     It could be. I had a pregnancy test
     at the clinic. I'll find out
     Monday. I guess it was Damone.

               LINDA 
     Of course it was Damone. If it was
     Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!

               STACY 
     I'm not going to tell him. He's an
     asshole. I hate him.

               LINDA 
     But it costs money to have an
     abortion. Even at the Free Clinic.
     You tell Damone to pay for it. It's
     the least he can do. It's the guy's
     responsibility too.

She puts the TV back on and they watch.

               STACY 
     You know, there's one thing you
     didn't tell me about guys.

               LINDA 
     What?

               STACY 
     You didn't tell me that they can be
     so nice, so great... but then you
     sleep with them and they start
     acting like they're five years old.

               LINDA 
     You're right. I didn't tell you
     that.

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - TWO DAYS LATER

Stacy Hamilton is walking towards Mike Damone on
the football field. We see him from a distance,
timing track runners.

               DAMONE 
     What's going on?

               STACY 
     Mike, there's something that's been
     on my mind and I have to tell you
     about it.

               DAMONE 
     What? Now?

He clicks off the time on a runner, and then turns
to face her.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     Why don't you call me up tonight?

               STACY 
     Mike. I want you to know that I'm
     pregnant.

ANGLE ON STACY

as she looks down. They are words she never thought
she would be speaking.

               DAMONE 
     How do you know it's mine? We only
     did it once.

               STACY 
     I know it's yours.

ANGLE ON DAMONE

as he realizes she is sincere, and he truly begins
to panic.

               DAMONE 
     You made me do it! You locked the
     door. You made me do it! You wanted
     it more than me!

ANGLE ON STACY

She does not flinch.

               STACY 
     Take that back.

               DAMONE 
     All right, I take it back.

ANGLE ON DAMONE

He hugs his arms tighter across his chest, and
decides to try a more mature tact.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     There's only one thing we can do.
     We've got to get rid of it. We've
     got to get an abortion.

               STACY 
     We've got to get an abortion?

               DAMONE 
     Yeah. My brother Art got his
     girlfriend one once.

               STACY 
     It's already planned, Mike. It's
     going to cost $150 at the Free
     Clinic.

               DAMONE
     Doesn't sound free to me.
          (pause)
     So you want me to pay for it?

               STACY
     Half. Okay?
          (bites back tears)
     Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to
     the clinic.

               DAMONE
     Seventy-five dollars, and a ride.
     Okay.

Stacy stands there, hands folded, nodding.

                           DISSOLVE
                           TO:

INT. DAMONE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

He is working at his desk, counting through a wad
of money.

ANGLE ON THE LIST

in front of him, which has a split line down the
middle. People Who Owe Me -- fifteen dollars Rick.
People I Owe -seventy-five dollars REO Speedwagon
tickets, seventy-five dollars abortion. Damone
counts fifteen dollars into his stack, crosses out
Rick. Then he counts through the money. Seventy
five dollars exactly. He crosses out REO Speedwagon
tickets. This leaves him no money for the abortion.

EXT. STREET CORNER - AFTERNOON

Here, at the same corner where she once waited for
Ron Johnson, Stacy waits for Damone. Cars pass, no
Damone.

INT. HAMILTON HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Stacy is on the phone, calling Damone. We see the
phone messages sheet that lists two calls for
Stacy, and none for Brad. The line rings four
times, then it's answered.

               FEMALE VOICE
     Hello?

               STACY 
     Hello... is Mike there?

               FEMALE VOICE 
     Hold on.

Stacy sags, disbelieving, and looks at the clock on
the kitchen wall. It's getting late...

               FEMALE VOICE (CONT'D)
     He says he's helping his father in
     the garage and he'll call you back.

Stacy is stunned.

               FEMALE VOICE (CONT'D)
     Hello?

Stacy hangs up. She punches out another number,
quickly.

               MRS. BARRETT (V.O.) 
     Hello?

               STACY 
     Hi, Mrs. Barrett. Is Linda there?

               MRS. BARRETT (V.O.) 
     She went off to the beach. She'll
     be back later, though.

               STACY 
     Okay. Thanks.

She looks at the clock again, then hears a noise in
the driveway.

               STACY (CONT'D)
     Brad! Hey, wait a second!

She runs out.

EXT. CRUISING VESSEL - AFTERNOON

Brad and Stacy pull up next to the flea market.

               STACY 
     Yeah. This is it. I have some
     shopping to do.

               BRAD
     See you later.

               STACY
     Thanks a lot, Brad. I really
     appreciate it.

She gets out of the car.

EXT. FLEA MARKET

Stacy Hamilton watches her brother drive away. Then
she looks to both sides, and walks on. She passes
the entrance to the Flea Market. She walks around
the corner to another building marked BIRTH CONTROL
- FREE CLINIC. Brad follows her in the rearview
mirror.

INT. BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC

Stacy is lying in bed wearing a paper dress. Her
hair is stuffed in paper shower cap. She looks
anxious. In a bed next to her an older girl is
being affectionate with her visiting boyfriend.

A Nurse comes in with an IV.

               NURSE
     This is going to prick a little.

She sticks the needle into Stacy's hand. Stacy
looks pained but doesn't yell. The Nurse pats the
rolling bed.

               NURSE (CONT'D)
     Now scoot over here.

Stacy moves onto it. Looking up from her point of
view, we see the ride out of the room and into:

INT. OPERATING ROOM

Stacy gets wheeled in. The Doctor looks down at
her.

               DOCTOR
     Hello, Stacy, I'm Doctor Bartell.

Stacy moves onto the operating table as the Nurse
and Doctor get ready.

               DOCTOR (CONT'D)
     Any questions before we begin?

               STACY 
     This is going to hurt, isn't it?

               DOCTOR 
     We'll use a local but you'll feel
     some pressure. It doesn't last that
     long.

               STACY 
     Does it hurt more to have a baby?

The Doctor pauses and considers her question.

               DOCTOR 
     Yes... but I think you mind it
     less.

Stacy looks up at the lights and listens to the
sound of suction tubes.

INT. B.C. WAITING AREA

The other girl and Stacy sit at a table eating
toast and jelly. The girl is reading. The Nurse
enters.

               NURSE 
     How are we doing in here? Debbie,
     ready to leave?

The girl nods and gets up.

               NURSE (CONT'D)
     Right through here. Stacy, I can't
     let you go unless you have a ride
     home.

               STACY 
     Uh, my boyfriend said held be
     waiting downstairs.

The Nurse studies her, decides she's telling the
truth and allows her to leave.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE FREE CLINIC

Stacy walks back out into the sunlight, slowly and
weakly. She is surprised and amazed at who she sees
standing outside, waiting for her.

ANGLE ON BRAD HAMILTON

He stands, hands on hips, just outside the door.

               STACY 
     Brad!

He puts an arm around her and leads her toward his
waiting car.

               BRAD
     Since when do you shop at the Flea
     Market anyway?

               STACY
     Brad. Please don't tell Mom and
     Dad...

He helps her into the cruising vessel. He starts up
the car and drives off.

               BRAD 
     Who did it?

Stacy stares out the window. Tears well in her
eyes.

               BRAD (CONT'D)
     You're not going to tell me, are
     you?

               STACY 
     No.

               BRAD 
     All right, then. It's your secret.

Stacy smiles at Brad. Brad smiles back. The car
drives on.

INT. LINDA'S ROOM - NIGHT

Stacy is in Linda's room, sitting on her bed. Her
eyes are red and moist from crying. Linda listens
to her story.

               STACY 
     I really thought he would show up.
     I waited... and waited... and
     waited...

               LINDA 
     That little prick.

               STACY 
     Then I called his house, and his
     mother told me he was in the garage
     helping his father.

               LINDA 
     That little prick.

               STACY 
     I paid for it and everything.

               LINDA 
     There goes your stereo for another
     year. Mike Damone is a no-brain
     little prick. I'm not letting him
     get away with this.

               STACY 
     Don't do anything, Linda. I'd
     rather just forget about it. I
     don't even like the guy.

               LINDA 
     Stacy, he's not a guy. 
          (loud)
     He's a little prick! 

Stacy lies back on the bed.

EXT. DAMONE HOUSE - MORNING

The front door to the Damone house opens, and out
walks Mike Damone carrying some books. He looks
troubled, burdened, and stares down at the walkway
as he moves towards his car. He walks around,
starts to pen the car door, then he sees it. There,
in white spray paint across the driver's door, is
the message: PRICK.

               DAMONE
     Shhhhhhhhhit.

He looks both ways, and starts back towards the
house.

EXT. DAMONE CAR

Mike Damone travels down Ridgemont Drive, making
the turn into the school parking lot. There is a
large cardboard panel taped on the side of his car.

EXT. DAMONE'S LOCKER

He arrives at his locker, where, in white spray
paint, there is another message: LITTLE PRICK.
Several girls walk by, they laugh knowingly.

               GIRL #1 
     Hi, Mike!

               GIRL #2 
     Hi, mike!

Damone backs up against the locker, with a sick
smile on his face.

               DAMONE 
     Hi... girls.

More students pass, looking strangely at the young
man pinned against his own locker.

EXT. BOY'S LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON

Damone exits the boys locker room. Just as he does,
he is accosted by The Rat. We have never quite
heard this tone in The Rat's voice before.

               THE RAT 
     Damone? What happened between you
     and Stacy?

Damone feigns The Attitude, shakes his head. Damone
sighs.

               DAMONE 
     Let me tell you something, Rat.
     Sometimes girls just go haywire. It
     was a month ago, I've been trying
     to think of a way to tell you ever
     since. We started messing around
     and... 
          (shrugs)
     ... something happened. It's all
     over with. It's no big deal. I
     never called her again.

The Rat says nothing.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     If you ask me, she's pretty
     aggressive. You understand what I'm
     saying?

               THE RAT 
     No Damone. I don't understand.

               DAMONE 
     She wasn't really your girlfriend
     anyway.

               THE RAT 
     Hey fuck you Damone. There's a lot
     of girls out there and you mess
     around with Stacy. What have you
     got to prove?

               DAMONE 
     Jesus. I'm sorry.

               THE RAT 
     I always stick up for you. Whenever
     people say 'Aw, that Damone is a
     loudmouth' -- and they say that a
     lot -- I say 'You just don't know
     Damone.' When someone says you're
     an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not
     an idiot. You just don't know him.'
     Well, you know, Damone, maybe they
     do know you pretty good. And I'm
     just finding out.

               DAMONE 
     Fine. Get lost.

Damone starts to push past him, but The Rat shoves
his shoulder hard.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     All right, Rat. You want to do
     something about it?

Damone begins the classic high school fighting
ritual. He throws his books down. He takes a step
back. He goes into a crouch. He gestures towards
himself. Then Damone says the universally
recognized high school fighting words.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     Well come on.

The Rat shows no fear. As other kids begin to crowd
around the two boys, Rat throws his own books down.
He takes a step back, goes into the crouch. He
gestures toward himself.

               THE RAT
     You come on.

They stand there, gesturing, neither one of them
wanting to make the first move.

               DAMONE
     No. You come on, you wuss.

Assistant Coach Mr. Sexton comes running out of the
boy's locker room, and steps in front of the two
boys.

               SEXTON
     Hey! Knock this crap off!!

The Rat stalks off, disappearing into the crowd of
onlookers.

                           DISSOLVE
                           TO:

EXT. RIDGEMONT DRIVE - NIGHT

The Ridgemont Drive strip is filled with cars,
cruising for parties. There is a lot of honking,
and yelling out windows. Everyone is headed towards
the beach. We stay on a lowly 7-11 store near the
freeway entrance.

EXT. 7-11 STORE - NIGHT

A yellow Firebird slowly, menacingly cruises the
empty parking lot. It does not stop.

Then, around the corner, walks Jeff Spicoli. We see
him in the neon 7-11 light, his hands stuffed deep
into the pockets of baggy jeans. He walks inside
the store. He is the only shopper.

INT. 7-11 STORE

Brad Hamilton stands behind the counter in a red
and white striped shirt and cap, making fresh
coffee. Jeff Spicoli trudges up to the counter. He
looks at Brad. Brad looks at Spicoli. There is an
unspoken edge between them.

               SPICOLI
     Hey, mon, can I use the bathroom?

Brad squints his eyes, looks at the sign on the
back room door.

ANGLE ON

sign which reads: Rest Room For Employees Only.

               BRAD
     Go ahead. Just make it quick.

               SPICOLI
     Totally.

               BRAD
     It's the first door on your left.

Spicoli disappears into the back room. Brad sighs,
looks at the clock. It reads: 11:15. Then he hears
Spicoli from the back room.

               SPICOLI (O.S.)
     I can't find it, mon!

               BRAD
     It's the first door on your left!

               SPICOLI (O.S.)
     On the ledge?

               BRAD
     First door on your left!

               SPICOLI (O.S.)
     There it is!

Brad sighs again. He loads a new filter into the
coffee maker.

EXT./INT. 7-11 STORE

A moment later, the yellow Firebird pulls into the
7-11 parking lot. A man in a windbreaker comes
hurtling out of the car, into the store. He spray
paints the scanning camera above the door. He
hustles up to the counter, produces a .45 Magnum
and points it chest high at Brad. There is a glazed
and nervous speedy edge to his voice.

               ROBBER
     I want money. And I want it all --
     now.

Brad looks pale and young under the fluorescent 7
11 light.

He speaks slowly.

               BRAD
     They empty and close the big safe
     here at midnight.

               ROBBER
          (getting tougher)
     I know this store. I know where the
     safe is.

He bangs the gun on the counter, hard.

               ROBBER (CONT'D)
     Over there behind the donut case.
     Now move!

Brad slowly moves to the donut case, like a zombie.

               BRAD
     I'm instructed to tell you that we
     are on a video alarm system and
     there are other hidden cameras in
     the store ...

               ROBBER
     Just give me the money. Move it.

               BRAD
     Okay.
          (legs are shaking)
     I just started here, and they just
     taught me the procedure. I'll give
     you the money, just let me figure
     this out.

               ROBBER
          (very menacing)
     Move it. Move it.

Brad opens the phony back of the donut case and
fiddles with the strongbox combination.

               ROBBER (CONT'D)
          (more menacing)
     Let's go, stupid.

Brad looks at the gunman.

               BRAD
     You motherfucker. Get off my
     fuckin' case.

The Robber is about to react when the bathroom door
opens and Jeff Spicoli starts out, wiping his hands
on his pants.

               SPICOLI
     No towels, mon...

The Robber turns to look at Spicoli, and that is
all that Brad Hamilton needs. Just like it is the
most natural thing in the world, Brad reaches for
the hot, steaming coffee pot he has just made and
throws it into the gunman's face and hands.

               ROBBER
     Aaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrr!!!

The .45 falls out of his hand and rattles to the
floor. The gunman is still grabbing his face, and
looking at his skinless hands in horror when Brad
snaps up the gun. In the parking lot, the gunman's
accomplice, poised behind the wheel of the yellow
Firebird, spots the foul-up and screeches out of
the parking lot.

               BRAD
     There goes your ride home.

Brad pulls the under-counter alarm with newfound
confidence. Jeff Spicoli stands there, mesmerized
at the entire event.

               SPICOLI
     Awesome. Totally awesome.

EXT. RIDGEMONT MALL - NIGHT

Kids are pouring into the Ridgemont mall. Summer
banners are already up.

INT. THE MALL - NIGHT

In the midst of all the kids and shoppers, we see
The Rat walking slowly down the promenade. He is
wearing an Army surplus jacket, and his hands are
buried deep in his pockets. 

Two girls pass his way. One smiles briefly at him,
and The Rat turns to watch her pass. He is about to
say something to her, then no. He walks on, sees
Swenson's Ice-Cream Parlor up ahead. The Rat
decides to walk the other way.

INT. SWENSON'S - NIGHT

The place is busy again, filled with shoppers and
teenagers in summer-type clothing.

We see Stacy Hamilton, once again, at the cash
register wearing an Assistant manager name tag and
a hostess gown.
She handles a customer's bill, then stands there a
moment, looking glum. Linda Barrett approaches.

               STACY
     Another summer of working at
     Swenson's.

               LINDA
     Come on. There's lots of men around
     here. Keep your eyes open.

               STACY 
     You know, Linda. I've finally
     figured it out. It's not sex I
     want. Anyone can have sex.

               LINDA 
     What do you want?

               STACY 
     I want romance.

               LINDA
     Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even
     get cable TV.

ANGLE ON

the back kitchen door, which swings open, and out
comes Mike Damone in a peppermint Swenson's shirt.
He wipes some grime on his pants.

               STACY 
     Mike! You have a mess on C-9!

               DAMONE 
     All right. All right. I just
     cleaned B-8. Give me a break.

               STACY 
     Get going.

The two girls smile, go back to their posts.

INT. JEFF SPICOLI'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jeff Spicoli sits in his room, and it is his
castle. Clothes lie in disarray on the floor. A
huge half-waxed surfboard is propped against the
window. We see Spicoli dressed in a too large white
short-sleeved shirt, attempting to tie his father's
fat paisley tie. He stops to take a hit from his
bong, all the while talking on the phone. The music
of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Freebird" plays on the radio.

               SPICOLI 
     I... am... so... wasted, mon. What
     is in this shit?
          (pause)
     Doesn't that stuff cause brain
     damage?
          (pause)
     Bitchin'.

Spicoli listens for a moment. He rubs his eyes,
shakes his head. He is really buzzed.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     Hey, mon, I am going to Mexico as
     soon as school is out. Two more
     weeks, bud. Week from Wednesday.
          (pause)
     I am gonna take both boards, my
     duck feet, many cases of beer, and
     just jam.
          (pause)
     No, mon, from school. I'm leaving
     as soon as school gets out. I'll be
     at Sunset Cliffs by nighttime.
          (pause)
     Totally.
          (pause)
     Later.

Spicoli hangs up, and concentrates on tying his
tie. He almost strangles himself. Then suddenly the
door to his room flies open and Spicoli's little
brother Curtis bursts in.

               CURTIS 
     Jeff you have company!

               SPICOLI 
     Go away, Curtis. If you can't
     knock, I can't hear you.

Curtis slams the door and leaves. A moment later
there is a knock.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     That's better. Come in.

The door swings open and Jeff Spicoli sits in
stoned shock at the sight before him. There,
standing in the doorway of his room is Mr. Hand.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     Mr... Mr. Hand.

               MR. HAND 
     That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come
     in?

Spicoli can only nod.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
          (calling downstairs)
     Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Spicoli.

Hand walks into Spicoli's room, takes off his suit
jacket and lays it on the chair back. He stops a
moment and catches the stare of Miss January
Penthouse on the wall, then turns to Spicoli.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     Were you going somewhere tonight,
     Jeff?

               SPICOLI 
     Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr.
     Hand. It's the last school event of
     the year.

               MR. HAND 
     I'm afraid we've got some things to
     discuss here, Jeff.

               SPICOLI 
     Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?

Hand removes several copies of Oui Magazine from
another chair and sits down. He sets his briefcase
on Spicoli's dresser, next to a bag of pot, and
opens it up for easy access.

               MR. HAND 
     Do you want to sit there, Jeff?

               SPICOLI 
     I don't know. I guess so.

               MR. HAND 
     Fine. You sit right here on your
     bed. I'll use the chair here. 
          (pause)
     As I explained to your parents just
     a moment ago, and to you many times
     since the very beginning of the
     school year -- I don't like to
     spend my time waiting for late
     students, or detention cases. I'd
     rather be preparing the lesson.

Mr. Hand takes a sheet from his briefcase and looks
at it. 

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     According to my calculations, Mr.
     Spicoli, you wasted a total of
     eight hours of my time this year.
     And rest assured that is a kind
     estimate.

He returns the sheet to his case and looks into
Spicoli's weed-ravaged eyes.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare
     moment for me. Now I have the
     unique pleasure of squaring our
     account. Tonight, you and I are
     going to talk in great detail about
     the Davis Agreement, all the
     associated treaties, and the
     American Revolution in particular.
     Now if you can just turn to Chapter
     47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.

               SPICOLI 
     Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.

               MR. HAND 
     Well, then, I'm glad I remembered
     to bring an extra copy just for
     you.

Hand reaches in his case and produces the book. He
hands it to Spicoli.

                           DISSOLVE
                           TO:

INT. SPICOLI'S ROOM - HOURS LATER

Wearily, Spicoli is trying to grasp the material.

               SPICOLI 
     ... so, like, when Jefferson went
     before the people what he was
     saying was 'Hey, we left this place
     in England because it was bogus,
     and if we don't come up with some
     cool rules ourself, we'll be bogus,
     too!' Right?

ANGLE ON MR. HAND

who nods his head.

               MR. HAND 
     Very close, Jeff.

Hand reaches over and gets his case.

               MR. HAND (CONT'D)
     I think I've made my point with you
     tonight.

               SPICOLI
     Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a
     question?

               MR. HAND 
     What's that?

               SPICOLI 
     Do you have a guy like me every
     year? A guy to... I don't know,
     make a show of. Teach other kids
     lessons and stuff?

               MR. HAND 
     Well, you'll find out next year.

               SPICOLI 
          (smiling)
     No way, mon. When I graduate U.S.
     history I ain't even coming over to
     your side of the building.

               MR. HAND 
     If you graduate.

               SPICOLI 
          (panicked)
     You're gonna flunk me?!

Mr. Hand pauses a moment, then breaks into the
nearest approximation of a grin we have seen all
year. It isn't much, but it's noticeable. His lips
crinkle at the ends.

               MR. HAND 
     Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll
     probably squeak by.

               SPICOLI 
     All right! Oh, yeah!

Mr. Hand has now gathered all his material, and he
stands to approach Spicoli's door. Jeff jumps up,
extends his hand.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     Aloha, Mr. Hand!

               MR. HAND 
     Aloha, Spicoli.

Mr. Hand exits the room, and descends the staircase
of the Spicoli household. Spicoli kicks the door
shut, grins, and continues struggling with his tie.

INT. RIDGEMONT GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

Tight angle on the emotion-filled face of the lead
singer in a cheesy high school band called the T
Birds. He is bathed in a blue light, singing the
last verse of The Eagles' 'Take It To The Limit'.

We pull back to reveal a large, clumsy banner
reading: LAST DANCE. Students are pouring into the
gym for this event. Many have brought their annual
yearbooks. On stage, the lead singer snaps his
fingers and the band goes into Nick Lowe's 'Heart
of the City'. Some students start to dance.

Every one of our characters is either here, or
about to arrive. From Charles Jefferson to Spicoli
to Mr. Hand. For once, all classes are partying
together. But, just as in the beginning of the year
on lunch court, the kids are still cordoned off
into their distinctive cliques.

ANGLE ON MORE STUDENTS ARRIVING

at the Last Dance. They see Mr. Hand signing
annuals by the door. They all say the same thing as
they pass, "Aloha, Mr. Hand". He nods in return.

ANGLE ON STACY

surveying the growing mob of annual-crazed
students. From behind her comes Linda Barrett in a
low-cut black dress.

               STACY
     Where's Doug?

               LINDA
     He's not coming.

               STACY
     Not coming? What happened?

               LINDA
     He says he's got to stay in
     Chicago.
          (sighs)
     He says I should visit him
     sometimes.

               STACY
     Sometime?

               LINDA
     Yeah, like maybe never.

               STACY
     But what are you going to do?

               LINDA
     Well I might go to Dartmouth.

               STACY
     Dartmouth?!

               LINDA
     I didn't tell anyone I applied
     cause I never thought I'd make it.

               STACY
     I can't believe it! But what about
     Doug?

               LINDA (STOIC)
     There's a world of guys out there.
     I just wish I didn't have to date
     any of them.

               STACY
     Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his
     loss.

ANGLE ON MIKE DAMONE

in another part of the dance, by the Junior class
sponsored food counter. Damone is standing, talking
to several girls, gesturing and being Damone, Mr.
Attitude.

               DAMONE
     Sign my annual, honey. 

The girls look at each other, laugh. They walk
away.

ANGLE ON THE RAT

standing nearby.

               THE RAT
     You're losing it, Damone.

               DAMONE 
     You're crazy. Those girls love me.

ANGLE ON JEFF SPICOLI

sprawled out in the bleachers with his surfer
stoner buddies. He turns to one admiring stoner
(Todd).

               SPICOLI 
     Hey, mon. Sign my annual.

Spicoli slips the annual into the kid's crotch. The
stoner winces in pain, but still opens the book and
lingers on all the signings in Spicoli's annual.
They are all drug-related messages from fellow
stoners. After a moment, Spicoli's friend signs:
"Thanks for the reds. Todd."

               TODD
     Hey, mon, good thing we're going to
     Mexico this summer. 'Cause you're
     gonna get kicked out of your house
     when your parents read your annual.

INT. GYMNASIUM - ANGLE ON DOOR

Brad Hamilton pushes both doors open, and makes his
entrance into the Last Dance. There is a lot of
activity going on, but all nearby eyes turn to Brad
as he walks into the dance. Fifteen kids
immediately gravitate towards him. They all want
Brad to sign their annuals, to talk about the 7-11
incident. Onstage, the T-Birds play the Beatles'
"It Won't Be Long".

We see Brad's old girlfriend Lisa push up to him.
Her new jock boyfriend holds a protective arm
around her.

               LISA 
     I saw your picture in the paper.
     You had the greatest look on your
     face!

               ANOTHER STUDENT 
     Front of the Metro Section. I'm
     telling my parents, 'I know this
     guy, I know this guy.'

Lisa's boyfriend pulls his arm tighter around her.

               LISA 
     Will you sign my annual, Brad?

Brad smiles, nods. He signs, and gives her his. We
then see Brad's three Buddies from Carl's Jr. come
up, pat him on the back and grab his shoulder. Brad
studies them warily.

               BUDDY #1 
     Fuckin' manager of 7-11!

               BUDDY #2 
     Get us jobs over there, Brad! You
     can do it!

               BRAD 
     Since when do you guys want to work
     at 7-11?

               BUDDY #2 
     Come on, Brad! It would be great!
     All of us together!

               BRAD 
     Well, 7-11 is a tremendous
     operation. It's really changed,
     man. They've got great food, great
     magazines, videogames... it's
     class. Total class.

               BUDDY #3 
     As soon as you can get us in there,
     we're gone from Carl's, Brad.

               BUDDY #2 
     Yeah, man, all the little punks
     from junior high have taken over
     the place.

Brad leaves his old buddies. He grins and notices
someone across the crowded dance floor.

               BRAD 
     Hey, Thompson! Wendell! Get a job!

They laugh, flip him off. Brad is back in his
element at last. He moves into the main dancing
area, works his way across the room, past the
bleachers, when he hears a voice.

               SPICOLI (O.S.) 
     Hamilton!

Brad turns around, seen Spicoli sitting on the
bottom rung of the bleachers. Spicoli looks back
with true respect.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     Awesome.

He throws Brad his annual. Brad gives him his. They
sign.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     Easy, mon.

               BRAD 
     Later.

ANGLE ON THE BLEACHERS

where several couples are passionately making out.
Four teachers clomp up into the stands from
different angles. They pin the couples in
flashlight beams, like the main tower pinning an
escaping prisoner.

ANGLE ON THE T-BIRDS

onstage, singing the Rolling Stones' "I'm Free".

EXT. GYNMASIUM - NIGHT

We see Jeff Spicoli leave the dance and come
backing down the stairs with a stoner bud. His fist
is in the air.

               SPICOLI
     Summer, mon! We're there!

He turns to his stoner bud.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     Let's roll, my man.

Spicoli backs right into a young buzz-cut kid.

               SPICOLI (CONT'D)
     Hey, bud! Watch yourselff

Spicoli turns around to see he's backed into a
squad of eight Lincoln Surf Nazis. They are all
standing on the steps, waiting.

               SURF NAZI
     Are you Jeff Spicoli?

Spicoli looks up and down the row of Surf Nazis. On
the end, he sees L.C.

               L.C.
     That's him! He did it!

               SPICOLI
     Hey, mon, I don't know what your
     trip is, but...

Spicoli dashes off down Luna Street. L.C. and the
Surf Nazis take out in hot pursuit, chasing him
through the parking lot, past Ridgemont High, and
into the night. They will never catch him.

                           SLOW
                           DISSOLVE:

INT. RIDGEMONT MALL

School is out and it's summer business as usual at
the Ridgemont Mall. We see the same stores, the
same packs of kids roaming the three tiers.

ANGLE ON MARK RATNER

who stands against the railing in his Cinema Four
jacket, gazing across the mall at Swenson's Ice
Cream Parlor. He sees Stacy walk two girlfriends to
the outdoor front tables, and almost look his way.
The Rat turns away suddenly. Then he hears her
calling out after him.

               STACY 
     Hey Mark! Turn around!

Ratner turns around, affects total and complete
cool. He waves across the mall to her.

               STACY (CONT'D)
     Come over here!

He looks back at his post at the theatre, decides
it's okay to step away. He walks across the mall.

INT. SWENSON'S

Stacy is standing by the sundae bar. Next to her
are two empty stools. After a moment, we see The
Rat plop onto one of the metal stools. He pounds
the seat next to him with the palm of his hand.

               THE RAT 
     You. Sit.

Stacy turns to look at him, smiles. She sits.

               STACY 
     Hi, Mark.

               THE RAT 
     Hi, Stacy. How are you?

               STACY 
     I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you
     came over here because I want you
     to know something. I just thought I
     would tell you that I really
     enjoyed getting to know you this
     year.

The Rat maintains The Attitude.

               THE RAT 
     Yeah? About fifty people I didn't
     know wrote that in my annual.

               STACY 
     I know everybody says it, but I
     really mean it.

The Rat looks at her from the corner of his eyes.

               THE RAT 
     Really?

               STACY 
     Yeah. I want you to have this
     picture, so you won't forget what I
     look like. And so you'll remember
     to call me over the summer.

She withdraws a picture from her pocket, hands it
to The Rat.

               THE RAT 
     Well, I don't know, I may be doing
     some traveling this summer. I don't
     know how much I'll be around... 
          (breaks down, takes
          picture)
     But I'll give you a call sometime.

               STACY 
     I'd like that.

She gives him a kiss on the mouth, gets up and
walks away. The Rat sits there, smiling at the way
things sometimes turn out. He slips the picture
into his pocket, a satisfied young man.

INT./EXT. SWENSON'S AND MALL

The Rat is joined by Mike Damone, who has changed
into his street clothes.

               DAMONE 
     She wants it, Rat.

The Rat snickers, shakes his head.

               DAMONE (CONT'D)
     I saw you. You had pure Attitude.

The Rat turns to look at his friend.

               THE RAT
     The Attitude, Damone, is only good
     until you meet the right girl.

               DAMONE
     Whatever you say, Rat.

They take off together, blending into the crowd of
kids walking the mall.

               THE RAT 
     And... you can only tell it's the
     right girl if you're sensitive.

               DAMONE 
     Sensitive -- what is that?

               THE RAT 
     Sensitive is when you can tell how
     people feel without asking.

               DAMONE 
     So what makes you so sensitive?

               THE RAT 
     Well, for one, I read. I don't
     watch as much television as you.
     I'm trying to feel things more. I'm
     learning a lot about people.

               DAMONE 
     What do you read? What's the last
     book you read?

               THE RAT 
     Lust For Life. It's the story of
     Vincent Van Gough.

               DAMONE 
          (scoffs)
     Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That
     must mean I'm sensitive too.

               THE RAT
     It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I
     put it out, and I have personally
     found that girls do respond.

Damone laughs, shoves him hard. We lose sight of
the two boys in the sea of kids.
