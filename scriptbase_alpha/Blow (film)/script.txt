                                         ON BLACK:

     "A MAN MUST LOOK AT HIS LIFE AND THINK LUXURY."

     FADE IN:

     EXT. GUARJIRA, COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY

     A majestic panorama of the lush green slopes that are the
     Columbian highlands.  A faint chopping sound IS HEARD and
     then another.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  The view changes and tiny
     dots appear on the hillside vegetation.  WHOOSH.

     CLOSER

     We realize the dots are people.  Workers swinging long steel
     machetes in slow methodical rhythm.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  WE SEE
     the South American Indian MEN clearly now.  Their tar stained
     teeth.  Their gaunt faces riddled with crow's feet.  Their
     jaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect
     the harvest.

     EXT. DIRT ROAD - COLOMBIA - DAY

     Old rickety trucks carrying the huge green tractor-sized
     bales speed along the narrow road.

     EXT. CLEARING - COLOMBIA - DAY

     The bundles are undone and Columbian women separate out the
     leaves.  Tribes of underweight workers carry armload after
     armload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a
     gigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire.
     The leaves are being boiled down and a huge plume of smoke
     streaks the sky.  Wizened Indios brave the heat and shovel
     ashes into the pot to cool the solution.

     INT. JUNGLE - COLOMBIA - DAY

     A primitive but enormous makeshift lab contains all the
     equipment.  The machinery.  The solutions.  The over-sized
     vats.  Dark-skinned bandoleros smoke cigarettes and sport
     automatic weapons at all the points of entry.  The coca is
     now a "basuco" paste and is being sent in for a wash.

     INT. LABORATORY - COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY

     A conveyor belt pours out brick after brick of pure cocaine
     hydrochloride.  The bricks are wrapped, tied up, weighed, and
     stamped with a "P" before being thrown into duffel bags.

     EXT. JUNGLE AIRSTRIP - COLOMBIA - DAY

     A small twin-engine Cessna is loaded with dozens of duffel
     bags and the plane takes off.

     EXT. VERO BEACH AIRFIELD - NIGHT

     The Cessna touches down.

     EXT. WORKSITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY

     The worksite is busy.  George is amongst other workers,
     working a summer job.  As George is taking five, he looks
     across the sight to Fred, who is sweeping up debris.  A long
     way from being the boss.

     INT. COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OFFICE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY

     George stands in line to register for college, wearing his
     Brooks Brothers suit, bowtie, and freshly Bryllcreamed hair.
     The room is crowded and the line is long.  Bob Dylan's
     "Subterranean Homesick Blues" blares out of one of the kid's
     transistor radios.  George looks around the room.  He is
     uncomfortable.  He catches his reflection in the shiny glass
     partition and stops.  He doesn't like what he sees.
     Something is not right.  He looks like everyone else.  Same
     cookie-cutter hair, same cookie-cutter clothes, same cookie
     cutter faces.  He's a carbon copy.

                    REGISTRATION WOMAN
          Next.

     It's George's turn but he doesn't hear it.  "Twenty years of
     schooling and they put you on a day shift."  The words hit
     him like a tone of bricks as he continues to stare at his own
     reflection.

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          I was standing there, and it was like
          the outside of me and the inside of me
          didn't match, you know?  And then I
          looked around the room and it hit me.  I
          saw my whole life.  Where I was gonna
          live, what type of car I'd drive, who my
          neighbors would be.  I saw it all and I
          didn't want it.  Not that life.

     EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY

     George sits with Fred.  It's breaktime and Fred eats from a
     lunch box.

                    GEORGE
          There's something out there for me, Dad.
          Something different.  Something free
          form, you know?  Something for me, and
          college just isn't it.

                    FRED
          That's too bad.  You would have been the
          first one in the family.

                    GEORGE
          I know.

                    FRED
          Alright.  You want me to get your old
          job back?  Because I could, you know, I
          could put in that word.

                    GEORGE
          No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I
          just don't want...

     It's obvious to Fred that his son doesn't want to be like
     him.

                    FRED
          What are you going to do?

                    GEORGE
          I'm going to California.

     EXT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY

     SUPERIMPOSE: MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA 1968

     George and Tuna, now 21-years old, struggle with their bags.
     Their new place is a tackily furnished, two-story apartment
     with small balconies and a view of the ocean.  As George and
     Tuna struggle with the bags, two California beauties appear
     on the balcony next door: BARBARA BUCKLEY, 20, and MARIA
     GONZALES, 21.

                    GIRLS
          You guys need some help?

     George and Tuna share a look.

                    TUNA
          I don't know about you, but I think
          we're gonna like it here.

     EXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY

     SERIES OF SHOTS

     Barbara and Maria introduce George and Tuna around to the
     Manhattan Beach regulars.  They are immediately accepted
     despite their ill fitting shorts and Tuna's unhip black
     socks.  The beach scene is one big party.  Lots of beer,
     music, bikinis, and good times.  By the end of the day,
     George and Tuna have a hundred new friends.

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          California was like nothing I'd ever
          experienced.  The people were liberated
          and independent and full of new ideas.

                    GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          They used words like "right on,"
          "groovy," and "solid."  The women are
          all beautiful and seemed to share the
          same occupation.

                    WOMAN #1
          I'm a flight attendant.

                    WOMAN #2
          I'm a flight attendant.

                    WOMAN #3
          I'm a flight attendant.

     The weed comes out and is passed around.  Pipes.  Joints.
     Bongs.  In SLOW MOTION, Barbara takes a huge hit of grass,
     grabs George's face, french kissing him, and giving him a
     huge shotgun.

     INT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY

     George and Barbara are sleeping late.  Their bodies
     intertwined beneath the sheets.  A slam of the front door
     wakes them up.  It's Tuna.

                    TUNA
          Hey, wake up.  Come on, you two
          lovebirds.  Hurry, I want to show you
          something.

     George and Barbara shake cobwebs out and stumble into the
     kitchen to find Tuna holding a brown paper shopping bag.

                    TUNA (CONT'D)
          Figured it out.

                    GEORGE
          Figured what out?

                    TUNA
          You know how we were wondering what we
          were going to do for money?  Being how
          we don't want to get jobs and whatnot?
          Well, check this out.

     Tuna takes the paper bag and empties its contents on the
     kitchen table.  It's a grey mound of stocky, seedy marijuana.

     Barbara examines the reefer.

                    BARBARA
          Tuna, this is crap.

                    TUNA
          I know it's not the greatest.  It's
          commercial.

                    BARBARA
          It's garbage.

                    GEORGE
          It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal.
          What are you gonna do with all this?

                    TUNA
          We sell it.  I got it all figured out.
          We make three finger lids and sell them
          on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've
          made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a
          lot of weed for our head.  What do you
          think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies
          and everything.

                    BARBARA
          You can't sell this to your friends.

                    TUNA
          Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great
          idea and you guys have to be all
          skeptical.

                    BARBARA
          Look, if you really wanna score some
          dope, I got the guy.

     EXT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY

     George, Barbara and Tuna stop outside the front door.

                    GEORGE
          Are you sure this guy is cool?

                    BARBARA
          You'll see for yourself.

                    TUNA
          A beauty parlor for men?  Sounds pretty
          queer.

     They walk in.

     INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - CONTINUOUS

     George, Tuna and Barbara enter.  The Whipping Post is
     California's first male hair salon.  George looks around at
     the customer's being pampered.  Haircuts, pedicures,
     manicures.

                    GEORGE
          Nothing like this back home.

                    BARBARA
          Derek!

     DEREK FOREAL is a curious man.  Daringly effeminate,
     especially for the sixties, he is always surrounded by
     beautiful women.  As he sees Barbara, he stops his haircut
     and runs to embrace her.

                    DEREK
          Barbie!

     Derek's female entourage rush over as well.  Kisses all
     around.

                    DEREK (CONT'D)
          So, this is the new man, huh?  He's
          cute!

     George and Tuna stick out there hands.

                    GEORGE
          George.

                    TUNA
          Tuna.

                    DEREK
          Tuna, oh my.  Enchante, George.  Barbie,
          he's yummy.  He looks like a Ken doll.
          Oooh, Ken and Barbie.  It's perfect.
          Alright, girls, give me five minutes.

     Derek makes dismissing gestures and the girls scatter.

                    DEREK (CONT'D)
          Everyone, shoo!  You, too, Barbie.  I
          want to talk to the boys alone.

     After the girls leave, Derek closes the partition and his
     playful demeanor changes.  He's all business now.

                    DEREK (CONT'D)
          What can I do for you guys?

                    GEORGE
          We want some grass.

                    DEREK
          I know what you want.  But, first of
          all, are you cops?

                    GEORGE
          No.

                    DEREK
          Because if you are, you have to tell me.
          If not, it's entrapment.

                    GEORGE
          We're not cops.  We're from
          Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look
          like a cop?

                    DEREK
          I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're
          very lucky you're friends of Barbie's.
          If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.

     Derek pulls a television-sized brick of quality marijuana out
     from under a sink and sets it down in front of George.

                    GEORGE
          What the fuck is that?

                    DEREK
          It's your grass.

                    TUNA
          Wow.  That's more than we had in mind.

                    DEREK
          I don't nickel and dime.  You want it or
          not?

     George and Tuna look at each other.

                    GEORGE
          We'll take it.

     Summer on the beach.  It's one big party.  George and Tuna
     are on the beach.  They are the new kings.  They smoke pot
     and drink brews.
     George and Barbara get close as do Tuna and Maria.  Slowly,
     George's clothes and hair start to look better, cooler.

     into the sand.  The sky is streaked with purple and red.

          This is it for me.

                    BARBARA
          What is?

                    GEORGE
          Just everything.  You.  California.  The

          like I belong here, you know?  It just
          feels right.

          we don't want to get jobs and whatnot?
          Well, check this out.

     Tuna takes the paper bag and empties its contents on the
     kitchen table.  It's a grey mound of stocky, seedy marijuana.

     Barbara examines the reefer.

                    BARBARA
          Tuna, this is crap.

                    TUNA
          I know it's not the greatest.  It's
          commercial.

                    BARBARA
          It's garbage.

                    GEORGE
          It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal.
          What are you gonna do with all this?

                    TUNA
          We sell it.  I got it all figured out.
          We make three finger lids and sell them
          on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've
          made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a
          lot of weed for our head.  What do you
          think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies
          and everything.

                    BARBARA
          You can't sell this to your friends.

                    TUNA
          Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great
          idea and you guys have to be all
          skeptical.

                    BARBARA
          Look, if you really wanna score some
          dope, I got the guy.

     EXT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY

     George, Barbara and Tuna stop outside the front door.

                    GEORGE
          Are you sure this guy is cool?

                    BARBARA
          You'll see for yourself.

                    TUNA
          A beauty parlor for men?  Sounds pretty
          queer.

     They walk in.

     INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - CONTINUOUS

     George, Tuna and Barbara enter.  The Whipping Post is
     California's first male hair salon.  George looks around at
     the customer's being pampered.  Haircuts, pedicures,
     manicures.

                    GEORGE
          Nothing like this back home.

                    BARBARA
          Derek!

     DEREK FOREAL is a curious man.  Daringly effeminate,
     especially for the sixties, he is always surrounded by
     beautiful women.  As he sees Barbara, he stops his haircut
     and runs to embrace her.

                    DEREK
          Barbie!

     Derek's female entourage rush over as well.  Kisses all
     around.

                    DEREK (CONT'D)
          So, this is the new man, huh?  He's
          cute!

     George and Tuna stick out there hands.

                    GEORGE
          George.

                    TUNA
          Tuna.

                    DEREK
          Tuna, oh my.  Enchante, George.  Barbie,
          he's yummy.  He looks like a Ken doll.
          Oooh, Ken and Barbie.  It's perfect.
          Alright, girls, give me five minutes.

     Derek makes dismissing gestures and the girls scatter.

                    DEREK (CONT'D)
          Everyone, shoo!  You, too, Barbie.  I
          want to talk to the boys alone.

     After the girls leave, Derek closes the partition and his
     playful demeanor changes.  He's all business now.

                    DEREK (CONT'D)
          What can I do for you guys?

                    GEORGE
          We want some grass.

                    DEREK
          I know what you want.  But, first of
          all, are you cops?

                    GEORGE
          No.

                    DEREK
          Because if you are, you have to tell me.
          If not, it's entrapment.

                    GEORGE
          We're not cops.  We're from
          Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look
          like a cop?

                    DEREK
          I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're
          very lucky you're friends of Barbie's.
          If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.

     Derek pulls a television-sized brick of quality marijuana out
     from under a sink and sets it down in front of George.

                    GEORGE
          What the fuck is that?

                    DEREK
          It's your grass.

                    TUNA
          Wow.  That's more than we had in mind.

                    DEREK
          I don't nickel and dime.  You want it or
          not?

     George and Tuna look at each other.

                    GEORGE
          We'll take it.

                    GEORGE
          Just everything.  You.  California.  The
          beach.  This spot right here.  I feel
          like I belong here, you know?  It just
          feels right.

     of a water pipe and coughing his ass off.

                    TUNA
          Look what the cat dragged in.

                    GEORGE
          Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you
          doing here?

                    KEVIN
          Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down
          the beach, minding my business, when who
          did I see but this fucking guy.  I
          didn't know you guys were living in
          California.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, but what are you doing out here?

                    KEVIN
          I'm on vacation.  On my way back to
          school.

                    GEORGE
          This calls for a joint.  You want to do
          the honors?

                    KEVIN
          No, man.  I'm too fucked up.

                    TUNA
          Nice weed, huh?

                    KEVIN
          Fuck yeah.  I never seen nothing like
          it.  I'm fucking wasted.

                    GEORGE
          Right on.

                    KEVIN
          G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm
          really...

          Stoned?

          I wish there was shit like this back
          home.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah?

                    KEVIN
          Shit, yeah.  Do you know how much money
          I could make if I had this stuff back
          east?

                    TUNA
          No shit, Kevin?

                    KEVIN
          That's right.

          Yeah?

                    KEVIN

          hundred thousand rich kids with their
          parents' money to spend, but there's
          never anything available.  Nothing good,

                    GEORGE
          The way we figure it, Barbara flies to
          Boston twice a week.  Two bags per
          flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.

                    DEREK
          You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred
          pounds a week.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.

                    BARBARA
          We're gonna call it California
          sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.

                    GEORGE
          I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.

                    DEREK
          I don't know...

                    GEORGE
          Here's the best part.  We can charge
          five-hundred a pound.

                    DEREK
          Come on, George, no one is going to pay
          that.

                    GEORGE
          It's already been negotiated.  It's
          done.  The money is there waiting.

     Derek looks at Barbara.  She nods.

                    DEREK
          Goodness.

                    GEORGE
          Goodness is right.  If you do the math,
          that's over thirty grand a week profit.
          I want you to be my partner on this,
          Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen
          thousand a week for you, my friend.  In
          your pocket, free and clear.

                    DEREK
          And I only deal with you?

                    GEORGE
          Barbara and me.  No one else.

     Derek thinks about it.

                    BARBARA
          It's gonna work, Derek.

                    DEREK
          I don't know.  East coast.  Airplanes.
          It all sounds pretty risky.

          I need more.

                    BARBARA
          What do you want me to do?  I can only
          take two bags, and I can't fly back here
          everyday.

                    KEVIN
          I know, but I've got a feeding frenzy on

          What's the matter, George?  Something
          wrong?  You look like you just fucked

          we're still paying retail.  We're
          getting middled.

          for him.

     EXT. STREETS - PUERTO VALLARTA - 1968 - DAY

     George and Ramon climb into a beat up V.W. bug and take off.

     EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - PUERTO VALLARTA - 1968 - DAY

     Fields and Farms.  The V.W. bug pulls up to an old ranch.
     They get out of the bug and are greeted by SANTIAGO and his
     THREE SONS.

                    SANTIAGO
          Ramon tells me you are looking for some
          mota.

                    GEORGE
          Yes, I am.

     Santiago moves to a tarp and pulls it back to reveal many
     bales of green, seedless sinsemilla.

                    SANTIAGO
          For instance, something like this?

                    GEORGE
          Very nice.  I'll take it.

                    SANTIAGO
          Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how
          much will you be needing?

                    GEORGE
          All of it.  As much as you've got.  A
          couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back
          in a week with a plane.

                    SANTIAGO
          Listen, Americano, it is very nice to
          meet you, but maybe we are going too
          fast.  You take a little and then come
          back.

                    GEORGE
          I don't need a little.  I need a lot.

                    SANTIAGO
          Marijuana is illegal in my country, and
          I believe in yours, as well.  We must be
          careful.

                    GEORGE
          What if I brought you, let's say, fifty
          thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate
          some of your concerns?

                    SANTIAGO
          Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand
          dollars, and I have no more concerns.

     EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - 1968 - DAY

     A pair of boltcutters snaps the chain off a single-engine
     Cessna.

                    TUNA
          I can't believe we're stealing a plane.

                    KEVIN
          Don't be such a pussy.

                    GEORGE
          It's fine.  We're not stealing it.
          We're borrowing it.  And try to look
          natural.  We've got company.

     A MECHANIC working on the adjacent plane is giving them the
     hairy eyeball.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Be cool.

     The three boys nod their heads in acknowledgement and give a
     small wave.  The mechanic smiles and waves back.

     INT. CESSNA - 1968 - DAY

     The engine is on and the propeller is spinning.  Kevin is at
     the controls.  Tuna is not making the trip.  He pokes his
     head in before shutting the cockpit.

                    TUNA
          You guys are fucking insane.

     George reads from a flight manual.

                    GEORGE
          Alright, pull back the throttle...

     The engine screams.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Not that far, only halfway.  You sure
          you know what you're doing?

                    KEVIN
          Relax.  I've flown with my old man a
          million times.  And he always told me,
          the taking off part is easy, it's the
          landing you've got to worry about.

     EXT. SANTIAGO FARM - MEXICO - 1968 - DAY

     The plane tries to land.  It's a clumsy one.  The Cessna is
     tipping and touching, first one wheel, then another, almost
     sideways before straightening out and stopping.  George and
     Kevin hop out of the plane.  They are greeted by Santiago and
     the Mexican contingency.

                    AMIGOS
          Hola, George!  Bienvenido!

     George hands out presents to everyone.  He's like Santa
     Claus, giving gifts to every man, woman and child.  They love
     him.  Santiago pumps George's hand.

                    SANTIAGO
          Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man
          of your word.

                    GEORGE
          Actually, I've got some news.  That
          fifty thousand I promised you, I
          couldn't get it.

     George throws Santiago a duffel bag.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          So I brought you sixty.

     EXT. DRY LAKE BEDS - TWENTY-NINE PALMS, CA. - 1968 - DUSK

     Rada sits in the Winnebago and keeps flashing the headlights.
     Barbara, Tuna, and Maria stand on top of the Winnebago waving
     big, white towels.  The plane descends from the sky and
     touches down, making another extremely shaky landing.

     INT. FOREAL'S HOUSE - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - NIGHT

     It's on the water and beautiful.  The furnishings are
     distinctly Derek Foreal.  It's a surreal scene.
     The holiday decorations are up, TOPLESS WOMEN in elf outfits
     sip champagne, and a thousand pounds of cannabis lays on the
     living room floor.

                    GEORGE
          Are you sure you want to do this in
          front of everyone?

                    DEREK
          Don't be ridiculous, these are my
          babies.

     George empties the pot all over the floor.

                    DEREK (CONT'D)
          George, you're a genius.  We're rich.
          Come, children.

     The girls dive on top of Derek, caressing and kissing him.

                    DEREK (CONT'D)
          George, get my camera.

     Derek poses with a load of marijuana like it's a new fur.

                    DEREK (CONT'D)
          Take a picture of me, George.  Take a
          picture of me with my new friends.
          It'll be a fabulous Christmas card.

     INT. VILLA - PUERTO VALLARATA - 1970 - DAY

     A Mexican Real Estate Agent shows Barbara and George a
     sprawling Villa in Puerto Vallarta.  It's amazing.  White
     marble on the water.  George looks at Barbara.

                    GEORGE
          Should we buy it?

                    BARBARA
          Are you kidding?

                    GEORGE
          We'll take it.

     EXT. VILLA - PUERTO VALLARATA - 1970 - MAGIC HOUR

     The team is there.  All of them.  George, Barbara, Kevin,
     Rada, Tuna, Maria and Derek with a couple of new senorita
     friends.  They all wear identical Mexican sombreros.  A
     MEXICAN BOY approaches them with a camera.

                    MEXICAN BOY
          Picture?

     They pose, their arms thrown around each other in
     camaraderie, and FLASH.  The picture freezes and WE DISSOLVE.

     INT. THE BUGGY WHIP - WEYMOUTH - 1972 - NIGHT

     George is taking Barbara and his parents out to dinner.  The
     Buggy Whip is Ermine's favorite.

                    ERMINE
          I just can't get over the size of that
          ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at
          it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.

                    FRED
          I'm just happy that George has found
          someone he cares for.

                    ERMINE
          Yes.  Of course.  But, I'm talking about
          that ring.  It's something else.  Let me
          tell you.

                    BARBARA
          George has exquisite taste.

                    ERMINE
          What is that, two carats?  That's got to
          be two carats.

                    BARBARA
          I don't know.

                    ERMINE
          Yes.  It's at least two carats, darling.
          Treasure it.

                    FRED
          Hard to imagine being able to afford a
          ring like that on a construction salary.

     All eyes turn to George, who fumbles.

                    GEORGE
          Well, you know.  It's um...

                    ERMINE
          Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat
          mouth.  You don't buy it all at once.
          It's called layaway.

                    FRED
          Layaway shmayaway.

                    ERMINE
          That's right.  Layaway.  Something you
          wouldn't know anything about, you
          cheapskate.

                    FRED
          Who's the cheapskate?

                    ERMINE
          You, you big old tightwad.  He still has
          his communion money.  Tell him, George.
          Tell your father about layaway.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, layaway.

                    ERMINE
          The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a
          killjoy.

                    FRED
          Killjoy?

     George looks to Barbara, whose nose is bleeding.

                    GEORGE
          Honey, your nose!

                    BARBARA
          Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.

                    ERMINE
          Barbara, here, take my napkin.

                    BARBARA
          Thanks.  I'll be okay.

                    GEORGE
          You wanna split?

                    BARBARA
          Yeah, I don't feel so well.

                    GEORGE
          Okay, guys, we're gonna leave.  Let's
          get the check.

     EXT. THE BUGGY WHIP - WEYMOUTH - 1972 - LATER

     George and Barbara exit the restaurant.

                    GEORGE
          Are you sure you're okay?  You're pale.

                    BARBARA
          I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging
          nosebleeds.

                    GEORGE
          I'm taking you to the doctor when we get
          home, and I don't want to hear any
          arguments.

                    BARBARA
          Would you be bummed out if I didn't go
          to Chicago with you?

                    GEORGE
          No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right.
          You fly home and get some rest.

                    BARBARA
          Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in
          front of your parents.

                    GEORGE
          Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they?
          I wanted to shoot myself.

                    BARBARA
          Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they
          were kind of cute.

                    GEORGE
          Promise me that we'll never be like
          them.  I don't want to wind up like
          that.

                    BARBARA
          Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up
          like us.

     INT. POLICE STATION - CHICAGO - 1972 - DAY

     SUPERIMPOSE

     MUG SHOTS of George.  Left, right, center.  George sits
     handcuffed to a chair.  Piles of marijuana bricks roll past
     him.

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          I had a little problem in Chicago.
          Something about trying to sell a
          truckload of dope to an undercover
          officer.  So I applied the three rules
          of the game under if and when arrested.

     INT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CHICAGO - 1972 - DAY

     George and his COURT APPOINTED ATTORNEY stand before the
     JUDGE at the arraignment.

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          Rule one: don't fight.  A trial will
          cost you a fortune in lawyer's fees and
          the jury will chop off your balls and
          hand them to you on a platter.

                    JUDGE
          George Jung, you have been accused of
          possession of six-hundred and sixty
          pounds of marijuana with intent to
          distribute.  How do you plead?

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          Rule two: plead not guilty and get
          bailed out of jail.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Your honor, I'd like to say a few words
          to the court.

     The court appointed attorney puts his head in his hands.

                    JUDGE
          By all means.

                    GEORGE
          In all honesty, I don't feel like what
          I've done is a crime and I think it's
          illogical and irresponsible for you to
          sentence me to prison.  None of the real
          criminals of the world ever end up
          behind bars.  I mean, when you think
          about it, what did I really do?  Cross
          an imaginary line with a bunch of
          plants?  You say that I'm an outlaw, you
          say that I'm a thief, but where's the
          Christmas dinner for the people on
          relief?

     George stops when his attorney stamps on his foot.  The court
     officers roll their eyes and the judge smiles.

                    JUDGE
          Those are very interesting concepts you
          have, Mr. Jung.
          Unfortunately for you, the imaginary
          line you crossed is real, the plants you
          brought with you are illegal, and what
          you did constitutes a crime.

     The judge slams his gavel.

                    JUDGE (CONT'D)
          Bail is set at twenty-thousand dollars.

     EXT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CHICAGO - 1972 - NIGHT

     George walks out, free on bond, to find Barbara waiting for
     him.  She doesn't look so good.

                    BARBARA
          Surprise.

                    GEORGE
          Baby, you didn't have to come.

                    BARBARA
          What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not
          a chance.  So, what's the verdict?

                    GEORGE
          Lawyer says he can plead it down to five
          years.  I'll serve two.

                    BARBARA
          Two years.  George, I can't wait that
          long.

                    GEORGE
          What?  You're not going to wait for me?

                    BARBARA
          George, I went to the doctor.  I don't
          have two years.

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          Which brings me to rule number three:
          which says, fuck rules one and two, skip
          bail and take off.

     EXT. RENT-A-CAR - 1972 - DAY

     George hits the gas and the car screams down the road.

     EXT. VILLA - PUERTO VALLARTA - 1973 - GOLDEN HOUR

     George and Barbara sit on the veranda drinking champagne and
     watching the sun go down over the Pacific.  Barbara is
     completely bald.  Rail thin, eyes sunken.
     But it doesn't matter.  They're having a great time.  They
     laugh and hold hands and laugh some more.

     EXT. CEMETERY - PUERTO VALLARTA - 1973 - DAY

     Everyone is there.  All in black.  Barbara's casket is
     lowered into the ground and George climbs to his knees to
     push the first dirt on the grave.

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          Time is such a funny thing.  I look at
          where I am now, and in here, time inches
          along.  So slow, it hardly seems like it
          moves.  But back then, time went fast.

     EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1999 - DAY

     George pushes dirt along the edge of a flower root.  Still
     planting those sunflowers, he presses down firmly, standing
     before him is Barbara, still beautiful and young with flowing
     locks.  George raises his hand and makes a small wave.
     Barbara opens and closes her hand.  Bye bye.

                    GEORGE
          It went too fast.

     George looks down and Barbara is gone.  No Barbara.

     EXT. JUNG HOUSE - BACKYARD - WEYMOUTH - 1973 - NIGHT

     George hops the fence like he did when he was a boy and goes
     in the back door.

     INT. JUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

     Ermine looks at George blankly.

                    GEORGE
          Hi, Mom.

     Ermine just keeps looking at him.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Surprised to see me?

                    ERMINE
          Take your boots off.  You're tan.

                    GEORGE
          Mexico.

                    ERMINE
          Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want
          you to know I'm deeply sorry about your
          girlfriend.

                    GEORGE
          Barbara.

                    ERMINE
          Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.

                    GEORGE
          Thank you.  Have you been getting the
          money I sent you?

                    ERMINE
          You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.

     Ermine's hands are trembling.  She is emotional.  She hugs
     George ferociously, not letting go.

                    ERMINE (CONT'D)
          G-d, son.

                    GEORGE
          Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?

     George turns around to see Fred's beaming face.

     INT. JUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

     George and Fred sit at the table, a bottle of Scotch sits
     between them.  The glasses are raised.

                    GEORGE
          May the wind always be at your back and
          the sun always upon your face...

                    FRED
          ...and the winds of destiny carry you
          aloft...

                    BOTH
          ...to dance with the stars.

     The glasses clink and the drinks are sucked down.

     INT. JUNG HOUSE - LATER

     The bottle is dwindling.  George and Fred are feeling it.

                    FRED
          You alright?

     George nods.

                    GEORGE
          Just low.

                    FRED
          You loved her, didn't you?  You really
          loved her.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I
          gonna do?

                    FRED
          Tough spot.

     The glasses are refilled.

                    GEORGE
          You mad at me?

                    FRED
          Not mad.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way
          you look at me.

                    FRED
          I just don't know what you're thinking.
          I don't understand your choices.  You
          know, the police are looking for you.

                    GEORGE
          I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I
          mean, I'm really great.

                    FRED
          Let me tell you something, son.  You
          would have been great at anything.

     Something outside catches George's eye.  A light.  A
     reflection.  A movement.  George is up and on the move.

                    FRED (CONT'D)
          Where are you going?

     EXT. JUNG HOUSE - NIGHT

     The front door opens and FEDERAL AGENTS pour into the house.

     INT. JUNG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     George is up the stairs in a flash.

                    ERMINE
          George!

     INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

     George slams the door behind him, moves over to the window,
     and opens it.  Cops everywhere.  He's trapped.  Out of
     options, he folds.  He moves to the corner and sits down,
     turns on the train set.  A KNOCK on the door is heard.  FBI
     Agent, JAMES T. TROUT.

                    TROUT
          George Jung, you are under arrest.

                    FRED
          Open the door, son.

     EXT. JUNG HOUSE - LATER

     They lead George outside in handcuffs.  Ermine and Fred
     watch.

                    ERMINE
          I had no choice.

     George stops and looks at his mother, for the first time
     realizing her betrayal.

                    ERMINE (CONT'D)
          Don't look at me like that.  What was I
          supposed to do?  You're in our house.
          What, was I supposed to be an
          accomplice?

     As George is led to the police car, Ermine follows.

                    ERMINE (CONT'D)
          You don't think people know you're a
          drug dealer?  Everyone knows.  It's no
          secret.  How do you think that reflects
          on me?  Every time I go out, I'm
          humiliated.  I see the stares.  I hear
          the whispers.  How do you think that
          makes me feel?  Did you ever once stop
          and think of me?

     George's head is pushed down as he is put in the squad car.
     He looks up at his mother.

                    ERMINE (CONT'D)
          So you go to jail.  It's for your own
          good.  You need to straighten your life
          out.

     INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - 1974 - DAY

     SUPERIMPOSE:

     George is being led through a series of gated corridors.

                    GUARD
          Prisoner in.

     As he walks, he takes in the faces of the other inmates.  He
     arrives at his cell and notices he has a ROOMMATE.

                    GUARD (CONT'D)
          Prisoner in.

     The cell door opens and George steps inside.  There are books
     and papers spread out over both bunk beds.  George watches as
     his cellmate quickly clears everything off the top bunk.
     Apparently, the papers are private.  George puts his things
     down and the little man proffers his hand.  He is dark,
     polite and Colombian.

                    DIEGO DELGADO
          My name is Diego Delgado.  How do you
          do?

     INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - MESS HALL - 1974 - DAY

     George pushes his tray through the cafeteria line.  Diego is
     behind him.

                    DIEGO
          If you don't mind me asking, what is the
          reason you are in this place?

                    GEORGE
          What?

                    DIEGO
          Your offense?  Why are you here?

                    GEORGE
          I don't want to talk about it.

                    DIEGO
          Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to
          know my crime?

                    GEORGE
          Not really, no.

                    DIEGO
          No?

                    GEORGE
          I don't like a lot of conversation,
          Diego.

                    DIEGO
          Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah,
          blah is no good.  But we are roommates,
          okay?  And we must talk to each other.
          I am arrested for stealing cars.  For
          the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it
          is your turn.  Now you will tell me,
          okay?  You will tell me why you are
          here?

     George says nothing.  He keeps eating his food.

                    DIEGO (CONT'D)
          Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be
          friends, we must trust each other.

                    GEORGE
          Murder.

                    DIEGO
          Ah, yes.  The murder.

     INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT

     George lays on his bunk, smoking.  Diego is on the bottom
     bunk, furiously writing on a notepad.  He flips through his
     books and rustles his papers.  George peeks over the side to
     see what Diego is doing.

                    GEORGE
          What do you got there, Diego?

                    DIEGO
          Nothing.  Just a little project.

                    GEORGE
          What kind of project?

                    DIEGO
          Never mind.  Not for you to worry.

                    GEORGE
          I thought you said we were roommates.
          That we should talk about everything.

                    DIEGO
          You have your intrigues.  I have mine.
          This is a happy day for me, George.
          Nine months from today, I will be in
          Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine
          months, I am free.  How much time do you
          have?

                    GEORGE
          Twenty-six months.

                    DIEGO
          Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must
          be your lawyer.

                    GEORGE
          I've got to get out of here, Diego.

                    DIEGO
          Only two ways I know to leave here
          early.  One is to escape.

                    GEORGE
          What's the other one?

     INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - CLASSROOM - DAY

     George is trying to teach basic education to the inmates.
     The room, mostly black and hispanic, is hostile.  They don't
     want to learn.

                    GEORGE
          Alright, let's open our books.

                    INMATE #1
          Man, fuck you.

                    INMATE #2
          We ain't opening shit.

                    INMATE #1
          You just the warden's boy.  We on to
          you.  You just trying to knock some time
          off, asskissing motherfucker.

     Diego watches as the room reacts with laughter.  This ain't
     going to be easy.

                    GEORGE
          Alright.  You're right.  I want to get
          out of this shithole as fast as I can.
          And I don't want to do this any more
          than you do.  But for me to walk early,
          some of you have to graduate.  You,
          forget about it.  You're hopeless, go to
          sleep.

     The room laughs again.

                    INMATE #3
          Damn, homeboy, you got ruined.

                    GEORGE
          But the rest of you could get diplomas
          and get jobs when you're on the outside.

     The room looks at him.  They ain't buying it.

                    INMATE #1
          Shit, I'm in for life.

                    INMATE #2
          I'm a criminal.  I ain't getting no
          motherfucking job.

                    GEORGE
          We can learn some criminal shit, too.
          Alright, I'll make you a deal.  What if
          half the time, we learn about George
          Washington, and the other half, I'll
          teach you how to smuggle drugs?

                    INMATE #2
          Man, you don't know dick about smuggling
          no drugs.

                    GEORGE
          I was arrested in Chicago with six
          hundred and sixty pounds of grass.  I
          think that qualifies me.

     Diego looks up from his desk, suddenly very interested.

                    INMATE #1
          How did you get a hold of six-hundred
          and sixty pounds of dope?

                    GEORGE
          Flew it in from Mexico on a single
          engine Cessna.  Now, do we have a deal
          or not?

     They react.  They're in.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Alright, the first thing you need to
          know about smuggling drugs is that it's
          easy.  The DEA are a bunch of losers.
          They couldn't find their dicks in a
          whorehouse.  They don't know what the
          fuck they're doing...

     Diego watches George winning over the room.  He listens
     intently to George's every word.  His wheels are turning.

     INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT

     Lights out.  Diego and George lay in their cots.  George is
     tired.  Diego is not.

                    DIEGO
          George?  Hey, George?  I listen to what
          you say to the class today about the
          smuggling.  You are a magico, ah?

     George doesn't respond.

                    DIEGO (CONT'D)
          I never believed you were a murderer.  I
          knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have
          seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.

                    GEORGE
          I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.

                    DIEGO
          You like to make the boundaries
          disappear.  It's not only the money, is
          it, George?  The adventure is part of
          the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?

                    GEORGE
          Good night.

                    DIEGO
          In my country, I am a magico.  A man
          with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To
          take nothing and make it something,
          okay?  I have failed my dream, but I
          will accomplish.  That is why I am in
          your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom.
          But they do not take my dream.  Do you
          have a dream, George?

                    GEORGE
          I would if I could get some sleep.

                    DIEGO
          Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you
          accomplish your dream.  But yet you
          failed.  Why?

                    GEORGE
          Because I got caught.

                    DIEGO
          No, my brother.

                    GEORGE
          Because they caught me?

                    DIEGO
          You failed because you had the wrong
          dream.

     Diego climbs off his bunk and looks George square in the eye.

                    DIEGO (CONT'D)
          George?  What do you know about cocaine?

     INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - MESS HALL - DAY

                    GEORGE
          I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good
          thing going already.  Everybody smokes
          pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich
          man's drug.  It's too expensive.

                    DIEGO
          No, no.  That is where you are wrong.
          For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we
          buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN
          Miami, we sell for sixty.

     George's interest is piqued.

                    GEORGE
          That's over fifty-thousand dollars
          profit per kilo.

                    DIEGO
          And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few
          times and retail, you're looking at two,
          three-hundred thousand.

                    GEORGE
          Oh my G-d.

                    DIEGO
          Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than
          a kilo of your precious marijuana.
          Everything is the same, George, except
          instead of thousands, you are making
          millions.

                    GEORGE
          Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.

                    DIEGO
          Now do you see what I am saying?

                    GEORGE
          Getting it here is no problem.  Trust
          me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to.
          What about supply?  How much can we get?

                    DIEGO
          Don't worry.  We will talk of
          everything.  We have the time.  You
          arrive here with a Bachelor of
          Marijuana, but you will leave with a
          Doctorate of Cocaine.

     INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT

     Diego and George pouring over Diego's plans.  Discussing,
     planning, plotting.

                    DIEGO
          What type of planes do you have?

                    GEORGE
          Four passenger, single engine Cessna.

                    DIEGO
          How many kilos can we fit in these
          planes?

                    GEORGE
          I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and
          fifty.  How many miles is it from
          Colombia to Miami?

                    DIEGO
          Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop
          somewhere to refuel.

                    GEORGE
          We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know
          someone there.

                    DIEGO
          Great.  I love the Bahamas.

     EXT. LIQUOR STORE - WEYMOUTH - 1976

     SUPERIMPOSE: JULY, 1976.

     George is at a payphone.  He drops in about a million
     quarters until he is finally connected.

                    GEORGE
          Diego Delgado, please?

                    DIEGO
          Allo?

                    GEORGE
          Diego?  It's George.

                    DIEGO
          George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah?
          Are you out?

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, I'm out.

                    DIEGO
          Congratulations, brother.  I've been
          waiting for you.

                    GEORGE
          How are we doing?

                    DIEGO
          Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything
          is fine down here.  Everything is all
          set up.

                    GEORGE
          Do we need a plane?  How does this work?
          When do I see you?

                    DIEGO
          Slow down, George.  Slow down.

     Fred exits the liquor store carrying two bottles of Dom
     Perignon.  As he catches George's eye, he lifts the bottles
     showing them off.  George holds up his finger, indicating
     he'll be just a second.

                    DIEGO (CONT'D)
          You need to come down here, everybody
          meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha.
          We do one for good faith and then we
          talk about airplanes.

                    GEORGE
          I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on
          parole.  I can't leave the state.

                    DIEGO
          But you must.  It's the only way.

                    GEORGE
          I just got released five minutes ago.

                    DIEGO
          George, are we gonna do this or not?

     EXT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - POOLSIDE - 1976 - DAY

     George steps outside and spots Diego.  Their eyes meet.
     Diego looks different, relaxed.  He wears a straw hat,
     shorts, and sports a healthy tan.  The two men embrace.

                    GEORGE
          Good to see you, Diego.

                    DIEGO
          Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The
          water.  The women.  It's better than
          Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some
          friends I would like you to meet.

     EXT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - POOLSIDE - 1976 - DAY

     Diego and George sit with five other Colombians, most
     notably, a man named CESAR ROZA.  The mood is not friendly.

                    DIEGO
          Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each
          suitcase.  You receive a hundred
          thousand dollars upon delivery.

                    GEORGE
          Okay.

                    CESAR
          Not so fast.  I would like to go over
          the details.

                    GEORGE
          What details?  I put the coke in the
          false bottoms and take it through
          customs.

                    CESAR
          Tell me about the suitcases.  What is
          the make and the color?

                    DIEGO
          Samsonites.  Red.  No tags.

     Cesar thinks about it.

                    CESAR
          Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in
          the suitcase?

                    GEORGE
          What?  Yeah, sure.

                    CESAR
          Whose cloths?  Your clothes?

                    GEORGE
          My clothes, your clothes.  What does it
          matter?

                    CESAR
          I would like to know the contents.
          Every detail is important.

                    GEORGE
          What are we doing here, Diego?  This
          guy's a clown.  He's talking about
          clothes.

                    CESAR
          I demand to know everything.  I do not
          trust six-hundred thousand dollars of
          coca to someone I don't know.

                    GEORGE
          It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss
          fifteen kilos.

                    CESAR
          The coca is my responsibility!

                    GEORGE
          You're a fucking amateur!

                    DIEGO
          Gentlemen, please.  There is no need to
          be impolite.  Cesar, this will be fine.
          You have my word.  George, Cesar is just
          being thorough.  That's all.

                    CESAR
          Very well.  But just remember, Mr. Jung.
          I will be with you the whole way.  And I
          will be watching.

     INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - CUSTOMS - 1976 - DAY

     George carries the two Samsonites over to customs
     inspections.  It's a long walk.  George's heart beats hard.
     The sound is audible and grows with every beat.  BA-BUMP.  BA
     BUMP.  Cesar lurks at the baggage carousel.

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          When you're carrying drugs across the
          border, the idea is to remain calm.  The
          way I do it is to think of something
          pleasant, a fun party, a moment of
          triumph.  A sexual encounter.  I
          actually project myself to that place.
          Anything to keep your mind off the fact
          that you're going to jail for a very
          long time if they find the fifteen kilos
          of cocaine in your suitcases.

     George stands in front of the customs agent.  He tries his
     best to look relaxed as the agent reviews his documents.

                    CUSTOMS AGENT
          On vacation?

                    GEORGE
          Yes.

                    CUSTOMS AGENT
          On vacation for only one day?

     BA-BUMP.  BA-BUMP.  The heartbeats are very loud.

                    GEORGE
              (weak smile)
          My brother's wedding.  Imagine that,
          huh?

     George's breathing is labored and his swallowing reflex
     doesn't seem to be working.  Cesar passes through, eyeballing
     George the whole time.

                    CUSTOMS AGENT
          Open your bags, please.

     George opens the Samsonites.  Super dry mouth.  BA-BUMP.  BA
     BUMP.  The beats are deafening now.  Cesar nervously monitors
     the situation from the payphones.

                    CUSTOMS AGENT (CONT'D)
          Whose clothes are these?

                    GEORGE
          Mine.

     The customs agent holds up a woman's undergarment.  Cesar
     throws up his hands in frustration.

                    CUSTOMS AGENT
          And this?

                    GEORGE
          What can I tell you?  Different strokes.

     George winks at the customs agent, who shakes his head before
     finishing the inspection.

                    CUSTOMS AGENT
          Alright, go ahead.

     EXT. LOGAN AIRPORT - PAYPHONES - CONTINUOUS

     George moves to the payphones, sets down the two suitcases,
     and pretends to make a call.  Not inconspicuously, Cesar
     grabs the bags and walks quickly out of the terminal.

     INT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - 1976 - DAY

     Diego, Cesar, George and JACK STEVENS, a silver haired
     executive type, lounge around the mini-suite.  Cesar still
     has that crazy look in his eye.

                    DIEGO
          Three-hundred kilos it is, then.

     A beautiful Latin woman enters and kisses both Diego and
     Cesar.  Her name is INEZ, and friendly she is not.

                    DIEGO (CONT'D)
          Has everyone met Inez?  This is George.
          I've told you about him.  And this is
          friend, Jack Stevens.

     The men proffer their hands, but she just looks at them like
     ants before sitting down next to Diego.

                    DIEGO (CONT'D)
          Try to be more respectful, darling.  My
          apologies.  But she is mistrustful of
          Americans.  Shall we proceed?  Let's
          hear it again, Mr. Stevens.

                    STEVENS
          I'll fly down on a Friday, refuel in the
          Bahamas, and then to Medellin.

                    INEZ
          Friday?

     Inez addresses Diego and Cesar only.  She speaks in Spanish.
     The conversation is about "Why Friday?"  Inez has some
     problem with it.  Diego explains.  And Inez is reassured.

                    DIEGO
          Please, continue.

                    GEORGE
          We make the pick-up, refuel once more in
          the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with
          the mom and pop traffic.

                    CESAR
          Why are you speaking?

                    GEORGE
          Excuse me?

                    CESAR
          You.  Your responsibility is over.  You
          do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You
          are not a distributor.  You introduced
          us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his
          airplane.  That is all.  You make a
          percentage.  A generous one.  And you're
          lucky to get that.

                    GEORGE
          I see.  How much?

                    CESAR
          Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo.
          For everyone.  For you, and you, and
          you.

     He indicates George, Diego and Jack Stevens.

                    CESAR (CONT'D)
          There is no negotiation.  Three-million
          dollars.  That is all.

                    STEVENS
          I want two.

                    GEORGE
          Gee, Jack, a million each had such a
          nice ring to it.

                    STEVENS
          No way.  I'm doing all the work.  Taking
          all the risk, and it's my plane.

     Diego and George look at each other.

                    STEVENS (CONT'D)
          Hey, you guys don't have to do shit.
          Just sit back and collect your money.

                    GEORGE
          You good with this?

     Diego nods.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Alright.

     This is too much for Inez to handle.  She starts screaming
     machine gun Spanish.  Something about a "lousy two-hundred
     and fifty-thousand dollars," and how Diego is "such a coward"
     to give away all his money.  Diego is embarrassed but tries
     to remain calm.

                    DIEGO
          You will watch what you say.  Especially
          around George.  He is my brother and he
          speaks as good Spanish as you.

     But Inez is wild.  She starts in again, a log of "Putos
     (SOB's)", and "Cojones" and "Maricones (gay/sissys)."  Even
     Cesar is uncomfortable.  Diego stands.

                    DIEGO (CONT'D)
          Okay.  That's enough.

                    INEZ
          Get your hands off me.

     Inez takes a swing at Diego and catches him full across the
     face.  Time stops in the room.  Question.  What will Diego
     do?  Answer: SMACK!  Diego swings back and a full scale is
     on.  Cesar continues the conversation.  It's surreal.  As if
     Diego and Inez weren't beating the shit out of each other
     right in front of them.

                    CESAR
          Do you have pictures of your kids?

                    STEVENS
          What?

                    CESAR
          I'll need to see them.  Also need their
          names and the names of their schools.
          We are trusting you with ninety million
          dollars worth of coca, Mr. Stevens.
          Without your children, there is no deal.

     Stevens thinks about it.  Kids as collateral.  Inez and Diego
     are still duking it out.  But Diego finally gets the upper
     hand and drags her into the bedroom.

                    STEVENS
          Fine.  So if that's all, I'll be leaving
          now.

     Cesar walks him to the door.

                    CESAR
          Don't forget the pictures.

     Diego calls from the other room.

                    DIEGO (O.S.)
          George.  George, come in here.


     INT. LA BELLE MER - BEDROOM - LATER

     Diego has put Inez in the bathroom and is holding the door
     closed.  She pounds and kicks and screams in frustration, but
     he pays no attention.

                    DIEGO
          What's the matter, George?

                    GEORGE
          What's the matter?  We're moving three
          hundred fucking kilos and we're making
          dogshit.

                    DIEGO
          A million dollars for our first run is
          not bad, George.

                    GEORGE
          It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might
          as well be hauling suitcases across the
          border.  We're getting screwed.

                    DIEGO
          I know.

                    GEORGE
          And what happens when these guys stop
          paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are
          going to cut us out.  Then where are we?

                    DIEGO
          That's my George, always thinking.

     The door is yanked open to reveal Inez.  She is in a rage.
     Diego slams it in her face.

                    DIEGO (CONT'D)
          This is only part of the business,
          George.  A very small part.  Don't
          worry, there is so much more to do.
          Which reminds me, I need a favor from
          you.  I must go to Colombia.

                    GEORGE
          What is it, George?  Because I have to
          get home.  I've got a parole officer
          waiting for me.

                    DIEGO
          I need you to go to Miami.

     EXT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - MIAMI - 1977 - DAY

     George gets out of a taxi to find SEVERAL COLOMBIAN MEN
     hanging around outside an apartment.  He checks the address
     and moves over to the men.

                    GEORGE
          I'm George.  Friend of Diego's?

     The Colombian men are not impressed.  They grab George and
     pull him inside.

     INT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - CONTINUOUS

     George is pinned against the wall and the Colombian men all
     start screaming at him in Spanish.  There seems to be a
     problem.  A man, ALESSANDRO, steps forward.  He is the one
     who speaks English.

                    ALESSANDRO
          QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?

                    GEORGE
          I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.

                    ALESSANDRO
          Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains
          everything.  Open your mouth, George.

     George's puzzled look is replaced by a gun barrel in his
     face.  Alessandro presses it against George's front teeth.

                    ALESSANDRO (CONT'D)
          Now, you listen to me.  Are you hearing
          me?

     George nods.

                    ALESSANDRO (CONT'D)
          You see this?

     He indicates two duffel bags stuffed with fifty kilos of
     cocaine.

                    ALESSANDRO (CONT'D)
          I've been holding this shit for him for
          three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't
          appreciate it.  You tell him I want my
          money by Friday.  Can you do that?

                    GEORGE
          Um-hmm.

     INT. JUNG HOUSE - GEORGE'S ROOM - DAY

     George sits on his bed, reading.  Two duffel bags are tucked
     away in the closet.  Ermine pokes her head in.

                    ERMINE
          You have a phone call.

     George picks up the phone.

                    DIEGO (O.S.)
          George.

                    GEORGE
          Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you?
          It's been eleven days and these guys
          want their fucking money.

                    DIEGO (O.S.)
          Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.

                    GEORGE
          Well, you better get here fast.  I'm
          sitting on...

     George notices Ermine is loitering in the hallway,
     eavesdropping.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Hi, Mom.

     George acknowledges her before shutting the door in her face.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I'm sitting on fifty fucking keys.  Get
          your ass up here.

     INT. CARCEL DE VARONES - MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA - CONTINUOUS

     It's a South American prison.  Diego is on the pay phone.

                    DIEGO
          It's a little hard to get away right
          now.  I'm afraid you're on your own.

     INT. FOREAL'S HOUSE - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT

     George and Derek sit in the living room with MR. T, a hippie
     ish looking professor.  On the table sits various
     paraphernalia.  Scales, beakers, test tubes, and a hot box.
     George and Derek watch as Mr. T scoops some of George's
     cocaine and sets it onto the two-inch metal plate.

                    MR. T
          What we're doing is measuring the
          purity.  Pure coke melts out a hundred
          and eighty-five, a hundred and ninety
          degrees.  Cutting agents melt much
          lower.  About a hundred degrees.
          Quality product starts melting at a
          hundred and forty degrees.  That's what
          I'm hoping for.

     Mr. T turns the dial.  120.  130.  140.

                    MR. T (CONT'D)
          Good.

     150.  160.

                    MR. T (CONT'D)
          Jesus Christ.

     170.  180.

                    MR. T (CONT'D)
          Holy fucking Mary!  Jesus, fuck me
          running!  Where did you get this shit!

     At one-hundred and eighty-seven degrees, the white powder
     dribbles off the hotplate and melts away.

                    MR. T (CONT'D)
          Damn!  Can I do a fucking line?!

     Mr. T puts his nose in the powder.  George pulls Foreal
     aside.

                    GEORGE
          What did I tell you?

                    DEREK
          It's great and everything, but what am I
          going to do with all this?

                    GEORGE
          Sell it?

                    DIEGO
          Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in
          two years, and you show up at my door
          with a hundred and ten pounds of
          cocaine?

                    GEORGE
          Just sell it, Derek.

                    DEREK
          Alright, but it's gonna take me a year.

     INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT

     Money everywhere.  All over the floor, the counters, the
     chairs, and even in the sinks.  George and Derek count the
     money patiently, writing the dollar amount in yellow high
     lighter on the top of each stack, before wrapping it with a
     rubber band.

                    DIEGO
          Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it.
          Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.

                    GEORGE
          I think it's fair to say you
          underestimated the market there, Derek.

                    DIEGO
          Touche.

                    GEORGE
          But to the victor belong the spoils.

     George divides the money.  There's a hell of a lot.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Half a million for you.  Half a million
          for me.  One-point-three five for the
          Colombians.

                    DEREK
          Nice doing business with you, George.

                    GEORGE
          Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?

     INT. AIRPORT - MIAMI - DAY

     Immaculate in his white turtleneck and sunglasses, George
     walks with two aluminum cases.  He is greeted by Alessandro
     and his thugs.

                    ALESSANDRO
          Greetings, Mr. George.

                    GEORGE
          Where do you guys want to count?

                    ALESSANDRO
          On the plane.

                    GEORGE
          What plane?  We going someplace?  Where
          we headed?  You have your money.  It's
          all there.  What the fuck is going on?

     They usher him away.

     The blazer pulls into a long driveway.  They approach a gate
     where SHIRTLESS TEENAGERS with MAC-10's stand guard.  The
     gate opens.  YOUNG SOLDIERS open the door for George and
     roughly usher him over to a Jeep within the confine.  They
     frisk him top to bottom.  Diego is leaning against another
     Jeep and waits for George to be released.

                    DIEGO
          George, good to see you, my brother.

                    GEORGE
          What the fuck is going on?  When did you
          get out of jail?

                    DIEGO
          Pablo used his influence.  Now, George,
          watch what you say.  Everybody hears
          everything.  A lot of things get said
          and done that, well, let's just say this
          isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you
          know?  No offense, but you know what I'm
          saying?

                    GEORGE
          Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do
          the talking.

                    DIEGO
          Right.  Now who is the person in
          California?  The connection?

                    GEORGE
          Just a friend.

                    DIEGO
          Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind.
          We'll talk about it later.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah.  You do the talking.

     The sound of a young man, a MALETON, struggling can be heard
     in the distance.  From another area, PABLO ESCOBAR emerges.
     He is singular in purpose.  He is handed a pistol and moves
     quickly over to the man and quietly speaks a few words.  And
     then, without emotion, he shoots the maleton in the head.
     George and Diego, who is visibly shaken, watch.  Escobar is
     handed a towel, and he wipes the splattered blood off his
     hands, as he moves back.

                    LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
          He will see you now.
              (to Diego)
          Not you.

                    DIEGO
          There must be some kind of mistake.

                    LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
          No mistake.  Mr. Escobar will see Mr.
          Jung alone.  You are to wait here.

     George hesitates.

                    DIEGO
          It's alright, George.  You go.

                    LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
          This way, please.

     The large Colombian man escorts George towards the area where
     the maleton was just shot.  George looks back at Diego as he
     is led away.

                    ESCOBAR
          So, this is the man who takes fifty
          kilos and makes them disappear in one
          day?

                    GEORGE
          Actually, it was three.

                    ESCOBAR
          The man who gives us the airplanes.  The
          man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago.
          Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to
          open for us the gates of Hollywood,
          George?

                    GEORGE
          It would be my pleasure.

                    ESCOBAR
          Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend.
          Welcome to my country.

     Escobar moves over to embrace George.  George returns it, and
     their hands come together.  George can't help it.  He
     reflexively looks at his hands.  Escobar understands.

                    ESCOBAR (CONT'D)
          The man in the garden.  He was full of
          courage.

                    GEORGE
          Un sapo?

                    ESCOBAR
          Un rata - no good.  But he could have
          run, fled the country.  Gone to the
          policia.  But then his wife, his
          children, his parents, his friends, many
          people would die.

                    GEORGE
          Yes.

                    ESCOBAR
          But, never mind.  I am thinking we can
          do much together.  This problem with
          Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very
          silly business.  To release him from the
          carcel, it causes me much inconvenience.
          The fifty kilos could have been a big
          problem.  And I don't like problems.

                    GEORGE
          With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my
          partner.  I do not do business without
          him.

     Escobar looks at him with a cold stare.  But George doesn't
     flinch.  His face reveals nothing.  Finally, a smile breaks
     across Pablo's lips.

                    ESCOBAR
          I like you, George.  You are loyal.
          That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe
          crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You
          are like me.  I look at you and I see
          myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?

                    GEORGE
          Yes, it is.

                    ESCOBAR
          So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine
          for me in your country, George?

                    GEORGE
          Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.

                    ESCOBAR
          As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very
          good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let
          us drive.  We have much to talk about.

     Diego watches the two men walk outside.  Escobar throws an
     arm around George's shoulder.  Pablo hops into a Jeep and
     motions for George.  The bodyguards come running.  But Pablo
     waves them away.

     EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - COLOMBIA - DAY

     Escobar pulls the Jeep off the road and parks it.  Before
     them is a stunning panorama.

                    ESCOBAR
          I like to come up here.  To make the
          decisions.  To be one with nature.

                    GEORGE
          It's beautiful.

                    ESCOBAR
          People tell me that I am crazy.  That my
          business will never work in your
          country.  What do you think, George?

     Escobar looks out over the vista, allowing George the time to
     respond in full.

                    GEORGE
          What do I think?  I don't want my answer
          to be influenced by what I want, so I'm
          going to have to say I don't know.

                    ESCOBAR
          Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do
          you want, George?

                    GEORGE
          I want money.

                    ESCOBAR
          Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?

                    GEORGE
          Freedom.

                    ESCOBAR
          Power?

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, maybe.

                    ESCOBAR
          Family.

                    GEORGE
          Sure.

                    ESCOBAR
          Beautiful girls?

                    GEORGE
          Keep them coming.

                    ESCOBAR
          Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You
          are right.  But money.

                    GEORGE
          Money.

                    ESCOBAR
          And Diego?

                    GEORGE
          Diego is my brother.

     Escobar looks at George a long time.  He's inscrutable.

                    ESCOBAR
          Good.  Take care of him, George.  I'm
          fond of him, but he is sometimes like a
          baby.  Keep an eye on him, okay?

     EXT. DESERTED SUGAR FACTORY - ENTRANCE - DAY

     Diego is a little pissed off for being left for so long.  He
     taps his foot and picks at his fingernails.  Escobar and
     George pull up in the Jeep.  Diego leaps to his feet.

                    DIEGO
          Padrino.

     Escobar wraps his arms around Diego in an embrace.

                    ESCOBAR
          Diego, mijo.  I've made a decision.  We
          are going into business and I would like
          to start right away.

     The following images are overlaid with snow falling and money

     the phone, wheeling and dealing, hands counting cash, and
     lines being drawn off mirrors.  The effect is surreal and
     dreamy.

     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

     A duffel bag is unzipped, revealing bricks and bricks of
     cocaine.  Each marked with a "P."  A knife punctures one of
     the bricks.  A mound of white powder is brought up to a man's
     nose.  It's George who samples, and then it is sampled by the
     man he is doing business with.  The shot widens TO REVEAL all
     the participants and dozens and dozens of duffel bags.  A
     handshake seals the deal.

     George and Diego count.  It's ridiculous how much money there
     is.  The stacks are now waist high and spill into other
     rooms.  Inez is there, pacing the floor and rapid-fire
     talking on the phone.

     George and Diego, the Banditos.  Cigars.  Champagne.  Arms

     With Inez, sunning on a yacht.  More coke and more
     transactions.  When the deals are with Derek Foreal, Diego is
     always notably absent.

     INT. MIAMI HOUSE - NIGHT

     The money is so high, it almost reaches the ceiling.  There
     is nowhere to put it.  George and Diego sit at the coffee
     table, dwarfed by the stacks of bills.  There is a
     discrepancy in the count.

                    GEORGE
          Three million.  I counted it twice.

                    DIEGO
          It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.

     George starts to pick up the money.

                    GEORGE
          I'm calling it three.

                    DIEGO
          We're half a million off.

                    GEORGE
          Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.

                    DIEGO
          Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's
          three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point
          five.

                    GEORGE
          I don't give a shit.  Close enough.

     George moves down the hall looking for a place to stack the
     money, but there is no more room.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Where do I put this!?

                    DIEGO
          Try the back bedroom.

     George opens the back bedroom door to find wall-to-wall
     money.  It's packed.

                    GEORGE
          There's no room.

                    DIEGO
          Try the closet.

     No luck there, either.  George drops the money on the floor
     and moves back into the living room.

                    GEORGE
          We've got to do something about this.

     Panamanian officials and the BANK PRESIDENT oversee the
     proceedings.

                    GEORGE
          Are you comfortable with this?

                    DIEGO
          George, we've got sixty-one million
          dollars.  It's either here or someplace
          else.  We've got to put it somewhere.
          Unless you want to launder it.

                    GEORGE
          And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.

                    DIEGO
          Then relax.  It's a federal bank.
          Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor
          Noriega has very lenient banking
          principles.  No questions.  No problems.
          All the pesados keep their money here.
          Even El Padrino.  What do you worry?
          Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who
          is going to fuck with us?

     INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY

     George and Diego sign papers.  The bank president
     congratulates them and hands them documentation.

                    GEORGE
          I love it.

                    BANK PRESIDENT
          I'm sorry.

                    GEORGE
          I give you thirty-million dollars and
          you give me this little book.

     best man, and the only American.

     INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

     A huge reception.  All the pomp and circumstance Colombian
     money can buy.  Politicians.  Policemen.  And every smuggler
     north of Colombia.  George sits with Diego and Inez at the
     table of honor.  Inez is opening presents.  Diego's tipsiness
     is a little out of character, but hey, it's his wedding day
     and a little champagne never hurt anyone.  He drunkenly
     throws his arm around George's shoulder.

                    DIEGO
          I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't
          believe it.  Can you believe I'm
          married, George?

                    GEORGE
          You're a lucky man, Diego.

                    DIEGO
          I love you, my brother, do you know
          that?

                    GEORGE
          I love you too, man.

     George notices MIRTHA showing teeth across the room.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I'll be right back, Diego.

          Look, honey, a power boat.

                    DIEGO
          Great, baby, great!

     They kiss.  George walks across the dance floor directly
     towards Mirtha.

                    GEORGE
          Hello.

                    MIRTHA
          Hello.

                    GEORGE
          Do I know you?

                    MIRTHA
          I don't think so.

                    GEORGE
          Why are you smiling?

                    MIRTHA
          Why are you smiling?

                    GEORGE
          I don't know.  My name is George.

                    MIRTHA
          I know who you are, El Americano.
          Mister George.

                    GEORGE
          What is your name?

     Cesar arrives.

                    CESAR
          Mr. Jung, I see you've met my fiancee,
          Mirtha.

     He kisses her.

                    GEORGE
          Mirtha.

                    CESAR
          Diego needs to see you right away,
          please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.

     They leave.  George looks back, Mirtha is giving him more
     teeth.  George arrives at the table.  Various greetings.

                    AUGUSTO
          Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I
          am Augusto Oliveras.

                    GEORGE
          My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me
          much about you.

                    RAMON OCHOA
          Congratulations on your conquest of the
          West Coast.   How much bigger can we
          get?

                    GEORGE
          Sky's the limit.  We're just beginning
          to tap the market.  If it's accepted by
          actors and musicians, the rest will
          follow.

     They all agree.  Mirtha still gives George the teeth from
     across the room.  Diego returns to the table.

                    AUGUSTO
          We are talking about George's West Coast
          operation.

                    DIEGO
          Ah, George's mystery man.

                    RAFAEL OJEDA
          Yes, where is this man?  When do we meet
          him?

                    DIEGO
          You don't meet him.  George keeps this a
          secret.  He's here meeting everyone,
          goes to Colombia and meets Pablo, but
          still keeps his secrets.  Even from his
          brother.

                    JUAN CARLOS "THE GUAPO"
          Come on, George, we're all in this
          together.

                    EMILIO OCHOA
          Yes, George, there's enough for
          everybody.

                    GEORGE
          I think Padroni is happy with the
          current situation.  Will you please
          excuse me?

     George exits after Mirtha.

     INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

     George steps into the empty lobby looking for Mirtha.  He
     can't find her.  She appears from the shadows and startles
     him.  George embraces her and plants one on her.

                    MIRTHA
          You better know what you're doing,
          George.  You're playing with fire.

                    GEORGE
          I like fire.

     EXT. MIAMI DRAG - DAY

     A stretch limo flies by, left to right.  The windows are open
     and Mirtha and George whoop it up as they go by.

     INT. MIAMI NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

     George and Mirtha out on the crowded dance floor, grooving to
     the Salsa rhythms.

     STILL PHOTOS

     Champagne bottles in hand, George and Mirtha on the tarmac
     running from the limo to the waiting private plane.

     EXT. FIVE STAR HOTEL - LOS ANGELES - DAY

     George and Mirtha poolside, wearing shades, getting some sun.
     She blows him a kiss from the adjoining lounge chair.  He
     blows one back.  She licks her lips and it's on.  He's out of
     the chair, pouring champagne over her tan body, and licking
     it off.  She squeals with delight.
     A table gets knocked over as they cause a commotion.  A hotel
     manager comes over, but George hands him a wad of cash and he
     quickly fucks off.

     INT. MIAMI NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT - MAGICAL REALITY

     The dancing is in SUPER SLOW MOTION now.  Passionate, carnal,
     intimate.

     STILL PHOTOS

     George buys gifts for Mirtha and she shows them off for the
     camera.  A fur.  A ring.  A house.

     INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DAY

     Overhead shot of George and Mirtha's bedroom.  It's
     completely covered with money.  Completely covered.  George
     and Mirtha make love on the sea of cash.  As CAMERA PULLS UP
     we see money slowly falling from the ceiling.

     INT. SILVER STAR WEDDING CHAPEL - LAS VEGAS - 1978 - DAY

     There is no white dress.  There is no tuxedo.  George and
     Mirtha haven't even taken off their sunglasses.

                    MIRTHA
          I do.

     They kiss.  Mirtha wipes her red nose.

                    MIRTHA (CONT'D)
          I need a fucking drink.

     INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     George moves to the bedroom.  Mirtha is pregnant and she's
     showing.  She's also bent over a mirror with a straw in her
     hand.  George opens the door and takes her by surprise.

                    GEORGE
          Jesus Christ.

                    MIRTHA
          Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite.
          I quit smoking, didn't I?

                    GEORGE
          Put that shit away, they're here.

     INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - LATER

     Mirtha and George lead Fred and Ermine from room to room,
     showing off the house.  The decor is, well, eclectic.  It
     doesn't match the architecture.

                    ERMINE
          It's all so beautiful.

                    MIRTHA
          What do you think, Dad?

                    FRED
          Yeah.  Nice.

                    ERMINE
          Look at this credenza.  If you don't
          mind me asking, how much is something
          like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.

                    GEORGE
              (quickly)
          It's a family heirloom.

                    ERMINE
          I've seen those in magazines.  They're
          not cheap.

                    GEORGE
          Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.

                    ERMINE
          Oh, I see.

                    MIRTHA
          Come on.  I'll show you the rest of the
          house.

     George and his father move outside.

     EXT. GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

     George and his father walk.

                    GEORGE
          So, business is going good.  I've got
          this import/export thing going on in
          Miami that's been very profitable.  With
          my investments...

                    FRED
          Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see
          you very much, I don't want to waste the
          time.

     They move along the rear of the house.  Classic cars line the
     driveway.

                    FRED (CONT'D)
          You come from my body, remember?  You're
          my baby boy.  The same kid who would
          jump off a mountain if someone told him
          he couldn't do it.  You haven't changed
          much.  I know the things you do.  Not
          everything.  But I get the picture and I
          don't care.  I don't like it.  It's not
          what I would have chosen for you, but
          it's your life.  It doesn't have
          anything to do with me.

     He turns and looks at his boy.

                    FRED (CONT'D)
          You're like your mother.  You love
          money.

                    GEORGE
          Dad.

                    FRED
          No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's
          good if it makes you happy.  It's nice
          to have nice things.  Are you happy,
          son?

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.

     INT. HOLIDAY MOTEL - LITTLE HAVANA - 1978 - DAY

     Diego puts a straw in his nose and snorts a big gakker.  His
     eyes are wide, his pupils dilated, and a weapon sticks out of
     the back of his pants.  He knocks the dust off his nose
     before moving outside.  George is on the porch, smoking a
     cigarette.

                    DIEGO
          Three years.  How long have we been in
          business?  Three years.  Does she get to
          meet your connection?  Was she good
          enough?

                    GEORGE
          Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be
          here any minute.  I'm trying to
          concentrate.

                    DIEGO
          I'm very angry with you, George.  Very
          angry.  You don't take me to California,
          but you take your bitch wife?  A woman?
          I understand you love her, but it was
          you and me who started this.  You and
          me.

                    GEORGE
          What do you need my connection for,
          Diego?  What are you going to do with
          it?

                    DIEGO
          What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's
          for peace of mind.  It's for the
          principle.

     George doesn't have time for this.  He checks the cylinders
     on his weapon and runs over possible scenarios in his mind.
     But Diego won't get off the soap box.

                    GEORGE
          Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't
          telling you.  It's just business.  Now,
          shut up.  You're driving me crazy.

                    DIEGO
          I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're
          driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What
          happened to our dream?

     A black sedan pulls up and FIVE PUERTO RICAN MEN approach the
     room.  George and Diego greet them and lead them inside.
     It's game time.  The atmosphere is charged with danger and
     everyone is acutely aware of everything.  The guys sit down,
     their guns bulging through the inside of their suits.  The
     suitcases are opened.  The rules are the same.  No English.
     No raising voices.  No sudden movements.  George offers their
     leader, TONY, beers for his men, and is politely declined.
     The count starts.  George and Diego riff through ten thousand
     dollar bundles.  Diego is still acting pissy.  He's mumbling
     to himself, making faces, slamming the money all around.  The
     guys keep a close eye on him.  Diego finishes a stack, throws
     one of the bags on the ground.  The conversation is in
     Spanish unless otherwise indicated.

                    TONY
          Algun problema?

                    GEORGE
          No no no... no problema, amigo.  El
          dinero esta todo aqui.
          Lleves las "llaves" y mas tarde lo
          contaremos.  Okay?  No problem.

                    TONY
          Que problema?  Nosotros esperamos.

     The pressure is getting to one of the hoods.  His name is
     BENNY.  He's got a crazy eye and he seems ready to snap.
     George resumes the count, but Diego won't get off it.

                    DIEGO
              (English)
          You embarrassed me, George.  You make me
          look very bad.

                    BENNY
          Que esta diciendo?

                    GEORGE
          Nothing.  Todo esta bien.

                    DIEGO
              (English)
          Everything is not alright.  I bring you
          in, and you slap my fucking face!

                    GEORGE
          This is not the time, Diego.

     The men all reach for their pieces and all hell starts to
     break loose.

                    TONY
          Hay algun problema?  Hablame!

                    DIEGO
              (English)
          You fucked me in front of my whole
          family!

                    GEORGE
          Fuck you...I didn't fuck you.

                    BENNY
          Maldita sea, que diablos esta diciendo?

                    GEORGE
          Esta todo aqui, amigo...take the keys.
          Take 'em and go.

                    TONY
          Que esta pasando aqui, jefe?

                    DIEGO
          Sientese ye no se meta en lo que no le
          importa.

     The guns are out and pointed.  It's out of control now.

                    GEORGE
          Take it easy!  Everything's okay!

                    DIEGO
          Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas
          campesinos?

     George steps forward with the keys.

                    GEORGE
          Take the fucking keys!

     BLAM!  Courtesy of Benny, George is hit.  The shoulder, the
     collarbone.  It's hard to tell.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is
          alright.  There's no problem.  Okay?
          This never happened.  No one has to know
          anything about this.  Diego, I want you
          to calmly tell them where the fucking
          coke is.  Do it now.

                    DIEGO
          Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.

     Tony very carefully takes the car keys.

                    GEORGE
          No problem, gentlemen.  Goodbye.

     The men slowly back out the door.  George looks at Diego.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Derek Foreal.

                    DIEGO
          What?

                    GEORGE
          Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek
          fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to
          all your dreams.  Are you happy now?

     EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

     George and Diego exit the terminal.  George's arm is in a
     sling.  The familiar sight of Derek Foreal is Lincoln
     Continental.

     The three men come together, and Diego and Derek are
     introduced.  The men's hands come together and the FRAME
     FREEZES on their handshake.

     EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

     Fred pulls into the driveway in his new car and honks the
     horn.  Fred and Ermine get out of the car.

                    FRED
          Hello, hello.

     INT. OLIVEROS MANSION - MIAMI - NIGHT

     It's a New Year's Eve party.  A lavish Colombian celebration.
     George and a very pregnant Mirtha move through the crowd to
     find Augusto.

                    AUGUSTO
          I'm so glad you two could make it.
          Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You
          look like you're about to burst.

                    MIRTHA
          Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?

                    AUGUSTO
          I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the
          bar.  And if you find her, tell her to
          come, it's almost midnight.

     As Mirtha leaves, Augusto throws his arm around George's
     shoulder.

                    AUGUSTO (CONT'D)
          It's good you came down, George.  We
          need to discuss a few things.

                    DIEGO
          Where's Diego?

                    AUGUSTO
          He's not here, George.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, well where is he?  And who is this
          Norman K. guy?  That's all anyone is
          talking about.  Norman K.  Norman K.  Do
          I know him?

     Augusto lets out a big laugh.

                    AUGUSTO
          Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an
          island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From
          what they say, it is free and it's
          Diego's new home.

                    GEORGE
          What?

     Augusto throws an arm around George's shoulder.

                    AUGUSTO
          Let us walk.  From what I understand,
          Diego has bought a hundred and sixty
          acres, a marina, a hotel, and an
          airstrip.

                    GEORGE
          Motherfucker works fast.

                    AUGUSTO
          The word is that soon he is to be king
          of the middle empire.  He is doing
          multiple runs right now and using the
          island as a jump-off point.

                    GEORGE
          He what?

                    AUGUSTO
          Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very
          busy man.  Along with many others.  You
          shouldn't stay away so long.

                    GEORGE
          That's impossible.  We can't be up and
          running.  Who's distributing?

     Augusto says nothing.  But the ball is dropping in Times
     Square.  10, 9, 8, 7...

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Oh, no.

     Happy New Year.  Streamers, confetti, and champagne.  George
     marches through the kissing guests and over to a phone.  He's
     steaming.  The music is up, so he has to scream.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Hello, Derek?  This is George.  Am I
          wearing lipstick?
          I said, am I wearing lipstick?  Because
          when I'm getting fucked, I want to make
          sure my face is pretty.  You're buying
          directly from Diego, aren't you, you son
          of a bitch?

     INTERCUT

     Derek Foreal in full New Year's regalia, complete with party
     hat.

                    DEREK
          I don't want to get caught in the middle
          of this.  That's between you and Diego.

     George's face scrinches in pain.

                    DEREK (CONT'D)
          It's nothing personal, George.  Just
          business.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah.  I understand.  Just business.
          Right.  Fuck you.

     The song ends, and George is left standing there screaming.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I bring you in, and this is how you
          repay me?  You little homo!  Hey, Derek?
          Derek?

     INT. OLIVEROS MANSION - DINING ROOM - 1979 - LATER

     It's late.  The family is all there.  Fifteen, twenty strong.
     Cuban coffees all around.

                    MIRTHA
          Que va hacer?

                    AUGUSTO
          Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va
          hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.

                    MARIA
          Alguna cosa tiene que hacer.

                    FAMILY MEMBER #2
          De otra manera, es un marica.

                    FAMILY MEMBER #3
          Un hijueputa

                    FAMILY MEMBER #1
          Maricon.

                    FAMILY MEMBER #2
          Mira, vos sos responsable por el exito
          de Diego.

                    FAMILY MEMBER #3
          El se esta burlando de vos.  Debes hacer
          algo, hombre.

                    MARIA
          No Puedes hacer ni un culo.

                    AUGUSTO
          El no va hacer nada.  Hay un problema.
          Aqui, hubo un error y nosotros lo vamos
          ha arreglar.

                    BLANCA
          No le escusches a mi yerno.  A el solo
          le importa la plata.

     Blanca reaches into her purse, pulls out an ice pick folded
     in a piece of linen cloth, and puts it down in front of
     George.

                    BLANCA (CONT'D)
          Vos lo tenes que matar, ahorita mismo.
          De lo contrario vas a quedar como un
          marica sin horror.

                    FAMILY MEMBER #3
          Mejor dicho vos sos un aculillado.

          Maricon.

                    BLANCA
          Sabes que, vos no tenes pantalones.
          Nadie te va a respetar.  Usa esto.  Deja
          solo un huequito tan pequeno, que ni
          sangre le va a salir a ese malparido del
          Diego.

                    AUGUSTO
          Blanca, por favor.

                    MIRTHA
          Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va
          a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su
          tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta.
          El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar,
          le va a hechar un hijueputa carro
          encima.

                    AUGUSTO
          Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan!
          Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George,
          debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica
          manera, mano.

                    GEORGE
          No, no, no, no yo puedo arregarlo solo.

     EXT. NORMAN CAY - BAHAMAS - 1979 - DUSK

     George cruises through the turqoise water of the Caribbean in
     a sport fisherman.  Before him is Norman Cay.  White sand
     beaches.  Beautiful.  Pristine.

     EXT. NORMAN CAY - DOCKS - DUSK

     Waiting for him is Cesar.

                    CESAR
          Good to see you, George.  It's been a
          long time.

     INT. THE YACHT CLUB - SUNSET

     The Yacht Club is a tavern style bar that juts out over the
     water.  The crimson sky streaks the windows.  Diego looks
     like Che Guavera.  His hair is long, and a graying beard
     sticks through his gaunt face.  The bar has been taken over
     by Diego's BANDITOS.  Automatic weapons and PROSTITUTES
     accent this drunken setting.  George is escorted through the
     door by Cesar, and the room quiets.  All eyes on Diego and
     George.  Diego rises.

                    DIEGO
          George, I am happy to see you.  How are
          you, my brother?

                    GEORGE
          No more brothers, Diego.

                    DIEGO
          Of course we are brothers.  Why do you
          say that?   You hurt me, George.

                    GEORGE
          You fucked me, Diego.

                    DIEGO
          I did not.

                    GEORGE
          You went behind my back and you cut me
          out.

                    DIEGO
          No, I never.  I would not do that,
          George.  Never.

                    GEORGE
          I talked to Foreal, Diego.

     There is a pause.  Diego's goons ready their weapons as Diego
     scoops up a cringer with his pinky and sniffs.

                    DIEGO
          Maybe you are right.  I did betray you a
          little bit.

     One of the men says something in Spanish and everyone laughs.
     George is furious.  He starts to tremble and his face turns
     red.

                    DIEGO (CONT'D)
          Oh, boo hoo, boo hoo.  So sad, George.
          I stole your California connection.  So
          what?  Who introduced you to Pablo
          Escobar?  Me.  Who introduced you to
          your fucking Colombian wife?  Me.  Who
          protected you when my friend Cesar Roza
          wanted to slice your fucking throat,
          huh?  Who mad you millions and millions
          of dollars?  Me.  And what do I get in
          return?  This?  Accusations?  I have
          always given you everything, George, but
          that is over now.  This is my operation.
          My dream.  So go home, George.  Go back
          to your stupid little life.  You can
          sell half grams to your fucking
          relatives for all I care.  Because you
          are out!

     George lunges at Diego and is immediately grabbed.

                    GEORGE
          You'd better kill me now, Diego, because
          you're a dead man.

                    DIEGO
          George, don't be so emotional.  This is
          business.  Besides, I can't kill you,
          you are my brother.

     They lead him away.

     EXT. YACHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS

     George is getting the shit kicked out of him.  His teeth
     broken, kicked in the head, the body, the groin.  His arm
     stomped.  Blood and broken bones.  It's a king size beating.
     The men prop him up and Cesar reaches back and hits him with
     a haymaker.  CRACK.  George's nose is broken.  Blood spurts
     everywhere.  George is dropped to the ground, spit on, and
     left for dead.

                    CESAR
          Say "hi" to your pretty wife for me.

     EXT. HACIENDA LOS NAPOLES - COLOMBIA - POOL - DAY

     A beautiful, sprawling estate.  A family barbecue, Colombian
     style, is in full swing.  Kids play soccer.  Zoo animals run
     wild together.

     George is led outside by TWO OVER-ARMED BODYGUARDS.  Pablo
     sees him and gives George a big hug.

                    ESCOBAR
          George, you look terrible.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, well...

                    ESCOBAR
          Diego?

                    GEORGE
          Yeah.

                    ESCOBAR
          Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some
          scotch.

                    GEORGE
          I didn't come here to drink scotch.

                    ESCOBAR
          I see.  I'm sorry about this, George.
          I'm not happy about this situation.
          It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus
          is.

                    GEORGE
          You know why I'm here.  You know what I
          have to do.  I came here for permission.
          Out of respect, Pablo.  This is
          bullshit, he's making me look like a
          punk.

                    ESCOBAR
          It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a
          lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the
          money.  You were an excellent teacher,
          George.  When the student has learned
          well, the teacher is no longer
          necessary.  We must remember we have
          wives, friends, familia.  Even familia
          that has not been born.  But sometimes,
          we must forget as well.  I am like you.
          I must teach the lesson.  We want to
          teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We
          must remember that life is the teacher.

                    GEORGE
          You're saying life will take care of
          Diego?

                    ESCOBAR
          Life will take care of everybody.
          Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.

                    GEORGE
          I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo.
          You know the DEA knows about Norman's
          Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships
          Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's
          fucked up!

                    ESCOBAR
          I'm sorry, George.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You
          and me, Pablo?  Are we good?

                    ESCOBAR
          Of course, George.  We are beautiful.
          We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not
          like Diego.  We started this, George.

     Escobar embraces George for a moment, and then George starts
     to move away.

                    ESCOBAR (CONT'D)
          And, George?  The vengance?  It is best
          served cold.

     INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Mirtha is sleeping.  She's so big, she looks like she's gonna
     explode.  George sits on the bed and rests his hand on
     Mirtha's face.  He looks like the Elephant Man.

                    MIRTHA
          George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look
          at you.

                    GEORGE
          Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright.
          It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm
          out.

                    MIRTHA
          Pablo said no?

                    GEORGE
          Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm
          never going back.  I have you.  We have
          the baby.  And there's nothing else.
          It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep
          now.

     EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DAY

     Fred, Ermine and Mirth are waiting for George in the car.
     Mirtha's water has broken.  Ermine honks the horn from the
     back seat and screams out the window.

                    ERMINE
          George, it's time!  George!  George!

     INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

     George is high and in a panic.  He races around, trying to
     get a suitcase packed and find his keys.

                    GEORGE
          Coming!

     He finally gets it together, but before he runs out the door,
     he does one last blast.

     INT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - HYANNIS - MATERNITY - DAY

     Mirtha is on the birthing table and screaming in pain.  She's
     crowning.  George wears hospital scrubs and a surgical mask.
     He and his saucer pupils hold Mirtha's hand in comfort.  The
     baby comes, and DOCTOR MICK BAY slaps it's behind and cuts
     the cord.  Tough ass Mirtha breaks down and sobs
     hysterically.  But something is wrong with George.  The color
     drains from his face.  He grabs his chest and falls over onto
     the floor.  The MEDICAL STAFF attends to him.

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          Watching my baby girl born did something
          to me.
          They talk about religious experiences, I
          didn't believe in religion.  But when
          Kristina Sunshine Jung came into this
          world, something in me changed.  I
          looked at her and I knew right then that
          I could never love anything but my
          daughter ever again.  It sounds sappy,
          but it was like, click, I knew what I
          was put on this planet for.  It was the
          greatest feeling I ever had followed by
          the worst feeling I ever had.

                    NURSE
          He fainted.

                    MIRTHA
          George!

     The doctor grabs George's wrist.

                    DR. BAY
          He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart
          is racing.  Have you been using drugs?

                    GEORGE
          Coke.

                    DR. BAY
          Cocaine?  How much?

                    GEORGE
          I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.

                    DR. BAY
          In how long?  A week?

                    GEORGE
          Today.

                    DR. BAY
          Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and
          start an i.v. stat!  This man is having
          a heart attack.

     INT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - HYANNIS - LATER

     George lies in the recovery room, sedated, tubes everywhere.
     He's hooked up to IV's, monitors, and machines.  Dr. Bay
     enters.

                    DR. BAY
          I've reviewed your toxicology report
          three times, George.  I've never seen
          anything like it.  Eighteen grams.
          The lethal dose is a gram and a half.
          You should be in the Guiness Book.

     George cracks a faint smile.

                    DR. BAY (CONT'D)
          It's not funny, George.  You should be
          dead right now.  Absolutely.  I cannot
          come up with one logical explanation for
          why you're still breathing.  I'm not
          here to give you lectures, I've got no
          moral interest in what you do.  But,
          take it easy, George.  Stay with us a
          while.  You've got a daughter now.

     INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DAY

     Kristina is crying.  Daddy George to the rescue.  He picks
     her up, cuddles her.  Gives her a bottle and she quiets.

     EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - FRONT YARD - 1980 - DAY

     A one-year-old Kristina is being coaxed by George to take her
     first steps.

                    GEORGE
          Come on.  Come on, honey.  You can do
          it.  Come to Daddy.

     Kristina tries, stumbles.  Gets up again.  She looks like a
     drunk, but she's doing it.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Good girl!

     Mirtha enters.  She's all pinned out, dressed in Ungaro,
     Cartier, and dark sunglasses.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.

                    MIRTHA
          She did that before.

                    GEORGE
          No.  These are her first steps.  Watch
          her.

                    MIRTHA
          Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.

                    GEORGE
          But this is...

                    MIRTHA
          I said, I've seen it before.

                    GEORGE
          Alright.

                    MIRTHA
          Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.

                    GEORGE
          Where are you going?

                    MIRTHA
          Out.

     The years go by and they are SUPERIMPOSED as they pass.
     George, clean and sober, enjoying family life.  Healthy and
     happy.  Mr. Mom.  Mirtha looks worse and worse as her habit
     becomes bigger and bigger.  As George and Kristina grow
     closer and closer, Mirtha is stepping out on the town.
     Blowing money right and left.  Shopping with Mirtha, buying
     clothes, furs, and diamonds.  As Kristina gets older, WE SEE
     her birthday parties.  George and Kristina wearing paper hats
     and eating ice cream.  She's two years old, she's three,
     four, five, six...

     INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - 1985 - NIGHT

     The Eastham house is all done up for a party deluxe.  Fully
     catered, with bartenders, waiters, music, the works.  And of
     course the three c's, champagne, caviar and Colombians.
     George is laughing with Augusto and Martha Oliveros, but when
     Derek Foreal appears in the doorway, George excuses himself
     and walks over.

                    DEREK
          Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited
          me.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah.  She told me.

                    DEREK
          Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I
          feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I
          did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me.
          Cut me out, too.

                    GEORGE
          I heard.

                    DEREK
          I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who
          my friends were.

                    GEORGE
          It's in the past.  I'm out of the
          business now, so forget about it.  No
          hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And
          besides, I'm sorry, too.

                    DEREK
          You?

                    GEORGE
          For calling you a homo.

                    DEREK
          That was out of line.

     George throws his arm around Derek's shoulder.

                    GEORGE
          Good to see you, Derek.

     Mirtha runs in with a giant crystal punch bowl filled with
     mother of pearl.  She holds it over her head triumphantly.

                    MIRTHA
          Now let's fucking party, motherfuckers!
          Let's have some fucking fun.

                    DEREK
          Jesus, is that Mirtha!?

     A very underweight Mirtha nervously runs around the party,
     shoving coke up everyone's noses.  She is gakked to the gills
     and out of control.  Her pupils a mile wide.

                    DEREK (CONT'D)
          Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a
          cheeseburger or something.  What does
          she weight, eighty pounds?

                    GEORGE
          I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's
          going to blow an O-ring.

     Singing.  The birthday cake is brought in, the candles are
     blown out and everyone cheers.
     Mirtha runs over to her husband, still holding the cocaine.
     She's sweaty, her hair matted down on one side.

                    MIRTHA
          Happy birthday, baby.  Do a line.

     She tries to push a line up his nose.

                    GEORGE
          No, that's alright.

                    MIRTHA
          Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down
          for once.  It's your fucking birthday,
          for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking
          pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this
          big time drug dealer and wound up with
          the maid.

     Mirtha's loud now and making a scene.  He thinks about it.

                    GEORGE
          No honey, I'm alright.

                    AUGUSTO
          A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I
          95, north and south.  My brother-in-law.
          Happy birthday!

     Everyone raises their glasses.

                    EVERYONE
          To George!

     A party guest comes running inside.

                    PARTY GUEST
          Cops!  They're all over the place.

     The WAITERS, in their white jackets, exchange knowing looks.
     The BARTENDER comes out from behind the bar.

                    BARTENDER
          Freeze!

     In an instant, all of the waiters' guns are out.

                    WAITER
          Massachusetts State Police Department!
          Everybody on the floor!

     EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - LATER

     Police cars everywhere.  All the party guests are filed out
     the door, and are being led away.  Mirtha is dragged out,
     spitting and screaming.  George, in handcuffs, is pushed to a
     squad car.  He looks through the window to see a FEMALE
     POLICE OFFICER escorting Kristina out of the house.

     INT. M.P.D. - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

     George, still dressed in his party clothes, sits at a desk.
     TWO DETECTIVES set a confession in front of him.

                    GEORGE
          What's this?

                    DETECTIVE #2
          It's your statement.  How it was all
          yours, the pound of coke was for
          personal use and none of the guests had
          any idea it was there, yeah, right.

     George looks through the papers.

                    GEORGE
          I want my kid out of protective custody.
          Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my
          kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when
          they call me safe and sound.

                    DETECTIVE #1
          No fucking way.

                    GEORGE
          Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.

     The detectives ponder.

                    DETECTIVE #2
          Do it.

     Detective #1 walks to the door.

                    DETECTIVE #1
          George?  You better get yourself a good
          lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your
          ass to the wall on this one.

                    GEORGE
          Oh hey, one more thing?

                    DETECTIVE #1
          What's that?

                    GEORGE
          Get me a six pack.

     EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT

     It's the middle of the night.  George walks through a dark
     and lonely house.  He goes to the furnace, opens it up and
     sees that there are only five stacks left.

                    GEORGE
          Fuck.

     EXT. JUNG HOUSE - WEYMOUTH - PORCH - MORNING

     George pulls up to the front.

                    GEORGE
          Hi.

                    FRED
          I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.

                    ERMINE (O.S.)
          Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell
          him he's not welcome here.

                    GEORGE
          Mom.

     Ermine's back is to George.  She won't look at him.

                    ERMINE
          Don't you dare step one foot in this
          house.  You're not my son, you hear me?
          I don't have a son anymore.

     She disappears into the house.  The sound of a door slamming.

                    FRED
          She's angry.  It's all over the news.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going
          away for awhile.

                    FRED
          You're not going to trial?

                    GEORGE
          No.

                    FRED
          Good.

     They stand there and look at each other for a while.  There's
     a lot to say but nothing's coming out.  George hands Fred a
     gym bag.

                    GEORGE
          Give this to Mom, will you?

                    FRED
          Money.  You and your mother.  All the
          time chasing it.  I never understood it.

                    GEORGE
          Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her
          happy.

                    FRED
          Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?

     The two men throw their arms around each other and hold on to
     one another in the doorway of the old house.

                    GEORGE
          Tell Mom, you know...

                    FRED
          I'll tell her.

     George breaks away and moves to the T-bird.

                    FRED (CONT'D)
          Take care of yourself.

     INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PANAMA CITY - 1985 - DAY

     George walks through the bank.

     INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PANAMA CITY - CONTINUOUS

     George sits at a desk in front of a Panamanian BANK EMPLOYEE.
     He slides his bank book across the table.

                    GEORGE
          I'd like to make a withdrawal.

     The employee opens the book and gets a funny look on his
     face.  Nervous.

                    BANK EMPLOYEE
          Excuse me, please.

     He gets up and moves to the BANK MANAGER.  They move to
     another MANAGER TYPE.  And another.
     And then everyone disappears behind closed doors.  Finally,
     the BANK PRESIDENT emerges and moves over to George.

                    BANK PRESIDENT
          I'm afraid there is a problem, Mr. Jung.
          The banks have gone through a change, a
          nationalization.  I'm afraid your funds
          have been appropriated by the Panamanian
          Government...

     George starts to shake.  The bank president tries to explain,
     but whatever he says is unimportant.  George is paralyzed.

     INT. APARTMENT - LIBERTY CITY, FLORIDA - NIGHT

     An inexpensive one-bedroom furnished apartment.  It ain't
     much, but it's home.  Mirtha has just received the news and
     is losing her mind.  Clara Blanca is cooking dinner.

                    MIRTHA
          What are we going to do?!  What are we
          going to use for money?!

                    GEORGE
          Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for
          Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight.
          I'll do something.

                    MIRTHA
          Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer
          the question.  What do I spend?  What?
          How will we live?

     Kristina sits there.  She hears everything, so does Clara
     Blanca.

                    GEORGE
          Not in front of the kid.

                    MIRTHA
          Don't give me that shit.  You just
          better do something.

     She storms into the bedroom and slams the door.  George
     stands there.  Awkward silence.  George goes to Kristina.

                    GEORGE
          Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
          Don't be upset.

                    KRISTINA
          What's happening to us?

     Tough question to answer.

                    GEORGE
          I don't know.

                    KRISTINA
          Are we gonna split up?

                    GEORGE
          No, never.  Don't even think about that,
          it's impossible.  I love your mother.
          And you are my heart.  Could I live
          without my heart?  Could I?

     Kristina nods "no."  They embrace.

     INT. GEORGE'S THUNDERBIRD - MIAMI - NIGHT

     The car moves along I-95.  George is driving while a jacked
     up Mirtha does a speed bump.  A cop is following in the
     distance.  It is not okay.

                    GEORGE
          There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha.
          Be cool, will ya.

                    MIRTHA
          Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.

                    GEORGE
          Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing
          cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your
          fucking problem?

                    MIRTHA
          My problem?  We're broke, that's my
          fucking problem.  And you're a fucking
          spy.

                    GEORGE
          What?

                    MIRTHA
          That's right.  Always spying, always
          judging.  Everyone's laughing at you,
          you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck
          you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking
          faggot.  You must be fucking Diego
          because you're not fucking me.

     Mirtha grabs nuts.

                    GEORGE
          Those are my nuts!

     George tries to fend her off.  The car swerves all over the
     road.  It's turned into a full scale fist fight.  The red
     lights of Florida's finest come up behind them and George is
     pulled over.

     EXT. I-95 - CONTINUOUS

     Mirtha leaps out of the car, teary eyed, crazed and bloodied.
     The policemen step from their car.

                    MIRTHA
          He's a fugitive and a fucking cocaine
          dealer!  There's a kilo in his trunk
          right now!  Take this sorry motherfucker
          to jail!

     George sits behind the wheel.  He knows it's over.

     INT. M.C.I. WALPOLE - VISITING AREA - 1989 - DAY

     SUPERIMPOSE: FOUR YEARS LATER

     Visiting day.  Inmates sit across from their families.
     Mirtha is sitting at the glass.  George walks to his seat.

                    MIRTHA
          I'm divorcing you, George.  I'm getting
          custody of Kristina.  And when you get
          out next week, you're going to pay
          support and that's the end of it.
          Alright?  There's someone else.  I'm
          sorry.

     George just looks at her.  His face is stone.  But he is
     moved.

                    MIRTHA (CONT'D)
          You should have taken better care of me,
          you know?  You've been away a long time.
          Four years.  Say something.

                    GEORGE
          What do you want me to say?  I'm in
          prison.  You should know.  You put me
          here.

                    MIRTHA
          Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say
          something like that.  Always thinking
          about yourself.

     She moves away and drags nine-year old Kristina into the
     room.
     Kristina yanks her arm away and they get into a heated
     argument.  Through the glass, George can't hear the words but
     it's clear that Kristina doesn't want to be here.

                    GEORGE
          My baby.  She's so big.

     Mirtha forces Kristina over to the glass and keeps showing
     her, prompting her to talk.  Kristina stares at George
     through the glass.  Cool.  Defiant.  Angry.  She picks up the
     phone and speaks, every word an accusation.

                    KRISTINA
          I thought you couldn't live without your
          heart.

     She drops the phone, walks away, and doesn't look back.

     INT. PHONE BOOTH - MIAMI STREETS - DAY

     George puts in the quarters.

                    GEORGE
          Hello, Derek?  It's George.  Yeah.
          Yeah, I am.  I'm in Miami.  I'm looking
          to do something.  I want to put together
          a crew.  Do you know anybody?  Leon?  I
          don't know him.  What's his last name?
          Alright.  Give me the number.

     EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MIAMI - DAY

     Nine-year old Kristina Jung leaves school.  George, fresh out
     of prison, moves across the street to meet her.

                    KRISTINA
          What are you doing here?

                    GEORGE
          Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I
          was out.  I just wanted to see you.

                    KRISTINA
          Well, here I am.  See?

                    GEORGE
          How are you doing?

                    KRISTINA
          George, you just can't show up, tell me
          you love me, and have everything be
          okay.

                    GEORGE
          Dad.

                    KRISTINA
          What?

                    GEORGE
          You can call me Dad if you want.

                    KRISTINA
          I don't want, alright?  It's not funny.
          I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew
          it, now leave me alone.

                    GEORGE
          Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going
          to make this right.  I've got a few
          things going on...

                    KRISTINA
          What do you want from me?

                    GEORGE
          Just to walk with you.  I want to be
          your dad again.

                    KRISTINA
          Do what you want, it's a free country.

     She walks away.  He follows.

     INT. THE PALM LOUNGE - MIAMI - DAY

     George sits at the bar with a man named LEON MINGHELLA.

                    LEON
          It's a four-man operation.  Two on the
          ground.  Two in the air.

                    GEORGE
          Who's the co-pilot?

                    LEON
          You're looking at him.  We provide the
          plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing
          spot, and take it to wherever you want
          it to go.  You provide the pick up point
          in South America, and are responsible
          for payment.  You assume all the bust
          risks.  We take sixty-five percent of
          all transportation fees, ten percent of
          the gross, plus our expenses.
          This is not a negotiation, so if this is
          okay with you, we can talk further.  If
          not, we can forget we had this
          conversation.

                    GEORGE
          Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet
          everybody.

                    LEON
          They're over at the booth.

     Leon leads George over.

                    LEON (CONT'D)
          Gentlemen, this is George.  George, this
          is Ben, G.G. and...

     George's eyes widen as he looks at the last man.  It's Kevin
     Dulli.

                    GEORGE
          Holy shit, Dulli!

                    KEVIN
          Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          That was it.  Seeing Dulli after
          fourteen years sealed the deal for me.
          The rest was just details.  My end was
          roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina
          and I could have a good life for five
          hundred grand.  Start over somewhere.
          One final score.  That's all I needed.

     INT. OLIVEROS MANSION - MIAMI - DAY

                    AUGUSTO
          Three-hundred kilos is a very big load,
          Georgie.  Why don't we start small?

                    GEORGE
          No.  I have the space.  I figured it
          out.  This is what I want to do.

                    AUGUSTO
          Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's
          for you.  I don't think there will be a
          problem.

                    GEORGE
          Five-thousand per kilo.

                    AUGUSTO
          Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those
          days are over.  The rate is one-thousand
          dollars.  Inflation, you know?

                    GEORGE
          This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One
          and I'm out.  Give me a good price for
          old time's sake.  What do you think?

     EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MIAMI - DAY

     George and Kristina walk through the neighborhood.  He
     carries her books.

                    GEORGE
          Let me ask you something.  If you could
          go anywhere in the world, anywhere,
          where would you want to go?

                    KRISTINA
          You mean, like a trip?

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, sure, whatever.

     Kristina thinks about it.

                    KRISTINA
          I don't know.  Maybe California.

     George is amused by her answer.

                    GEORGE
          California?  You can go anywhere in the
          world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia.
          Paris.  And you choose California?

                    KRISTINA
          Yeah.

                    GEORGE
          What is it?  A Disneyland thing?

                    KRISTINA
          No.  I just kind of like the sound of
          it.

                    GEORGE
          California, huh?

                    KRISTINA
          California.

     They turn a corner and arrive at Kristina's house.  Mirtha is
     standing in the doorway.

                    GEORGE
          Go on inside now.  I want to talk to
          your mom alone.

     He kisses his daughter goodbye.

                    KRISTINA
          Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?

                    GEORGE
          I'll be here.

     George moves over to Mirtha.  It's been a while.

                    MIRTHA
          What do you want?

                    GEORGE
          You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?

                    MIRTHA
          Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to
          school.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love
          her, y'know?  I kind of want to have
          her.  I've been away for so long.  Make
          up for the missed time, you know?

                    MIRTHA
          I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You
          haven't paid me one cent in child
          support, alimony.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've
          got something going.

                    MIRTHA
          Yeah?  I better see some money out of
          it.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, you will.  Of course.

     Mirtha looks at her ex-husband.  It's not all bad.

                    MIRTHA
          Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows
          what will happen.  You're a good father,
          George.  I always gave you that.  But
          you've got to talk to her.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah.

                    MIRTHA
          She's getting big.  Getting her own
          ideas.

                    GEORGE
          I know.  Well, that's all I really
          wanted to say.  So, okay, then.

     He moves down the steps and heads for the sidewalk.

                    MIRTHA
          Hey, George.  You okay?

                    GEORGE
          Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.

     INT. THE PALM LOUNGE - DAY

     The restaurant is filled with the team.  They discuss, argue,
     re-examine every little detail.

                    KEVIN
          We take off from Lauderdale, Sunday,
          refuel, and be in Medellin by Monday.

                    LEON
          Overnight, refuel, and back Wednesday
          night.

                    GEORGE
          Where are you coming in?

                    BEN
          Vero Beach.

                    G.G.
          It's good.  It's small.

                    LEON
          Then we drive it to the Lauderdale house
          where it stays until pick up and payment
          the next morning.  You want to go over
          it again?

                    GEORGE
          No.  All set.  Piece of cake.

     INT. GEORGE'S STUDIO APARTMENT - MIAMI - NIGHT

     George is cooking dinner for Kristina.  He's only got a hot
     plate so it's slow.  The table is set with plasticware.
     Kristina chops the salad.

                    GEORGE
          I'm thinking about getting out of town
          this week.  You want to come with me?

                    KRISTINA
          Where are you going?

                    GEORGE
          I don't know.  Maybe California.

                    KRISTINA
          You swear?

                    GEORGE
          Yeah.  Go out there, check it out, see
          what it's like.  I've got some stuff to
          do this week, but I'm thinking maybe
          Thursday.  Thursday after school.

                    KRISTINA
          You know I can't.  Mom will never let me
          go.

                    GEORGE
          You let me take care of your mother.
          You just pack your bags.

                    KRISTINA
          But I've got school.

                    GEORGE
          There's schools in California.

                    KRISTINA
          You swear?

                    GEORGE
          That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday.
          At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a
          date.

                    KRISTINA
          I don't believe you.

                    GEORGE
          I swear.  On my life.

                    KRISTINA
          Swear on my life.

                    GEORGE
          I swear on your life.

     EXT. VERO BEACH AIRFIELD - DUSK

     George, Ben and G.G. wait on the tarmac.  George is pacing.
     The sound of a Cessna is heard and soon it is dropping out of
     the sky.  The plane lands and taxis over.

     Kevin and Leon stick their fists out of the airplane in
     triumph.  The men quickly unload the plane into the trunks of
     two Broncos and the back of a truck.

     INT. FT. LAUDERDALE HOUSE - NIGHT

     WE FOLLOW the duffel bags out of the Bronco into the house.
     The boys sit around as George samples the product.

                    KEVIN
          Are we good?

                    GEORGE
          Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're
          beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A
          grade, one-hundred percent pure
          Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen.
          Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow.
          Good riddance.

     He looks the boys over.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          You saved my life, Dulli.  You'll never
          fucking know.  All you guys.  Everyone
          just got a raise.  Instead of ten
          percent, you get fifteen.

                    LEON
          Jesus, George, fifteen percent.  That's
          an extra two-hundred large.

                    GEORGE
          I don't give a shit.  Split it up.  Have
          a great life.  I'm done.  I'm out.
          Starting over.  Cheers.

     They clank.  George gets up and does the Snoopy Dance to the
     bathroom.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Yeah!  Unbelievable.  Dulli, pour us
          another round.  I gotta hit the head.

     George leaves the room.  The camera slowly pans back to the
     guys.  Something doesn't look right.  They have not moved.
     They look bummed.  Leon looks at G.G.

                    LEON
          What?

                    G.G.
          I feel bad.

                    BEN
          Me too.  He's not such a bad guy.

                    KEVIN
          Fuck you guys.  All of you.  I've known
          him for thirty fucking years.  Fucking
          George.

                    LEON
          Yeah, I like him, too.  But what's done
          is done.  So let's not get all
          sentimental about it, okay?

     The CAMERA PANS BACK SLOWLY to the bathroom door, George
     comes back into the room, dancing.  He goes and sits down
     with the guys.

                    GEORGE
              (laughing)
          Dulli, I was just thinking about that
          time we landed in Mexico.  You've gotten
          a lot better since then, huh pal?
          Remember that fucking landing strip?
          Huh?

     George is the only one smiling.  No one is looking at him.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Hey, what's wrong fellas?  Why the long
          faces?

     He looks at each one.  He slowly realizes something's up.  He
     looks to Dulli finally.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
              (defeated)
          No.  C'mon, Dulli.

     The front door busts down, agents pour in.  The CAMERA SWISH
     PANS to George.  Lights out.  Slow motion.  Slow dolly into
     XCU.

     EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1999 - DAY

     George has tears in his eyes.  He is frozen.  Paralyzed by
     the memories.

                    GEORGE
          Oh, no.

     INT. FT. LAUDERDALE HOUSE - 1989 - DAY

     The voices from the bust can be heard as the CAMERA PUSHES
     SLOWLY into George's face.  Surreal.

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          I was busted.  Set up by the FBI and the
          DEA.  That didn't bother me.  Set up by
          Kevin Dulli and Derek Foreal to save
          their own asses.  That didn't bother me.
          Sentenced to sixty years at Otisville.
          That didn't bother me.

     EXT. MIRTHA'S HOUSE - MIAMI - 1989 - DAY

     Nine-year old Kristina Sunshine Jung sits on the front porch
     as the sun goes down.  Her bags are packed and ready to go.

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          I had broken a promise.  Everything I
          loved in my life goes away.

     INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - 1989 - DAY

     George is led into a small room and greeted by his lawyer,
     ARCHIE ZIGMOND.

                    ZIGMOND
          Here's the deal, George.  You're not
          getting out.  I tried to get you
          furloughed, but your mother squashed it.
          Said it would only upset him.  I'm
          sorry.

     George takes it in.  Blinks.  The years have not been kind.

                    GEORGE
          How's he doing?

                    ZIGMOND
          Well, he's out of the hospital, but
          there's not much anyone can do for him.
          It's just a matter of time.  Listen, I
          brought a tape recorder in case you
          wanted to say something to him.  That
          way he could hear your voice.

                    GEORGE
          Right.

     Zigmond sets the tape recorder down and leaves the room.
     George stares long at the machine.  He pushes the record
     button and looks at the red light.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Hello, Dad...

     EXT. JUNG HOUSE - DAY

     A sixty-nine year old Fred shuffles from his house to the

     into the deck.

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          You know, I remember a lifetime ago, I
          was about three-and-a-half feet tall,
          weighing all of sixty-pounds, every inch
          your son...

     EXT. JUNG HOUSE - 1953 - DAY

     Six-year old George runs through the leaves to the truck and
     rides to work with his father.

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          ...those Saturday mornings going to work
          with my Dad.  We'd climb into that big
          yellow truck.  I used to think it was
          the biggest truck in the world.

          was.
          How if it weren't for us, people would
          freeze to death.  I thought you were the
          strongest man in the world.

     James J. Trout pulls a handcuffed George's boots over his

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had
          to get on his knees to put my boots on?
          You said...

          That's where you belong...

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          That was a good one, Dad.  That was
          really something.  Remember that?

     INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1989 - DAY

     George's eyes well up and he sparks a cigarette, as he keeps
     trying to tell his father goodbye.

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          And that time you told me that money
          wasn't real?  Well, old man, I'm forty
          two years old.  I finally learned what
          you tried to tell me so many years ago.

     INT. FRED'S LTD. - 1989 - CONTINUOUS

     Tears come crashing out of the old man's stoic face.

                    GEORGE (V.O.)
          I finally understand.  You're the best,
          Dad.  I just wish I could have done more
          for you.  I wish we had more time.

     EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1999 - DAY

     A vision of Fred Jung sits on the ground before his fifty-two
     year old son.

                    GEORGE
          I guess I kind of lost sight of things.
          "May the wind always be at your back and
          the sun always upon your face, and the
          winds of destiny carry you aloft to
          dance with the stars."  Love, George.

                    FRED
          That was a beautiful message.

                    GEORGE
          I meant every word of it.

                    FRED
          Did you know I died two weeks after you
          sent me that tape?

     The apparition of Fred disappears and George is left alone
     once again.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, Dad.  I knew that.

     INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1990 - DAY

     George is led into the room where THREE FBI MEN await him.
     One of them is named FRED GARCIA.

                    GARCIA
          How are you doing, George?

                    GEORGE
          What do you guys want?

                    GARCIA
          You hear about your old friend, Diego?

                    GEORGE
          What about him?

     Garcia tosses a newspaper onto the table.  The Miami Herald.
     Inside is a full page letter addressed from Diego Delgado to
     Vice President George Bush.  In the letter, Diego offers to
     make a deal.  In exchange for immunity, Diego will rat out
     the entire cocaine business.  Americans, Colombians, Noriega,
     Escobar, everybody.  Just let him free.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?

                    GARCIA
          He's going down, George.  It's election
          year.  We're not making any deals.

                    FBI GUY #1
          He's never getting out.  Orders from the
          top.

                    GARCIA
          So, how would you like to help us put
          him away?

                    FBI GUY #2
          We've done our homework.  We know you
          hate this motherfucker.

                    GEORGE
          I don't think so.

                    GARCIA
          Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him.
          We've got him dead to rights.  But like
          I said, this is top priority so we're
          handing out free passes on this one.
          And the first one's got your name on it.
          Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.

                    GEORGE
          No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong
          fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.

     INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - VISITOR'S ROOM - 1990 - DAY

     George sits in the chair behind the plexiglass.  Mirtha
     enters and takes a seat on the other side.

          Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything
          okay with Kristina?

                    MIRTHA
          Kristina's fine.

                    GEORGE
          Is she here?  Is she coming?

                    MIRTHA
          Is she here?  George, Kristina hates
          you.  You fucked her over one too many
          times.  And I'm not here to socialize.
          Did you hear about Diego?

                    GEORGE
          Yeah.

                    MIRTHA
          Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said
          this thing with Diego is a disaster.
          He's giving up lab locations, names,
          bank accounts, he was very pissed off.
          Pablo said to take him down.  His exact
          words were "Fuck Diego."

                    GEORGE
          He wants me to testify?  Is that what
          he's asking me to do?

                    MIRTHA
          George, he wasn't asking.

     Mirtha gets up and starts to move away.

                    GEORGE
          Mirtha, how are you doing?

                    MIRTHA

          I'll see what I can do, George.

                    GEORGE
          Thanks, Arch.

     They walk into the crowded courtroom.

     INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - JACKSONVILLE - 1990 - DAY

     Packed.  Nuts.  Standing room only.  The courtroom buzzes as
     George is led down the center aisle and is handed off to the
     bailiff.  Over this we hear...

                    CLERK
          Sir, please state your name.

                    GEORGE
          I'm George Jung.  Spelled J-U-N-G.

                    CLERK
          Thank you.

                    PROSECUTOR
          Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?

                    GEORGE
          Yes, I do.

                    PROSECUTOR
          Do you see him here in the courtroom?

                    GEORGE
          Yes, he's sitting right there at the end
          of the table.

                    PROSECUTOR
          Let the record state the witness has
          identified, Diego Delgado.

     The following sound bytes are dissolved together in montage
     style...

                    PROSECUTOR (CONT'D)
          Mr. Jung, can you describe the
          circumstances of how you began talking
          about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?

                    GEORGE
          Shortly after I arrived at Danbury
          Federal Correctional Institute I related
          to Diego that the crime I was in for was
          smuggling marijuana.
          Diego told me he had high level
          connections in Colombia and they needed
          to find someone to help them transport
          cocaine into America...

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          The first run was fifteen kilos, which
          we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard
          shelled suitcases.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen
          cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way
          if there were any dogs in customs...

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack
          Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of
          cocaine per week into the United States
          via twin-engine Cessnas.  Jack would fly
          into North Carolina, we'd meet him there
          and drive it down to different
          distribution points...

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I never met Pablo Escobar.  Diego
          Delgado was my only connection to
          cocaine from Colombia...

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Diego convinced me to keep most of my
          money in a Panamanian bank.  Diego had a
          close relationship with Manuel Noriega.
          In exchange for allowing us to keep our
          money there, we paid him a percentage.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          There was an 85% chance that if you
          snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it
          was ours. Initially with my LA
          connections, we invented the
          marketplace.  In 1977, there was no
          other real competition.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          The first year we made about 100 million
          dollars between us.  It was an expensive
          operation.  Eventually we built up to
          three different pilots doing multiple
          runs per week, connections on both
          coasts, everything was running smooth.
          We were like a corporation...

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          he was very anti-government.  He talked
          about revolution, forming his own
          country or island, he was looking for
          power as well as money.  I was just
          looking for money.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          He disliked the United States, thought
          it was a police state.  He hoped that by
          flooding the country with cocaine, it
          would disrupt the political system and
          tear down the morality of the country.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my
          connection, I met him back in 1968 when
          I first moved to Manhattan Beach.  It
          was Foreal's marijuana connections that
          kicked off our cocaine market.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos
          to Los Angeles.  When Diego finally got
          Derek Foreal's name from me, it was only
          a matter of months before he'd cut me
          out.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          I'm not sure how my relationship with my
          daughter and ex-wife have anything to do
          with this trial.  I mean we're here to
          talk about Diego Delgado, aren't we?

                    CALIBANOS
          Yes, we are Mr. Jung.

     We come out of the montage, the defense attorney Diego
     Delgado, Joe Calibanos, a sleazy-Greek-like-ex-basketball
     weight lifter guy is now doing the questioning.

                    CALIBANOS (CONT'D)
          Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon,
          correct?

                    GEORGE
          Yes, I am.

                    CALIBANOS
          Do you have any agreement or
          understanding whatsoever with the United
          States government in regards to your
          testimony?

                    GEORGE
          No, I cam here out of my own volition.

                    CALIBANOS
          Excuse me?

                    GEORGE
          Something about vengance being best
          served cold.

                    CALIBANOS
          Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?

                    GEORGE
          Excuse me?

                    CALIBANOS
          Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or
          understanding with the United States
          Government in connection with your
          testimony in this case?

                    GEORGE
          I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no
          chance of parole.  Even if they cut my
          sentence in half I'll be seventy-three
          years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I
          don't know if the parole board, the
          judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself
          can get me out of here.  I have a really
          bad record, I'm not sure what's going to
          happen.

                    CALIBANOS
          So you do have an agreement with the
          United States Government, Mr. Jung,
          correct?

     George can't respond.  Looks to Diego.  Looks from the jury,
     the judge, George is on the spotlight and it's uncomfortable.
     He feels suddenly sleazy.

                    CALIBANOS (CONT'D)
          I thought so.  No more questions.

     Silence.  The judge tells George he can step down.  Calibanos
     laughs quietly with associates.  George is bummed.  He walks
     by Diego.  They look at each other.

                    GEORGE
          You shouldn't have taken the 30 million,
          Diego, I was out.

     George is lead away.

                    CLERK
          The court calls Mr. Jack Stevens.

     Jack Stevens is lead to the stand.  WE SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

     INT. CAR - 1999 - DAY

     The green of the New York State countryside drifts by as a
     brown Mazda moves along Highway 19.  Behind the wheel is a
     beautiful 20 year old woman wearing dark sunglasses.  She
     drives absently, her mind somewhere else.

     INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - VISITOR'S ENTRANCE - 1999 - DAY

     The woman is buzzed through the double doors.  She moves to
     the MAN behind the desk and takes off her sunglasses.

                    KRISTINA
          I'm here to see my father.

                    ADMISSIONS OFFICER
          Name?

                    KRISTINA
          Kristina Sunshine Jung.

     EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - LATE AFTERNOON

     The GUARDS are rounding up the other prisoners and escorting
     them inside, but George is still planting sunflowers.

                    GUARD
          Hey, George, five more minutes, buddy.

     INT. VISITOR'S ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

     The admissions officer looks up from his paperwork.

                    ADMISSIONS OFFICER
          Jung.

     Kristina grabs her papers and moves to the counter.

                    ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D)
          Belongings in here.

     Kristina empties her pockets and deposits her possessions
     into a locker box.  She is handed a key.

                    ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D)
          Feet on the blue line.

     Kristina stands on a blue piece of tape and the admissions
     officer buzzes open the giant metal door.  But Kristina
     doesn't move.

                    ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D)
          Miss?

     He presses the buzzer again, but she just stands there.

                    ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D)
          Miss?  Something wrong?

     EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - CONTINUOUS

     George turns around as a GUARD taps him on the shoulder.

                    GUARD
          George?  George, come on.  You've got a
          visitor.

     George looks up to find Kristina being buzzed through the
     gate.  She moves through the open area and onto the grass
     quickly.  SLOW MOTION: Father and daughter come together at
     last in a long embrace.

                    GEORGE
          I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.

                    KRISTINA
          It's alright, Dad.

                    GEORGE
          I didn't mean to...

                    KRISTINA
          I know, Dad.  I know...

     He hugs her hard.

                    GEORGE
          I fucked up.

                    KRISTINA
          Shhhh.

                    GEORGE
          I love you.  I love you so much.  You've
          got to know that.  You've got to know.

                    KRISTINA
          I know, Dad.  I love you too.

                    GEORGE
          After everything.  After everything, the
          only thing left out of my whole life is
          you.

     Kristina looks at her father, smiles, and disappears.  There
     was no Kristina.  The guard continues to tap.

                    GUARD
          George?  George, come on.  It's getting
          dark.

     George looks up to find a prison guard.  His name is GUS, and
     he helps George to his feet.

                    GEORGE
          But I have a visitor.

                    GUS
          Not today, George.  Time to go back.

                    GEORGE
          But I want to put her name on the list
          for tomorrow.  My daughter.

                    GUS
          Okay, George.

                    GEORGE
          Because she's visiting me.

                    GUS
          We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's
          lockdown time.

     The shadows grow long, and Gus leads George down a cement
     path that cuts through the grass.  The huge structure of
     Otisville looms dark against the sky, and Gus and George take
     the long walk back.

     EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - DUSK

     Standing outside the fences, Kristina smokes a cigarette as
     she watches her father being led away.  After a few moments,
     she turns around, walks to her car and gets in.  Time to go
     home.  And as the brown Mazda pulls out of the driveway, the
     taillights turn red, growing smaller and smaller, until they
     finally disappear.

     THE END.
