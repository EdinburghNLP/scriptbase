1   INT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY                                      1

    WE MEET: MUMBLES(late 30s) and ONE TWO (late 30s). They are
    listening to a sales pitch from two REAL ESTATE AGENTS.

    We SEE all the relevant pictures of their pitch explaining a
    changing city, LONDON.

                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.)
              Two years ago this property cost one
              million pounds.
                  (we SEE building)
              Today, it costs five million.

    The camera WHIP PANS over to another part of the building to
    see the other ESTATE AGENT giving his pitch. The camera
    will keep this back and forth for the duration of the scene.
                            OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.)
              How did this happen?
                  (CUT TO relevant
                   pictures as he speaks)
              Attractive tax opportunities for
              foreign investment, restrictive
              building consent and massive hedge
              fund bonuses,...
                  (beat)
              London, my good man, is fast becoming
              the financial and cultural capital
              of the world.

                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              And of course the Russians have come
              to town.

                            OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              Makes it hard to compete with an ex-
              Soviet oligarch that has six billion
              dollars in his back pocket. They
              don't haggle the price, they double
              the price.

                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              Russians come, prices rise, and it
              doesn't stop. It only goes one way.

                            OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              Up.

                            SLICK ESTATE AGENT
              I can't teach you how to skin a cat,
              but I can tell you a lot about the
              money in bricks and mortar.

                 Like he said, it's going one way.

    One Two and Mumbles look at one another.

                             ONE TWO
              We need to see a Lawyer.

    CUT TO a modern looking LAWYER'S office.   We SEE the LAWYER
    advising MUMBLES AND ONE TWO.

    ONE TWO and the LAWYER are here looking at the building, it
    is a bit dilapidated and bleak.

                             LAWYER TYPE
              It looks like a great deal.

4   INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE                                             4

    We cut back into the office where the LAWYER lays out the
    building plans.

                             LAWYER TYPE
              These are the plans,...it costs ten
              and it'll be worth twenty with
              planning. But first you gotta give
              the councilor a drink.

5   INT. COUNCILOR'S OFFICE                                          5

    CUT TO the desk of a COUNCILOR (mid thirties middle
    management)who is receiving a brown envelope from the LAWYER.

                             COUNCILOR
                  (off the envelope)
              Tell them they'll get the planning,...

    We CUT BACK to our LAWYER now smug.    One Two and Mumbles are
    standing in front of him.

                             LAWYER TYPE
              You'll get the planning. Take care
              of the councilor and it will move
              like shit through a goose.

     MEET LENNY COLE(50s, dark, a little tubby), Mumbles and One
     Two are here. Lenny's office is kitsch, he fancies himself
     as a man of class.

                             LENNY COLE

               mortar, properties are always the
               safe bet, but you better know what

               money. You trip up,...

     The Councilor is the phone to the Lawyer.      He speaks in hushed
     tones clandestine like.

                              COUNCILOR
                   (into phone)
               Can't talk now, but there has been a
               problem. I can't get you the
               planning.

                              ONE TWO
               He can't get the planing.

                              MUMBLES

10   EXT. DERELICT BUILDING                                               10

     Lenny is looking out to One Two and Mumbles who are standing
     outside his car looking very white. Lenny screams from the
     back seat.

                              LENNY COLE
               What do you mean you can't get the
               fuckin planning?
                   (pointing)
               There is seven million of my cash in
               there, without planning it's worth
               five,...you owe me. I take the
               building, you lose your share, but I
               am still outta pocket two large ones.
               Find it.

     The window goes up and the car pulls off.      Lenny picks up
     his phone, he dials huffing and puffing.

                 Is that you Councilor?
                      (Lenny smiles)
                 I hear you got that car you was
                 after,....now, sort the planning
                 out.

                             COUNCILOR (V.O.)
                 Sorted Lenny.

     He puts the phone down and looks over smiling.     MEET ARCHY
     (Lenny's right hand man, 50s).

                             LENNY COLE
                 What's wrong with you Arch?
                             ARCHY
                 That's a bit strong isn't it Len?
                 They come from the same place as
                 you, you'll clean 'em out.

                             LENNY COLE
                 Same place as me? Do I look like an
                 immigrant Archy?
                     (beat)
                 No one gave me a leg up, did they?
                 They need a bit of fear, 'cos
                 otherwise they're gonna come up
                 against me,...need a little lesson
                 don't they?

     On each side of him are two ESCORTS(ex-military types, heavy
     looking). As they pass each door, we realize where ever he
     is going, it has to be important. The ESCORTS talk in to
     their microphones and to the different GUARDS on each door
     way.

     Every now and then we see the SPORTS ARENA in the back ground.
     At last we reach the main door to the head office.

14   INT. HEAD OFFICE                                                 14

     As the door is opened we see a small crowd of MEN in suits
     gathered around a kind-looking MAN with bright blue eyes.
     He nods a couple of times.

     We CUT TO the front of Lenny who is clearly impressed, Mr.
     Blue eyes pays him no attention. The small crowd of business
     MEN shake hands and head to the door at which Lenny is waiting
     patiently.

15   INT. SPORTS ARENA -- DAY                                         15

     CLOSE UP on the back of URI (Russian Jew, 40s, slick, and
     well groomed, he is our Mr. Blue Eyes) overlooking his sports
     arena. We stay on the back of Uri's head while he is talking
     to Lenny.

                             URI
               Glad you could join us here Lenny.

                             LENNY COLE
               It's nice to see you Uri.

                             URI
               Good.
                   (there is a pause)
               I can see we are very much alike you
               and I Lenny. We like to get things
               done.
                   (beat)
               What's it going to cost me?

                             LENNY COLE
               First, let me make clear how much we
               can help you benefit from this deal.
               With out me, it will take you five
               to ten years to get the permission
               to erect your arena.
                   (beat)
               Second, with Government policy as it
               so stands we both know it's unlikely
               that you'd ever get that consent.
                   (beat)
               Thirdly, in legal fees, transactions
               and building consent, you'd be paying
               6 to 12 million without any real
               guarantee of that result.

     We CUT TO Uri unfazed, he just wants the figure.

               I expect a guarantee that I have
               consent within six months and no red

               That's right Uri, you can consider
               that done.

     Pause while tension stews, then,...

16   INT. SPORTS ARENA - PRIVATE BAR                                 16

     Uri walks to the bar. Lenny follows trying to contain his
     excitement, he's out of his league, a "welcome to the
     billionaires club" look has struck him pink. Lenny passes a
     PICTURE that's sat on an EASEL.

                              LENNY COLE
               Oh, that's a nice picture Uri, hasn't
               it got, errrh depth?

     Uri is at the bar now. He has placed one large tumbler down
     and is pouring a very very large measure out.

                              URI
               That picture has brought me nothing
               but luck Lenny,..it's my lucky
               picture.
                   (he has a good idea)
               You like? Take it for a while, maybe
               it will give you luck.

                              LENNY COLE
               Oh I couldn't Uri,...

     Still absorbed with the painting.

                              URI
               Now we're partners, I insist. I
               will get it sent around to your house
               and you can give it back to me when
               our deal is finalized.

     Lenny looks at the bar. Uri motions, there is a SMALL KEG
     of WHISKEY on the bar and only one large glass.

17   INT. LENNY'S CAR - DAY                                              17

     Lenny enters the back seat of his car, Archy is waiting for
     him in the back.

                              ARCHY
               You all right there Len?      You look a
               little pink.

               Turbo, get us a perrier and a wet
               wipe live-o.

     Lenny's panting.

                              LENNY COLE (CONT'D)
               Tried to poison me the dirty
               Cossack...

     TURBO (Lenny's driver) is fumbling around in the front seat
     trying to get ice into a glass from the cooler that sits
     beside him.

                              LENNY COLE (CONT'D)
               Stop messing about and give us the
               bottle Turbo.
                              ARCHY
               So, how's the billionaires club?

     Lenny grabs the drink, desperately takes a big glug of water
     and wipes his face.

                              LENNY COLE

     Uri looks at VICTOR (Uri's right hand man).   They're looking
     down at Lenny's disappearing car.

                             VICTOR
               You think you should have leant him
               your lucky picture?

19   INT. ACCOUNTANT TAX OFFICES                                      19

     A man and woman sit on one side of a desk, MEET STELLA AND
     BERTIE. Bertie is 45 and handsome in a dark posh sort of
     way. Stella is 32, film star. Sitting opposite them are
     two TAX MEN(civil servant types, grey, middle aged, a little
     tubby and bald). There's a stand off.

                             STELLA
               Look, can we shut the door?

     There's a pause while the TAX MAN looks at his colleague.

                             TAX MAN
               Shut the door.

     His colleague gets up and shuts the door.

                             STELLA
               Let's put our cards on the table.
               We both know you aren't going to get
               the full forty out of my clients.

                             TAX MAN
               This is the tax office and in the
               end we get what we want.

                  Save that speech for the tourists
                  Charlie and let's strike a deal -
                  take the twenty now and let it go.
                  Otherwise, they'll move the company
                  off shore tomorrow and you'll spend
                  the next twenty years chasing an
                  imaginary forty million around every
                  republic that grows bananas.

     Bertie lifts out papers from his brief case.

                              TAX MAN
                  I see why you married her now Bertie.

     The two TAX MEN look at each other, they're thinking the
     same thought.

                  I told you we'd make a great team,..
                  You know why you get those deals?

     She looks relatively bored.

                              BERTIE (CONT'D)
                  Because those fat, sad, old men like
                  it when you swear at them. They
                  shake like cocktails and sweat like
                  semtex when you raise that posh little
                  voice. You my love are a rare
                  commodity.
                      (beat)
                  Now come on, give your Bertie a smile.

                              STELLA
                  I don't feel like smiling. I am a
                  thirty two year old accountant married
                  to a homosexual lawyer.
                      (beat)
                  I'm a beard without kids Bertie!
                  I'm in a marriage of convenience
                  that can be quite inconvenient at
                  times.

     The phone rings, Bertie picks it up and answers.

                              BERTIE
                  Yes, she's right here.

     Two guys are here counting money. MEET ROMAN and MICKEY,
     two black Americans. (Mid 30s dressed very classy, with a
     bit of an urban twist) They are in the managing game,
     exploiting the talents of the English.

     The sound of distant bass thudding through the walls can be
     heard while Mickey is on the phone trying to do some kind of
     business. A real ROCKER with long hair and good looks comes
     walking in distressed.

                  I need the dry ice Mickey, I need
                  the dry ice. My show just doesn't

                  If you told me yesterday you needed
                  dry ice, I would have gotten you the
                  driest ice the world could offer,
                  but you didn't ask for no dry ice.
                  You asked for two cases of Johnny
                  Walker black label and four ladies
                  of the pole and I got them for you
                  didn't I?

     There's a pause from the Rocker.

                  Didn't I?

                  you're the manager and I am the
                  rocker. You've got on the managers
                  hat, now pluck something out of it.

                                 MICKEY
                  My hat is deep and full of magic. I
                  got rabbits, handkerchiefs, and ladies
                  of the pole drinking Black Label. I
                  got smoke machines, bubble machines,
                  I even got love marines and still
                  the hat goes deeper, but....there
                  ain't no mother fuckin dry ice.

     On the tennis court we see the COUNCILOR(our man from the
     beginning), who is playing tennis with TERRY THE INSTRUCTOR.
     The Councilor is taking it seriously apart from the
     distraction of JACKIE on the next door court. ARCHY is here
     watching over the game and reading the paper, we see him
     read an article and look a little moved. Lenny comes up
     behind him and starts to read over his shoulder.

               I don't know what to say Lenny.

                              LENNY COLE
               I bet he took a lot of people with
               him in his hot little crack pipe.

               We will never mention this again,
               all right Arch?

     Archy looks a little shocked.     Lenny carries on like nothing
     has happened.

               Now, tell the Councilor to stop fuckin

               him inside.

     The Councilor is thinking explicit thoughts.

                             ARCHY (CONT'D)
                Do you know Jackie?

     Nervous, the Councilor knows these thugs aren't shy.

                No, no, no, Archy, don't say anything.

                Only if he's wicked.

                They say that times are changing

               Errh, I think they are probably right,
               times have changed, but that shouldn't
               affect you Lenny.

     He walks toward the door as Jackie is walking in, Lenny looks
     slyly at her as they pass.

                              LENNY COLE (CONT'D)
               Look after him Jackie.

     In the distance.

                              COUNCILOR
               Oh Lenny, you forgot your lighter.

     Lenny looks back to the Councilor.

                              LENNY COLE
               Can't be mine, it's got your name on
               it.

     CUT TO the bottom of the lighter, "THE COUNCILOR." Lenny
     carries on walking and smiling.

28   EXT. PARK - MORNING                                                 28

     It's the next morning, we SEE One Two running. Mumbles and
     Handsome Bob pull up along side of him in their car. There
     is a moment of pause while they admire One Two running along
     side of them.

                              MUMBLES
               Don't you get bored of that? I mean,

               you wanna run, why don't you run to
               the shops or do something useful?

                              ONE TWO
               You could do with some of this

               I reckon he's trying to get fit for

               Bob on her. That'll liven you up

               Bob wouldn't know where to begin.

               I'm good with the posh ones, don't
               you worry about that.

                              ONE TWO

     One Two sprints off leaving them behind.

     Lenny is pacing in a ladies dressing gown with long silk
     socks. He can't sleep, he pours a large one, lights a cigar,
     picks up the phone and dials.

     the office chair disappears from under him, he takes the

     There is a bald spot above his head where a picture once
     stood, a picture light illuminates an clearly empty space.
     He is horrified by the stupidity of the question.

                               LENNY COLE
                  Let's take a wild stab in the dark
                  shall we Bandy? Archy slap him and
                  then send him to school 'cos I can't
                  take any more of this. You sort it
                  out, get that picture back and bring
                  me a body, I am going to back to
                  bed.

     He stomps off to bed.

                               ARCHY
                  Bandy if you ever ask a stupid
                  question like that again, you see
                  Danny there? He's gonna slap you.

                               BANDY
                  Sorry Arch, it's just,...I was trying
                  to use initiative.

                               ARCHY
                  Danny slap him.

     DANNY slaps him with the back of his left hand.       Archy's not
     happy - it was the wrong hand.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)
                  With the right Danny,..properly.

     DANNY slaps him again, it's weak.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)
                  I said properly, with the back of
                  your right hand Danny.

                               DANNY
                  What is this a tennis match Arch?

                               ARCHY
                  Slap him!

     DANNY slaps him again, BANDY takes it good. Archy huffs and
     goes over to slap him proper, SLAP! Bandy's disappeared
     into another dimension.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)

     Mumbles, Handsome Bob, and One Two are standing here dressed
     as security guards. Handsome Bob is watching over the car
     that is waiting for the TWO ACCOUNTANTS to come out of the
     back door of the warehouse. One Two and Mumbles are to the

     One Two see's the door open and makes a move. Two ACCOUNTANTS
     come out of the back door, while in route they click their
     central locking open on the car waiting. One Two is already
     on them as the ACCOUNTANTS go to open their car door.

               Hello lads.

     He flashes the gun in his belt. The ACCOUNTANTS are too
     shocked to even know what is going on.

               Put the bags in the car and walk

     The ACCOUNTANTS see the gun, but still look for a way out.
     Mumbles meets them with another gun.

     The ACCOUNTANTS do as they are told. One Two and Mumbles
     get into the car, calm as you like. One Two, starts the
     engine, but he can't find reverse. There is a crunching
     sound from the car, the accountants stop and look round.
     One Two puts down the window.

                professional.

     There is a pause while Uri is slightly lost for words. Then
     he slams the table in excitement and looks up at Victor who
     is standing in the distance.

               security problems and to cut a long
               story short, I need another seven
               million Euros lost in the books.

     Lenny walks into the warehouse where we see TWO SLOANES (posh
     kids, 20s) strapped to a pair of chairs with weights on the
     bottom. There are large leather belts wrapped around them.

                             LENNY COLE
               Right, I am going to tell you how
               this works. You're going in the
               drink and I am going to make a cup
               of tea.

     Archy grabs a hook attached to an electric winch and attaches
     it to their leather belts.

               Underneath the floor boards is the
               famous river Thames. I hope for
               your sakes you can hold your breath
               for as long as it takes to boil that
               kettle. After that, I am going to
               ask you a question, one question.
               You are going to give me a name and
               if it's the right name, I send you
               home warm and dry in a fresh set of
               clothes. If it's the wrong name,
               you'll be fed to the cray fish,....see

     He presses the green button and a hatch in the floor opens.
     The TWO SLOANES are lowered into the river protesting.

     Pause for a concerned thought from One Two.
                             ONE TWO
               I understand anything coming from

     WE CUT BACK TO TEN YEARS AGO. Cut to a shot of a 12 year
     old BOY with a cut under his eye singing "Bank Robber" by
     The Clash in to the mirror. He's wearing just his boxer
     shorts and enjoying himself, he's gonna be a rock star.
     From behind WE SEE his bedroom door open, but the music is
     to loud for the boy to have heard the entrance. We SEE Lenny,
     ten years younger entering, we can tell via the body language
     that he is irritated. He pauses then walks up suddenly
     slapping the boy very hard across the side of the face.
     It's enough to knock him out, the boy goes down - shot like
     a bullet out of a barrel. The red hand then slaps the stereo
     off.

                             LENNY COLE
               Listen to me boy, listen. I never
               did like you and neither did your
               real father. You're a reject, a
               wrong-un, a fuckin fairy in the mirror
               that I inherited from your mother,
               but she ain't with us no more, so
               now it's just you and me. In one
               week you go back to school, the best
               fuckin school in the country I might
               add, then you'll be gone for another
               term.

               In the mean time, show me some
               gratitude and keep the fuckin music
               down.

     He's still listening to "Bank Robber" dancing round with a
     couple of toy guns. His mate, who is not so posh, MEET PETE
     is sporting a balaclava at present. They've been cracking
     it up and the paraphernalia is everywhere.

     Johnny is standing in front of the mirror next to the mirror
     is the painting and oh he loves it. Pete rolls up his
     balaclava up and slams the stereo off.

                              JOHNNY STORY
                Just couldn't, it's got me,...that's

                You'd get a good few notes for that.
                Go on John, jog it on.

                You wouldn't understand.

                              PETE
                Why not?

     He does a quick moon walk, he's taking the piss.

     Rough old bar, there are a couple of OLD WASTERS staggering
     around in the distance. Johnny and Pete have now got drinks
     in their hands.

                              PETE
                My Dad made me watch Bonanza every
                Sunday after church.

                             PETE
               You think? It wasn't all bad, he
               sometimes made me laugh too.

                             JOHNNY STORY
               Now we're getting somewhere. Did he
               interfere with you? You know, touch
               you inappropriate like?

                             PETE
               He tickled me if that's what you
               mean.

                             JOHNNY STORY
               Now that's it! That's what I was
               looking for, you see your Dad is a
               monster Pedro, a tickling monster.
                   (singing)
               Pedro's dad's a tickling monster!

     Johnny helps himself to some WASTERS drink at the bar for a
     quick refreshment. Understandably, the WASTER doesn't look
     happy and his three FRIENDS don't look happy either.

                             WASTER
               That's my drink.

     Johnny gives the WASTER and his FRIENDS the masturbation
     signal without even bothering to look at them.

                             PETE
               Fuck you singalong, you're no help
               and stop calling me Pedro.

     The WASTER grabs a bottle from the bar ready to take some
     action. Johnny grabs a pencil from his top pocket, he holds
     it out like it's a knife. It's almost a joke.

                             JOHNNY STORY
               Come on boy, I'll have you and ya
               girlfriends! I'll do the lot of
               yazz.

     The WASTER is lost. Johnny is not physically scary, he's
     only scary because he's quite clearly mad. He looks like
     Robert Deniro in Taxi driver, mad as mars, he catches himself
     in the mirror, he likes what he sees. Ciggy falling out of
     his mouth, he sort of takes the piss out of himself, smiles
     "tough Johnny," the WASTER backs off he doesn't want junkie
     madness.

     Johnny sits back down next to Pete.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
               Did your Dad do anything else to you
               Pete?

               He hit me bad as well the slag.        Hit
               with a chain.

     Pete starts to lift up his shirt.

                              JOHNNY STORY
                    (Johnny stands)
               What are you doing? I'm not going
               to tickle you Pete, I'm not your
               Dad.

     He looks over and see's Pete has got the most horrific scars
     on his back. Johnny notice's them and stops in his tracks.
     Johnny walks back over to Pete and very tenderly touches his
     back, it feels horrible and bobbled.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                   (soft)
               I find that profoundly offensive
               Pedro. Two's up on a snout to show
               I care.

     He pulls out a ciggy.     Pete takes it.

                              PETE
               I used to think it had something to
               do with Bonanza.

                              JOHNNY STORY
               Your dad was jealous. Cos you dad
               isn't sure he's your dad, cos you
               don't look like him.

                              PETE

     One Two walks into the speeler, he looks like a lost man.
     He looks over at the guys sitting around talking, they stop
     and look up.

                             COOKIE
               Where have you been? You were missed
               in court today. That's not very
               compassionate is it, didn't turn up
               for your amigos funeral.

     The phone rings in the back ground, Dolly answers it.

                             FRED THE HEAD
               Everybody else was there but you and
               I got the feeling you were the only
               person Handsome wanted to see.

     One Two turns a little nasty.

                             ONE TWO
               What are you trying to say Fred?

                             FRED THE HEAD
               Eh?

                             ONE TWO
               You wanna have it out now?

     From behind we see Handsome Bob and Mumbles walk into the
     Speeler. Handsome Bob sneaks up and put his hands over One
     Twos eyes.

                             HANDSOME BOB
               Guess whoooo?

     One Two spins round in major shock, he see's Bob and he
     doesn't like it. All the boys look on like One Two's going
     to hug him. He doesn't.

                             HANDSOME BOB (CONT'D)
               The prosecution lost the paper work.
               I am offski, the case is closed.

                             ONE TWO
                   (in shock)
               Five years, you were supposed to
               get five fucking years!

     Everyone's in shock.    Dolly walks over and interrupts.

                Well thank you Uri, that's a real
                compliment from a man that obviously
                takes good care of himself.

                             URI
                I suppose you're wondering why you
                are here?

                I assume you want to check that
                everything is still "kosher" at my
                end.
                     (pause)
                I was a little surprised you didn't
                come through at the appropriate time,
                but I reckon you have your reasons.
     Silence.

                I assume everything is still as you
                say,...Kosher?

     Pause. Lenny milks the moment and after a few seconds of
     mock thought, he speaks.

                             LENNY COLE
                Don't you worry Uri, that one's on
                me,...partners and all that, but I
                wouldn't like it to go south again,
                makes things difficult, if you know
                what I mean?

                             URI
                I understand Lenny and I wouldn't
                like things to go wrong either.
                Which brings me conveniently to my
                next point. Ever since the painting,
                my lucky painting, hasn't been hanging
                on my wall, things have not
                been,....so lucky. I know this is a
                rude request because we have not
                concluded our business, but I feel
                as though I need it.

     Long pause while Lenny scrambles for an excuse.

      We CUT TO Mumbles on the sofa who is watching One Two, he         
      grimaces. Bertie is next to him.

      Mumbles smiles and flicks his cigar ash into Bertie's glass.
      He knows he's a poof and keeps his eyes on him a second too
      long just to get Bertie excited.

      CUT TO One two who has just run into Stella, there is a man
      holding a tray of drinks next to them.

                   Am I a dancer? Shall we put the
                   record straight?

      One Two makes room in front of him and starts to dance
      relativity badly. You get the feeling he probably could
      dance, but he just can't be bothered to make an effort.

                                  ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                   You see it's all in the genes.

                   My Dad was a dancer and his Dad before
                   that so gradually it's percolated

                   So, I hear you have a secret, but
                   you look like you might have more
                   than one. Why don't you confess?

                               BERTIE
                   I don't want to talk about work.

                   we will talk about whatever you want
                   to, anyway, you don't have to tell
                   me anything. If he's an informer

      Johnny is watching cartoons trying to skin up a joint using
      a page of a book, he puts it down in frustration. Pete walks
      in, grabs the picture from it's place and starts to walk
      out. Johnny squints.

      Johnny walks in and approaches the BARMAN.        He doesn't like
      Johnny.

                  Now, now no need for that tone bar
                  steward. I am merely on mission to
                  acquire a shot of your finest Scotch
                  and a packet of your,...

                  King size of course - along with a
                  packet of your shiniest coffin nails.

     The BARMAN reaches for a pack of cigarettes.

                              BARMAN
                  Don't make a scene in here boy.

     Johnny puts a large note on the bar.

                  Put the change in the blind box my

     He leans into the bar and shuts one eye.

                  one eyed man is king"

     The BARMAN is left with his mouth open. Johnny walks to the
     piano to drink his Scotch. There are a few beer mats on the
     piano, Johnny wipes the mats off with a glide of his hand
     and they fall to the floor. He raises the lid, coughs,
     composes himself, and extends his hands through his sleeves.
     He hits the first note and takes his scotch down in one. A
     few of the old PUNTERS turn around. Johnny starts to play
     the most beautiful classical music with his eyes shut. Pete
     walks in, approaches Johnny and sits with him. He likes it
     when he plays. Johnny doesn't even need to see him to know
     that he's there.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                  You see that pack of Virginia killing

      Pete picks up the pack as Johnny keeps his eyes shut. The
      following story is a montage of pack shots of the cigarette
      box, intercut with Johnny's delicate fingers stroking the
      keys.

                You will notice that one of your
                personalities is seduced by the
                illusions of grandeur. A "gold"
                packet of "king" size and with a
                "regal" insignia. An attractive
                implication toward glamour and wealth,
                a subtle suggestion that cigarettes
                are indeed your "royal" and loyal
                friends. And that Pete,...is a lie.
                    (beat)
                Your other personality is trying to
                draw your attention to the flip side
                of the discussion. Written in boring,
                bold, black and white is the
                statement, that these neat little
                soldiers of death, are in fact, trying
                to "kill you." And that Pete,...is
                the truth.
                    (beat)
                Beauty is a beguiling call to death
                and I am addicted to the sweet siren
                of its pitch. And that,..is why,..you
                and I love the crack, and that is
                also why I can not,.. give that
                painting back.

      He opens his eyes and looks at Pete, his cigarette has gone
      out.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                Now, please pass me a light.

      Johnny smiles and puts him in a head lock, they fall to the
      floor wrestling.

     There is a long line of people outside Roman and Mickey's
     venue. Johnny and Pete hustle their way through the crowd,
     the BOUNCER pulls them up.

                             BOUNCER
               Oi you, what do you think you're

               Run along junkies.

                             JOHNNY STORY
               Oi looky, but no touchy.

     Johnny pushes the BOUNCERS arm away. The BOUNCER retorts
     with a slap round the cheek. Pete won't stand for that, he
     goes for the BOUNCER in a pathetic junkie way.

                             PETE
               Get off him you slag, he's class.

     The BOUNCER smashes a big bouncer punch right on Pete's nose.
     Pete shoots back past Johnny and lays in the road, the line
     starts clapping.

     swings   into the ether

92   INT. RANGE ROVER                                                   92

     We SEE inside the Range Rover where there is a DRIVER with
     our TWO CHECHNYANS. The CHECHNYANS have suitcases handcuffed
     to their wrists. They speak in their native tongue.

                             CHECHNYAN 1
               Victor is Uri's right hand man, we
               served together for four years in
               Chechnya. We used to have a good
               time together, he's a real soldier,
               strong, hard, we made much trouble.
               I saved his life and he saved mine
               many times,...

     CHECHNYAN 1 pulls up his sleeve to reveal a massive tattoo.
     His arm is filled with slash marks on it.
                             CHECHNYAN 1 (CONT'D)
               Caught in tank tracks!      He pulled me
               out and this one,...

     He unbuckles his trousers and shows a massive gouge in his
     thigh.

                             CHECHNYAN 1 (CONT'D)
               Stem grenade.

                             CHECHNYAN 2
               I have one of those,...

     CHECHNYAN 2 pulls up his trouser leg to reveal massive scars
     on his shin.

                             CHECHNYAN 2 (CONT'D)
               How many of these have you got?

       Chechnyan 1 pulls his shirt up to reveal more wounds.

       SMASH!!!! Their car is smashed into a tailspin, by Handsome
       Bob's truck. The Range Rover eventually lands on it's side,
       steam, spinning wheels, smoke, and glass is everywhere.

      Bob jumps out of his truck and runs down to the second getaway
      car waiting. We SEE One Two and Mumbles get out of their
      car and run over to the Range Rover on its side, they are
      carrying an axe and bolt cutters. Inside, CHECHNYAN 2 slowly
      opens his dazed eyes, to SEE an axe chopping through the
      window. TWO CHOPS and the window gives in. One Two leans
      in and grabs the case, but it's chained to CHECHNYAN 2's
      wrist. One Two pulls the arm out of the window and Mumbles
      uses massive bolt cutters to cut the case free.

                              MUMBLES
                There's another case, grab it.

      One Two leans in and grabs the second case from Chechnyan 1.
      As he is about to chop this one loose, he is pulled into the
      car by CHECHNYAN 2.

                              ONE TWO
                The bastard's still kicking.     Mace
                him, mace him!

      Mumbles quickly moves around to the other window and sprays
      mace everywhere, including into One Two's eyes.

                              ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, not me you idiot,
                the Guerrilla!

      CHECHNYAN 2 in the mean time has regained some of his strength
      and is still pulling One Two into the car with him. We can
      SEE Bob in the distance now next to their second getaway car
      looking concerned.

                              ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                Shoot him, shoot him, the bastards
                going to eat me!
      Mumbles pulls out a revolver, sticks it in the window and
      fires it into CHECHNYAN 2's leg. This just aggravates the
      CHECHNYAN.

      Bang.

                   Arhhhhhhhhhhh.     That's my fuckin
                   arm!

      One Two manages to head butt CHECHNYAN 2 and goes back to
      reclaiming the case from CHECHNYAN 1. He pulls it out and
      Mumbles cuts the chain. One Two can't see a thing.

                                  MUMBLES
                   Let's go, we've got it.

                                  ONE TWO
                   Give me a hand, you've blinded me!
      Major confusion is setting in. They run back to their car,
      which is still running, Mumbles shoves One Two into the back
      and jumps in the drivers seat.

                                  ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                   Go, go, go, go!!!!!!

      With his window open, Mumbles wheel spins out of the situation
      and turns to check on One Two. From out of nowhere a very
      large CHECHNYAN arm shoots through the window and puts Mumbles
      in a neck lock. The CHECHNYAN 2 is holding on and not letting
      go.

      The car tears across the road and enters a shop window that
      has a mezzanine. The car comes to a halt on a precarious
      ledge, it's dangling with the CHECHNYAN 2 still not letting
      go.

                   Give me the gun.

      One Two can get a clear shot into the CHECHNYAN 2's side.
      He shots him once, CHECHNYAN 2 doesn't move, twice, three
      times, four times, he finally lets go and falls down on the
      floor.

                                  ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                   Shit, what are these two made out
                   of?

      Mumbles is coughing and slowly coming back to life.

               Who's got the cases?

                             MUMBLES
               I've got 'em.

     As they get out of the car, WE SEE CHECHNYAN 1 has now made
     his way down the street. He is punch drunk with mace in his
     eyes, but extracts a machine gun from under his jacket. The
     boys freeze they are fucked, nowhere to go, but CHECHNYAN 1
     is blinking profusely he can't be sure where they are. He
     lets off a magazine into the manikins next to our boys who
     all hit the deck. The magazine runs dry, CHECHNYAN 1 dips
     into his belt to extract a fresh one. Mumbles see's his
     opportunity, he grabs a golf club that is standing next to
     him, runs at CHECHNYAN 1 and takes a massive swipe at his
     head. CHECHNYAN 1 goes down, but he has already put in a
     new magazine. Mumbles is still carrying the cases, One Two
     is attached to his arm.

                             ONE TWO
               Shoot him Mumbles or we won't get
               out of this!

                             MUMBLES
               I can't fuckin shoot him, you do it.

     A baseball smashes into Mumbles face, he goes down, and he's
     out. CHECHNYAN 2 has appeared carrying a metal baseball
     bat. One Two picks up the machine gun.

                             ONE TWO
               Stop or I'll shoot!

     CHECHNYAN 2 will not stop, he just keeps on coming.

                             ONE TWO (CONT'D)
               I mean it, get down,...get down!

     CHECHNYAN 2 keeps coming, One Two doesn't want to do it but
     he has to. He lets off twenty three bullets into the
     CHECHNYAN 2's chest, the CHECHNYAN is knocked back and
     disappears over the mezzanine. One Two is in shock, he has
     never killed a man. He stands there numb.

     It pulls up and the boys pile in, what's left of them. They
     pull away from the sports shop.

     Bob looks in his mirror, he can see a gun being raised, there
     is someone on the trunk.

                              HANDSOME BOB
               Down.

     He slams on the brakes. CHECHNYAN 2 goes flying over the
     roof, but stops himself hitting the road by perforating the
     hood with his massive knife. He proceeds to perforate the
     wind screen with another knife that he extracts and (because
     of laminate) starts to saw through the wind screen. The
     boys are in horror.

                              HANDSOME BOB (CONT'D)

     One Two gets caught in a head lock by CHECHNYAN 2, they
     struggle. Mumbles hits the CHECHNYAN from behind with a car
     Jack and CHECHNYAN 2 goes down again. One Two's eyes have
     just about come back.
                              ONE TWO
               Run!     Run for your lives.

     The crew split in DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. Bob takes the cases
     and plucks some poor bystander out of their car and takes
     off. Mumbles disappears another way. CHECHNYAN 2 is up and
     follows One Two - terminator style, a foot chase begins.
     One Two, split from the group and being pursued, jumps over
     a wall.

     One Two has ended up on a railway track. He turns back, why
     should CHECHNYAN 2 chase him, he hasn't got the money. But
     no, CHECHNYAN 2 is over the fence, bullet proof vest flapping
     in the wind, and coming after him. One Two finds his strength
     this is his world, the world of the runner - he's off down
     the tracks.

     The pair of them are bleeding profusely, they're bashed to a
     pulp, but they have still got a running sprit. The run goes
     on and on. CHECHNYAN 2 has ripped off his jacket, we can
     see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and
     sweat, he seems unstoppable. One Two gets confident and
     starts to run backwards egging CHECHNYAN 2 on, CHECHNYAN 2
     is a good runner, but not good enough. Deep hate fills his
     eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him, CHECHNYAN 2 will
     remember this man. One Two is taking complete liberties, he
     almost stops and waits until CHECHNYAN 2 has caught up to
     him and then he tears off, the CHECHNYAN keeps coming.

     One Two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from
     a distance, its CHECHNYAN 1 who completely out sizes the
     machine. However, he's moving and it's moving faster than
     One Two. One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the
     moped gets nearer. At least when he gets over the wall, the
     moped won't follow right? One Two's over. He can hear the
     moped on the other side, One Two looks over his shoulder he
     can see the moped being lifted over the wall. "Oh shit."
     This is where One Two's "zone" comes into play. He drifts
     in to a place that he can not be disturbed and he runs and
     runs and runs. Up, down, through and in.

     We see Mumbles has caught up with One Two along side the
     tracks. He is on a motorbike that he has stolen.

     One Two jumps on the back and they speed away leaving our

                  Archy lost the key to the   lock.
                  Didn't you Arch?

     Archy nods like an idiot.

      Uri concludes the meeting with Lenny and Archy and they walk
      to the exit where Turbo is waiting by the door. Something
      has obviously just happened.

                               LENNY COLE
                Something wrong with these immigrants
                Arch, I don't fuckin trust 'em.
                We're being set up, don't know how,
                but something's wrong, I can smell
                it with my sniffer. I thought he
                was made of fuckin money, not too
                happy about flashing it around here
                though is he?

                He is the only one that knows.

                               URI
                He doesn't have the balls or the

                He's a crook, a small time back
                handing crook. Once could be a
                coincidence, but twice and the

      One Two walks into the restaurant with Handsome Bob. One
      Two is bashed to a pulp, but he's wearing a nice suit and
      carrying a bag full of money. There is a slight silence as
      his appearance arrests conversations. Handsome waits near
      the entrance and One Two sits down across from Stella, there
      is a pause. The odd PERSON passes and double takes at One
      Two.

                 That is a rhetorical question I hope.

                 I know what happened, it's been all
                 over the news, but I didn't
                 realize,...

                               ONE TWO
                 You didn't say anything about guns,..
                 machine guns with war criminals stuck
                 to the trigger.
                               STELLA
                 I am sorry I didn't know, but
                 shouldn't you have taken precautions?

                               ONE TWO
                 I'll leave your bag under the table
                 all right?
                     (pause)
                 But this isn't about the money is
                 it? I saw you there on that last
                 job. At first I thought it was
                 curiosity,..

      CUT BACK TO THE ROBBERY we see Stella in her car that One
      Two had seen, but we didn't.

                               ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                 But then I realized what was going
                 on. You don't need the money, you
                 liked the rush. Your old man, can't
                 give you the action can he?

                 Sorry, I thought you might like some

      gone.

                 You've scared 'em off sing-a-long,

      Cookie cuts in.

                   comes with this painting,....

      Cookie gets up from the table and walks over.

                               COOKIE
                   I don't want the pitch, I said I'll
                   have it.

                               MALCOLM
                   It's a very rare and expensive
                   painting sir.

      Malcolm's upset, he wanted to give the pitch. Cookie pulls
      out a lot of money too much for Malcolm to say no to.

                   I'll have that painting in a couple
                   of days Uri, trust me on that.

      Uri's not sure about that last statement.

                   You like it out here Lenny?

                   cleared for us Lenny, we are not
                   going to be disturbed.

                   Oh that's good, I love a clear fair
                   way, that's a bitta me that Uri.
                   Nothing worse than being jogged on
                   by blind tourists swinging a stick
                   on a Sunday.

                   What are we going to do Lenny? Every

                   something dishonest happens.
                       (pause)
                   You, wouldn't know anything about
                   that, would you?

      Clearly shifting gears, could he be saying what he thinks.

                               LENNY COLE
                Broke my legs in four places Archy,
                did you hear that? The bastard's
                made me limp for the rest of my days.

                               ARCHY
                What do you want me to do?

      Lenny is clearly distressed, his confidence has gone.

                               LENNY COLE
                I need that picture Archy, I need it
                bad.

                               ARCHY
                I'll get it, don't you worry and I
                think I can do better than that.
      This catches his attention.

                               LENNY COLE
                What?

                               ARCHY
                Someone has been at the Russian's
                money, a couple of silly gun
                slingers,..he wasn't making up
                stories.

                               LENNY COLE
                What?

                               ARCHY
                You know 'em and you don't like 'em
                either.

                               LENNY COLE

      Stella walks out of the bathroom, she looks immaculate.

                               ONE TWO
                Look at you, good as new.

                I'll take you up on that.

                              ONE TWO
                I got something for you. Thought
                you might like it, seeing as you
                like paintings and all.
                    (he motions)
                There, it's on floor.

      Leant up against the wall is the lucky painting, she stops
      and looks at it, the camera slowly creeps into her face. We
      observe One Two looking for a reaction.

                              ONE TWO (CONT'D)
                Like it?
                              STELLA
                You have very good taste,...Mr One

      She picks up the painting and turns smiling.

                              STELLA (CONT'D)
                Good bye.

      With that she is off and out the door. One Two grabs the
      70s retro headphones above his head and slaps them on his
      ears. He presses the remote control and the music kicks in.

118   EXT. CRACK HOUSE                                                118

      Mickey and Roman approach the crack house door and flick up
      the letter box. They see a string hanging, they pull it and
      down comes a key.

119   INT. CRACK HOUSE                                                119

      Roman and Mickey walk in to see Johnny slouched and watching
      TV, more silly cartoons. He's got his top off and he's
      smoking a ciggy. His feet are resting on an old chair and
      Pete is asleep next to him. Johnny hardly moves.

                              ROMAN
                So why did you call Johnny?

                              JOHNNY STORY
                Sorry, Johnny's not home right now,
                but the pipe is and the pipe says
                that Johnny heard you were getting
                in trouble boys.

      Roman gives a slight roll of the eyes.

                   Look, whoever I am talking to please
                   relay the message to Johnny. His
                   Dad, his jack in the box surprise
                   gangster Daddy, paid us a visit.
                   Shut down a few of our venues and he
                   intends to shut down a few more unless
                   Mr Story puts in an appearance.

                               JOHNNY STORY
                   Why are you talking to a pipe Roman?
                   You're madder than I am.

                               MICKEY
                   Come back Johnny, come back home.

                   But home is where your head is and I

                       (beat)
                   Come back Johnny!

      Johnny smiles and pulls out a gun from under his arse. He
      points it at Roman, waits until he knows they feel it and
      pulls the trigger.

      It's a lighter. He relights his splif, hot hash dropping on
      his chest, he ignores it.

                               JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                   I bet our Lenny gave you the "I'm

                       (impersonating Lenny)
                   I've seen jelly fish with closer DNA
                   than that slag. Now Johnny will
                   come quietly, but you might have a
                   couple of problems with the pipe.
                       (he sighs)
                   Come on boys, buy us both a cup of
                   tea. No need for any noise, let
                   Pete sleep on.

120   INT. ONE TWO'S HOUSE                                              120

      One Two has still got the headphones on, his eyes shut and
      he's tapping his knees. All of a sudden the music stops
      coming out of the headset and is now filling the room, someone
      else is here.

                young and only one thing will stop
                him from reaching his goals,...women.
                And this woman has become a problem.

                don't like her or trust her and I
                want you to follow that snake.

      We reveal it's CHECHNYAN 1 our war criminal who is looking
      battered from the beating the day before.

122   EXT. RESTAURANT       - FLASH BACK                              122

      We go back to the scene at the restaurant from a different
      perspective. The two CHECHNYAN'S see One Two and Handsome
      Bob walk out of the restaurant, they two look at one another,
      their brows steel.

123   INT. ONE TWO'S HOUSE                                            123

      CUT BACK to present with the music being cut off from One
      Two's head phones. He opens his eyes, on his throat lies a
      very long and sharp knife. The two CHECHNYANS have entered
      the room and pulled the wire out of the machine. CHECHNYAN
      1 is sitting on a chair next to One Two, he's the one with
      the blade. He smiles, One Two doesn't.

124   EXT. ONE TWO'S HOUSE                                            124

      Archy approaches the door with Danny behind, he pushes it,
      it opens. Concerned, he pulls out a shooter, so does Danny,
      they go in.

125   INT. ONE TWO'S HOUSE                                            125

      The music is very loud, it's Russian. Archy and Danny make
      their way to it's source, up the stairs, to the bedroom door.
      The base thumps out. Archy tries the handle, it turns, he
      pushes the door open slowly. The music becomes clear as we
      reveal a horrible scene. Archy is shocked, but a little
      amused.

      Tied to the bed, back to front with a pillow over his head
      is One Two. A large blade is resting on his back, a bottle
      of vodka is open on the side, One Two cries and wriggles
      uselessly.

      naked Chechnyan doing a traditional Chechnyan dance, which

      He is wearing military speedos and fuck all else apart from
      his military hat. He is "having much fun." His massive
      frame is still black and blue from the beating One Two
      previously inflicted. The other Chechnyan (similarly
      dressed), is digging into his bag of tools, extracting all
      sorts of horrible looking things. Archy looks on amazed by
      the show, he has a quick look at Danny who is also bemused.
      He hits the "off" button, the Chechnyans spin, looking
      distressed. Silence ensues.

                               JOHNNY STORY
                Hello Archy.
                               ARCHY
                Johnny, you do look the part.

                               JOHNNY STORY
                Show us your guns Uncle Arch, I told
                the boys all about it.

                               ARCHY
                Shut up and get in the car.

      Archy throws Johnny a packet of rolos and turns to get in
      the car. As he turns, Johnny lifts up the back of his sports
      jacket and steals his gun. The two FRIENDS are in shock,
      needless to say so is Archy. Johnny holds it on his two
      friends.

                               JOHNNY STORY
                Give us your money boys.
      Archy grabs the gun and hits Johnny on the back of the head,
      not too hard.

                               ARCHY
                You little swine,... now get in the
                car.

      Archy puts the gun away and looks at the two shocked school
      friends. He gently slaps them on the cheek in an intimidating
      way and gives them a tener.

                               ARCHY (CONT'D)
                Be good boys, you never know who's
                watching.

      Lenny's in a wheelchair, he looks at Bandy.

                               LENNY COLE
                   Come here Bandy.

      Bandy comes near, Lenny takes a sniff.

                               LENNY COLE (CONT'D)
                   You been drinking again?

      Lenny slaps him.

                   Think before you drink and before
                   you drive me mad Bandy.

      Bandy goes back to his position of pushing the boss towards
      the elevator.

      Johnny, Roman and Mickey walk toward the entrance.

                   nervous about, some of my Dad's best
                   friends ended up here.

      Archy arrives with a couple of old carpets, One Two, Mumbles
      and Handsome Bob are wrapped inside.

                               JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                   Hello Arch, wrapped up in a carpet

                   Still full of hot air Johnny.

      Archy presses a button to call the elevator.       They wait.

                   I don't want to hear it.

      Archy's getting wound up.

                              ARCHY
                Shut it, otherwise you will get hurt.

      His face has been slapped into the direction of Roman and
      Mickey. Johnny keeps his head still,...

                              JOHNNY STORY
                That, Roman and Mickey, is the famous

                transported straight back to my
                childhood.

      He speaks next in a little boys voice, he's taking the piss.

                Don't turn Archy in, he's your friend,
                he's loyal, just like the dog.

      He changes to impersonate Lenny, its deep and over the top.

                              JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D)
                Shut up boy, don't stick your nose
                where it don't belong otherwise I'll
                chop it off.
                    (little boy voice)
                But you can't do it to Uncle Arch, I
                love him.

                little time inside to remember who
                the boss is.

      Archy straightens his tie to remain calm, but can't take it
      any longer. He picks Johnny up and slams him against the
      wall.

      Archy drops him, his wires crossed.        He needs a little time
      to think.

      Johnny is off out of the elevator walking away happy as a
      clam. Back to Archy in the elevator.

      There is a pause while Lenny considers just shooting him.
      He changes his tone, he gets serious and slow.

      Two, Handsome Bob, and Mumbles observe.

      BANG! Lenny shoots Johnny in the hip with a gun he has kept

                   was it now Daddy. If you want to
                   shut me up it should have been a bit
                   higher.

      Lenny looks up to Danny.

      Danny takes Roman, Mickey and Johnny out towards the elevator.

                              LENNY COLE (CONT'D)
                You don't know how much trouble you
                have caused me so please understand
                that I will kill you very slowly if
                you do not tell me where my money
                is.

                              HANDSOME BOB
                The address is in my top pocket.
                Here, Archy,...you know I wouldn't
                mess you around.

      Lenny is out of reach of them, Archy can tell Handsome Bob
      is implying something.

                              HANDSOME BOB (CONT'D)
                Take it Arch.

      Archy leans forward to take it,      Lenny interrupts wheeling
      himself over.

                              LENNY COLE
                Let me have a look first.

      He takes the letters out of Handsome Bob's top pocket and
      opens them up. He squints, the print is too small he can't
      read what it says.

                              ARCHY
                Here you can't read it without your
                glasses, let me have a look.

      Lenny looks uncomfortable, Archy almost snatches the letters
      and flicks through the pages. He reads to himself, could it
      be true? Could Lenny be the informer sending everyone around
      him down?

                              LENNY COLE
                What does it say?      Hurry,...

      Mickey and Roman are holding Johnny up, he's bleeding all
      over the place. Danny is facing front while another MAN is
      keeping an eye on them. We SEE, but the other's don't, Danny
      is slowly screwing on a silencer.

                    (beat)
                And then, since Danny is obviously
                going to kill you two as well,...

      WE SEE the imaginary shots from Danny's gun go off on Mickey
      and Roman.

                The only evidence that will ever
                remain of this deal is that form of

                   You're a dirty bastard Sidney, a
                   very dirty bastard.

      Archy grabs the belt that's used to tie up drowning victims,
      he throws it round Lenny's chair and stuffs a bit of cloth
      into Lenny's wide open mouth.

                   out of here,...

      Archy throws a knife across to Mumbles who just catches it
      and starts to cut his way out of the ropes. Archy gets back
      on with the job at hand. He reads through the names Lenny
      has grassed on over the years.

      Archy grabs the winch that lowers victims to their crayfish

                But now Danny's rattled, he won't be
                able to wait because you now know
                what's coming, so he's gonna fire.

      Danny, who is now in a state because Johnny has predicted
      everything he's going to do, suddenly turns with his gun.
      Mickey catches it, the force of the stop pulls the trigger,
      and the other MANS head is drilled through. Roman joins the
      wrestling match and gets the gun and wrist to aim at Danny's
      head. The trigger gets squeezed and Danny's head also gets
      a drilling. Silence. Johnny, who is smothered in blood,
      speaks coolly.

                Mickey, pass me the gun.

                Dannys hand. Don't worry he can't
                defend himself he doesn't have a
                head, quickly now. Does this answer
                the question that you two so
                frequently asked as to why I sought
                refuge in the depths and perverse
                beauty of the crack pipe?

                               BANDY
                   Get fucking down!

      He looks on in horror and points the gun at Johnny. Just as
      he's about to fire,..there is a great smash of bone on timber.
      Bandy falls to reveal One Two standing there with a large
      piece of timber.

                               ONE TWO
                   I think we should get out of here
                   now, don't you John?

      At which point in the background WE SEE Lenny being lowered
      to his demise. He looks at the group in horror as he is
      quickly lowered to his death by drowning and cray fish.
      FADE OUT.

                               VICTOR
                   I don't like it Uri, I don't trust
                   her. I put two of my people on her
                   and they haven't come back.

      Very insulted.

                               URI
                   You what? I did not tell you to do
                   this. If I had wanted her spied on
                   I would have asked for it, wouldn't
                   I?

                               VICTOR
                   Yes Uri, you would have, but I still
                   don't like it.

                               URI
                   I don't care what you like Victor, I
                   am in charge, now wait here.

      He gets out and walks to the door.

      She answers the door - she is surprised.

                               URI
                   Can I come in?

                Sorry to surprise you, but I have
                something for you, a token of my
                appreciation.

      He hands her a check.

                               STELLA
                   What is this for?

                               URI
                   Please do not be insulted, you have
                   come to mean a lot to me and I value
                   you much more than just your services.
                       (pause)
                   This is simply a reflection of my
                   appreciation.
                       (vulnerable he likes
                        her)
                   I would like to ask you something
                   personal.

      His phone rings, he frowns slightly and answers it.

                               URI (CONT'D)
                   Not now Victor, I am busy.

      Uri turns. There, casually resting on the floor is his
      painting, his lucky painting. Uri's expression changes, his
      world has been shattered, he's thinking very ugly thoughts.
      He turns back to Stella, dead pan.

                               URI (CONT'D)
                   A very nice painting. How long have
                   you had it?

      A little caught off guard.

                               STELLA
                   Years, it's my lucky painting,...
                   it's very special isn't it?

                               URI
                   Beauty is a cruel mistress, is it
                   not?

      Pause, she smiles. Uri talks back into the phone, the other
      darker Uri is now in charge.

                               URI (CONT'D)
                   Victor please, come to join us.
