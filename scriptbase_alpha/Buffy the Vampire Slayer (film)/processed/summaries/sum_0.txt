Buffy Summers has the lifestyle any young woman could want.
Cheerleading, dating the captain of the basketball team, and copious amounts of time spent shopping with friends.
She had no idea of her true calling until a mysterious man named Merrick approached her and told her that she is the Slayer; one woman called to defend the world from vampires.
Reluctant to concede to the fact, Buffy soon learns that Merrick speaks the truth and so begins to take her new life seriously while trying to maintain the sense of normality her life had once been.
With her best friends slowly abandoning her, Buffy finds solace in the town outcast, Pike, who knows very well the terrors that have arisen.
Together, they combat the forces of the old and powerful vampire, Lothos, who has his eyes set on Buffy.
