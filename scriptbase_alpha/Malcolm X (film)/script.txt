     FADE IN:
 
1       EXT. ROXBURY STREET - THE WAR YEARS - DAY 

     It is a bright sunny day on a crowded street on the black side of 
     Boston. PEOPLE and KIDS are busy with their own things. 

     SHORTY bops his way down the street. He is a runty, very dark 
     young man of 21 with a mission and a smile on his face. He wears 
     the flamboyant style of the time: the whole zoot-suit, pegged legs 
     and a wide brim hat with a white feather stuck in the hat band.

5      EXT. STREET - DAY 

     FOLLOW SHOT. Shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages. 
     His smile is one of anticipation. He nods to a PAL without 
     stopping; eyes a COUPLE OF CHICKS dancing on the street, but is 
     not dissuaded.
 
6     INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY 

     Shorty has his jacket and hat off, his sleeves rolled up. He is like a 
     surgeon preparing for an operation. His equipment is spread out on 
     a table: can of lye, large mason jar, wooden stirring spoon, knife, 
     the eggs. His actions have the character of a ritual: each thing 
     being done just so, in time-honored fashion.

     He slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar.
     He adds water and makes a paste of the starch.

     Behind Shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation. ONE MAN is
      getting a haircut; TWO OTHERS are watching (TOOMER, JASON)
     one of them from behind a newspaper. A middle-aged barber, 
     CHOLLY, is doing most of the talking.
 
                    CHOLLY 
          After I hit the number that woman wasn't no good 
          to me at all.
 
     The men laugh.
 
     ANGLE - Shorty pries open the can of lye, whiffs it. It's good and 
     strong. He pours some in the mason jar, stirring with the wooden 
     spoon. He cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs. He waits as 
     fumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot.
 
     ANOTHER ANGLE - The barbershop SEEN from a door, slightly 
     ajar. A woolly head, entirely in shadow, peers out. 

                    CHOLLY'S VOICE 
          She says I'm cheap cuz I won't cop her a diamond 
          ring. Had the indignation to call me a cheap 
          black sunovabitch to boot.

                    TOOMER 
          And when a black woman call you a cheap black 
          sunovabitch you've been called a cheap black 
          sunovabitch.
 
     Cholly is annoyed. It's _his_ story. 

                    CHOLLY 
          Will you let me tell it?

     ON SHORTY - He opens the bulky package he has been carrying, 
     unfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it. Now he dons a pair of
      rubber gloves.

                    SHORTY 
          Where's Homeboy?

     He is all ready; one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of 
     Vaseline. His manner is indignant as if he were asking the whereabouts 
     of an exasperating child.
 
                    CHOLLY 
          Red's in the head, man.
 
                    TOOMER 
          You mean hiding in the head.
 
                    CHOLLY 
          Hey, Red. Your man's here and waiting on you. 

     His hands full, Cholly opens the door with his feet and MALCOLM comes 
     out, a big, gawky, bright-faced country boy, wearing downhome clothes 
     and an expression of apprehension.
 
                    TOOMER 
          Gonna get that first conk laid on, hunh, 
          Homeboy?
 
                    CHOLLY 
          Man, don't scare him more than he's scared 
          already. Ain't too bad...
 
     Malcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair, where Cholly drapes 
     him with a double sheet, tucking it tightly around his neck and adding 
     a protective collar of paper.
 
                    CHOLLY
     ...Like anything else. First time a chick gets her 
     cherry popped, she might put up a little fight. But 
     pretty soon you can't give her enough. Right, 
     Homeboy?
 
     CLOSE - MALCOLM 

     Malcolm gulps, his eyes on the fuming mason jar. 

     Shorty starts massaging a great quantity of Vaseline into Malcolm's 
     scalp, covering his neck and ears as well. All the men have gathered
      around, involved in the ritual. For Malcolm it is closer to being a 
     kind of execution.
 
                    CHOLLY 
          Git his forehead and eyebrows.
 
                    SHORTY 
          I know what I'm doing.
 
     Shorty applies the Vaseline to that area.  Now he brings over the
     steaming jar and places it nearby.

                    SHORTY (contd)
           Listen. You pull my coat if it's still stinging 
          when I get through 'cause this shit can burn a 
          hole through cement.
 
                    CHOLLY 
          Hold tight, baby, and keep your eyes shut.
 
     Malcolm nods his head, clenches his eyes and grits his teeth. Shorty 
     applies the congolene with a comb, working it into Malcolm's hair.

     CLOSE - MALCOLM 

                    MALCOLM
          I thought you said it was gonna sting... this 
          ain't nothin'.
 
     For a moment nothing happens, then the heat hits him. He yells, tries 
     to catch his breath: his head is on fire.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd)
          You motherfucker.  You're killing me. I'm 
          burning up. My damn head is on fire.

     He nearly leaps out of the chair, but the barber restrains him.

     Shorty, utterly unmoved by the outburst, continues working the 
     congolene into his hair. 

     Malcolm breaks out of the chair wildly. But the three men drag him to a 
     basin where Shorty has attached the shower spray. His cries filling the 
     room, Malcolm is ducked under the spray. Shorty starts rinsing out his 
     hair.
 
                    SHORTY 
          Don't fight me, man. Let me git it out.
 
     Malcolm is a little relieved, he tentatively opens his eyes, then he 
     feels the congolene again and there is another outburst. Shorty forces 
     his head under the spray, spurts the water all over his head, wetting 
     Malcolm and the shop in the process.

9       INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY
 
                    SHORTY 
          Well, Homeboy, you almost there. Turn around.
 
     Shorty is supervising as Malcolm tries on a zoot suit. He slips into 
     the jacket...
 
     Shoes-off, Malcolm steps into the tight-fltting peg-legged pants ......
      dons a wide-brimmed hat with a bright blue feather.... Finally, fully 
     outfitted, he leans forward toward his new image in the full-length 
     mirror, twirling a long, dangling key chain.
 
                         SHORTY 
          Well, all right, then.
 
                       MALCOLM 
          Well, all reet, then.
 
     The transformation is complete. The two laugh and slap hands. 

10     EXT. ROXBURY STREET - DAY
 
     Malcolm and Shorty come strutting down the street: two conked,
     zoot-suited sharpies. Hometown boy has departed. And the CHICKS on the 
     street notice them, especially Malcolm, the taller of the two, the 
     lighter-skinned, the more dominant. They walk imperiously past, fully 
     aware of their impact.
 
     CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM
 
     FREEZE FRAME. He becomes a STILL.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X 
          When my mother was pregnant with me, she told 
          me later, a party of Klansmen on horseback 
          surrounded our house in Omaha.

10A      ANGLE. KLAN on horses in front of house.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
          They brandished guns and shouted for my father 
          to come out. My mother went to the door where 
          they could see her pregnant condition... 

     ANGLE. A pregnant Louise Little on porch.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
          ...and told them my father was in Milwaukee, 
          preaching. 

     ANGLE. The Klan breaks all the windows in the house then rides off into 
     the glorious D.W. Griffith _Birth of a Nation_ moonlit night. 

     CLOSE - LOUISE LITTLE
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
          The hooded Klansman said the good, white 
          Christians would not stand for his 
          troublemaking, and to get out of town.
 
     ANGLE. The terrified Little children look out a broken window at their 
     mother.
 
     ANGLE. AN OLD FRAME HOUSE IN OMAHA
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
          They broke every window with their rifle butts 
          before riding off into the night, their torches 
          flaming.

     ANGLE. FRONT PORCH OF THE LITTLE HOUSE - AN EMPTY ROCKER ON IT
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
           My father was not a frightened Negro as most 
          were then and as many still are today. He was 
          six feet four and very black...
 
10B      CLOSE - EARL LITTLE

     He looks directly into the camera, wearing a Baptist Minister's robe.
 
                     VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
          ...and had a glass eye. He believed, as did 
          Marcus Garvey, that freedom, independence and 
          self-respect could never be achieved by the 
          Negro in America . . .
  
10C      CLOSE - EARL LITTLE
 
     He wears a Garvey hat, ornate with gold braid.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
          ...that, therefore, black men should leave 
          America and return to the land of their origin.
 
10D      ANGLE. Earl Little, in a wagon with little Malcolm.
 
     CLOSE - EARL LITTLE:
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
          My father dedicated his life to his beliefs 
          because he had seen four of his six brothers 
          die violently...
 
10E      WIDER ANGLE. WE SEE Earl in front of a podium in church. He is
     preaching.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
          ...three killed by white men and one lynched. 
          There are nine children in our family.
 
     ANGLE. The nine Little children. 

     CLOSE - LOUISE LITTLE 

     She is a pretty, mature woman and white-looking.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
          My mother was an attractive woman, an educated 
          woman, a strong woman.
 
10F CLOSE - LOUISE AND EARL
 
     A posed wedding picture, serious but sweet.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
          She was very light, her mama was raped by a 
          white man. One of the reasons she married my 
          father was because he was so black, she 
          disliked her complexion and wanted her children 
          to have some color.

15      INT. ROSELAND STATE BALLROOM - NIGHT
 
     CLOSE - MALCOLM AND SHORTY
 
     They both were posed for a picture. The music "FLYING HOME" is blaring 
     as LIONEL HAMPTON and his band is killing. The music is WILD, the
      dancing is frantic, the clothes are OUT, and the crowd is predominately 
     BLACK, although there is a peppering of WHITES, especially white chicks.
      And Malcolm is a little bug-eyed as he nudges Shorty, watching mixed 
     couples on the floor. 

     A BOY in extreme zoot-suit flips him; a WHITE GIRL in long blond
     hair wigs him. Malcolm is a little open-mouthed.
 
                    A VOICE 
          SHOWTIME, SHOWTIME!
 
     ANGLE - THE BALLROOM - NIGHT 

     People start moving off the floor, making room for the dancers. The 
     music begins to get faster and more furious. 

     CLOSE - HAMPTON'S BAND - NIGHT 

     It is a fast Lindy. People start clapping to the beat as they form a U 
     around the DANCERS, with the band at the open end.
 
16      INT. THE DANCE FLOOR
 
     TWO COUPLES are on the floor, dancing wildly. They are quickly joined 
     by a half dozen OTHERS. These are the best dancers and constitute the 
     main event of a Saturday night black dance. People crowd and push to 
     get better vantage points and the competition is under way.
 
     ANGLE ON THE CROWD 

     It is dominantly black, but there are some whites in the audience, 
     mostly women. One is SOPHIA, a spectacular blonde with a degree of
      refinement, something of a thrill-seeker. Many of the men try to catch 
     her eye, but for the moment Sophia is just watching, looking for no one 
     in particular, but nonetheless looking.
 
     ANGLE: - COUPLE ON THE DANCE FLOOR
 
     Getting ready to enter the fray, the GIRL takes off her shoes and 
     bounces out on the floor barefoot with her partner. Their advent is 
     greeted with cheers and ad libs. Clearly the crowd has its favorites. 

     WIDER SHOT

     The music gets faster and the dancing takes on a more frantic and more 
     remarkable quality. 

     FOLLOW SHOT - MALCOLM 

     He is looking for his partner, the girl he brought and now he sees her. 
     He makes his way through the watching audience. 

     CLOSE - LAURA 

     She is a fine chick, cool and beautiful. She smiles as she sees Malcolm 
     approaching.

     TWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm stand together, delighted to be with one 
     another, starting to move to the music, as they watch the dancers.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Come on, baby, let's show 'em how.
 
     Laura smiles shyly; she's willing.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          You better get out of them shoes, girl.
 
     Laura laughs, goes quickly to a bench and changes into a pair of 
     sneakers.
 
17      INT. THE DANCE FLOOR
 
     Because of the competition, Laura and Malcolm begin at high speed. In a 
     moment they are executing the most intricate steps of the "flapping 
     eagle" and the "kangaroo." Malcolm starts boosting her over and around 
     his hips, then boosting her over his shoulders. Laura is the perfect 
     partner. She loves it.
 
     ANGLE WITH THE CROWD
 
     So does the crowd, who loves new stars. There are ad lib remarks: "Go,
      man, go." "Hey, Red." "Mmmmmm ummm."
 
     ANGLE: - SHORTY
 
     A big, fat, hefty BLACK WOMAN takes Shorty out to the dance floor, and 
     she takes the lead. As they do the Lindy she is slinging Shorty around 
     like a rag doll. This woman slides him through her legs and Shorty has 
     had enough, he runs off the dance floor, and hides.
 
     TWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm are, in the phrase, cooking on all burners 
     now; and when they execute an especially intricate step, even Hamp 
     waves over.
 
     Malcolm is sweating and flushed and enormously elated. He sees that 
     people are watching him, goading him on. He notices that Sophia, in 
     particular, has not taken her eyes off him; she is clapping in time to 
     his steps.
 
     Seeing new stars in the making, the other dancers move to the side of 
     the floor, marking time, yielding the dance floor to them. Laura and 
     Malcolm go into a solo.
 
     ANGLES
 
     The crowd loves it. Malcolm and Sophia are very aware of each other. 
     The finale is the classic drag, with Laura hanging limp around 
     Malcolm's neck as he capers off the dance floor to the spontaneous 
     applause of the audience. 

     CLOSE SHOT - SOPHIA (SLO-MO) 

     Clapping enthusiastically -- in open admiration. 

     CLOSE SHOT - SHORTY
 
     Waiting to catch them as they come off. Shorty is whistling and shaking 
     his hand appreciatively. He is also looking out for his dance partner.
 
                    SHORTY 
          Hey, man, gimme some skin.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Shorty, this is Laura.
 
Laura is flushed and out of breath and joyous.
 
                    LAURA
          'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Now you come back.
  
     Laura laughs as she goes. She surely will be back.
 
                    SHORTY 
          That's a fine chick.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Fine as May wine.
 
                    SHORTY 
          Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
 
     Then his vision catches Sophia, who is approaching him. She makes a 
     simple, direct gesture, "Want to dance?" Malcolm eyes Shorty and 
     wordlessly glides into Sophia's arms.
 
     ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR
 
     Immediately from the glances of the other men at the dance, he is the 
     cynosure of all eyes. He has new status. It's a heady feeling because 
     she is the first white girl he has ever been with socially who is not 
     an obvious whore. He begins to show off a little, cuts a few fine 
     steps.
 
     TWO-SHOT. They are dancing closer than before. Sophia begins to rock 
     his black world. 

     CLOSE - MALCOLM 

     Trying to play it cool -- but he is beginning to pant. Not from the 
     dancing, but from the situation: a gorgeous white chick asking for
      it.
 
                    SOPHIA 
          Why don't you take your little girl home, Red, 
          and come on back?
 
     He stops in his tracks. He can't believe it.
 
                    SOPHIA (contd) 
          Just walk. Don't run. It'll be here when you 
          get back. 

     He can only grin.

18     EXT. LAURA'S HOUSE - ROXBURY - NIGHT 

     The porch of a respectable house. Malcolm with Laura; he anxious to get 
     away.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I better not come in.
  
                    LAURA
          I ain't stupid.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I mean it's late, baby.
 
                    LAURA
          I know where you're going.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need 
          my rest.
 
     Laura walks to the door.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
 
                    LAURA
          What for? I ain't white and I don't put out. 

     The front door opens, it's Laura's grandmother, MRS. JOHNSON.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          'Night, Mrs. Johnson.
 
     He runs down the porch steps.
 
19     INT. SOPHIA'S CAR - NIGHT
 
     The lone light emits from the car radio which plays The Inkspots' "IF I
      DIDN'T CARE."
 
     ANGLE - SOPHIA
 
     Sophia pulls her tight sweater over her head to expose two full ripe 
     white breasts. Malcolm's eyes are popping out of his head. NOTE: It's 
     very unusual for women not to wear a bra back in that day but you might 
     say Sophia was way ahead of her time.
 
                    SOPHIA
          Malcolm, look at them. Have you ever seen white 
          breasts like these?
 
     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
     He shakes his head.
 
                    SOPHIA (contd) 
          Put your black hands on them.
 
     He is paralyzed.

                    SOPHIA (contd) 
          Please do as I say.
 
     Malcolm mumbles something. He then kisses Sophia as if his black life 
     depended on it and he commences to kill it.
 
                    SOPHIA (contd) 
          Hey, baby.
 
      She stops him for a moment, but he buries his head in her long neck.
 
                    SOPHIA (contd) 
          Am I the first white woman you've been with? 

     She already knows the answer. He laughs.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
 
                    SOPHIA
          ...That isn't a whore?

     Knowing she's right, Sophia becomes the aggressor. 

     A beat -- both panting -- then Malcolm stops abruptly. He raises his 
     hand to his face, then to Sophia's hand which is still caressing him.
 
                    SOPHIA
          That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's 
          not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't 
          run.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
 
     CLOSE - SOPHIA

     She shrugs, then moves to embrace him.
 
                    SOPHIA 
          Who wants to talk? 

     The couple starts at it again. 

19A     INT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY
 
     On the screen, Bogart and Cagney are blasting away the dirty, flat-
     footed coppers with machine guns. It's one of those great Warner 
     Brothers gangster B movies, maybe _The Roaring Twenties_.
 
     ANGLE - MALCOLM AND SHORTY
  
     Malcolm and Shorty sit, transfixed in their seats.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
 
                    SHORTY 
          Eat lead, coppers.
 
80      EXT. BOSTON COMMONS - DAY
 
     A bright, sunny day, long shadows in the park. The Commons is almost 
     empty. Two improbable zoot-suited blacks race past trees, and run over 
     the grass. Malcolm and Shorty are playing Cops and Robbers while 
     PASSERSBY stare.
 
                    SHORTY 
          Bang, bang. You're dead.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for 
          size. 

     Malcolm fires an imaginary tommy machine gun at Shorty.
 
                    SHORTY 
          I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof 
          vest.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          The hell you are.
 
                    SHORTY 
          I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna 
          be Bogart sometimes.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          You're too small to be Bogart.
 
                    SHORTY 
          I'm not too short to be Cagney.
 
     Shorty shoots Malcolm from behind.
 
                    SHORTY (contd) 
          Pow. Take that.
 
     Malcolm acts as if he's been hit.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Ahhh! You got me, you dirty, filthy, rotten, 
          stinking copper, only a low-down yellow rat 
          bastard would shoot a man in the back.
 
     Malcolm starts to stagger, this is a long drawn out Hollywood drawn-out 
     death a la Cagney death in _Public Enemy_. 

     LOW ANGLE - MALCOLM
 
     Malcolm falls directly into the camera, face first, and Shorty stands 
     over him.
 
                    SHORTY 
          He use to be a big shot.

     Earl Little's face is in the same exact position as Malcolm's from the

     closer and closer to the black man lying on the tracks.
 
27      INT. A HEARING ROOM - DAY

29      INT. SOPHIA'S APARTMENT - MORNING
 
     Malcolm lies in bed, naked under the sheet. A half-empty whiskey bottle 
     and an ashtray full of butts are on the night table: last night's 
     partying.
 
                    SOPHIA
          You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          C'mere.
 
     WIDEN TO SHOW SOPHIA at the stove fixing eggs. She wears an apron and 
     nothing else. It's a nicely furnished middle-class apartment.
 
                    SOPHIA 
          Sweetie, they're almost ready.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          You hear me, girl?

     She shrugs, shuts off the burner, smiles and ambles toward him. 

                    SOPHIA 
          You the man. 

                    MALCOLM 
          You better believe it. 

     She starts to sit down on the bed next to him. 

                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Sit over there.

     He points to a nearby chair. Sophia makes an amiable hand-shrug and 
     complacently goes.

                    SOPHIA 
          You evil this morning. 

                    MALCOLM 
          What's your story, baby?
 
     He doesn't want to hear her; he wants to talk. He goes right on: 

                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          You one of them white bitches can't get enough 
          black dick. Is that what you are?

     Sophia smiles. She aims to please. Malcolm smacks the bed next to him. 
     She gets up and comes over.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Take it off.
 
     She takes off the apron.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Now kiss my feet. Kiss 'em!

                    MALCOLM 
          Feed me.
 
     ANGLE. Sophia now has the scrambled eggs on a plate at Malcolm's side. 
     She spoons some into his mouth. He chews and swallows slowly, then 
     grabs her head and brings it to his. A long, brutal kiss. Then he pulls 
     her head away by the hair. She looks at him: anything he wants.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna 
          holler "rape," sister?
 
                    SOPHIA
          Me?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          You will, baby -- if the time come.
 
                    SOPHIA 
          Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot. 

     Malcolm lays back on the pillow and she holds out the eggs to him.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Sure wish your mama and papa could see you now. 
          And that ofay you gonna marry. 

30     EXT. A BEACH - BRIGHT SUNLIGHT - DAY
 
     Malcolm and Laura are on a deserted Cape beach. They are dressed but 
     have their shoes and socks off, and he has his trousers rolled up. They 
     walk, like birds, avoiding getting their feet wet as the waves roll in.
 
                    LAURA
          Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got 
          class and you're smart.
 
                     MALCOLM 
          All them books you read and you still don't 
          know nuthin.
 
                    LAURA
          I do know I love you.

     Laura stops him and moves to him. Her kiss is a tender one, exploratory. 
     Then Malcolm responds, embracing her fully. Her arms go around him as 
     they both drop into the sand. 

     CLOSE - MALCOLM AND LAURA
 
                    LAURA
          Oh, Malcolm, I love you. Please, there's no one 
          around. Now?
 
     Malcolm turns his head from her, he gets up.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Let's go.
 
                    LAURA
          Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say 
          you're running around town with her.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Save it, baby. Save it for Mr. Right, 'cause 
          your grandma's smarter than ya think.
 
     She looks at him.
 
                    LAURA
          She raised me, my mother died when I was six.

          "Not For Sale" was a brand name.

34     INT. LITTLE KITCHEN - DAY

     are crowded around a portable radio in the galley where food is 
     prepared. The four stand around TULLY, a bland-faced personification of 
     fine Pullman service. They are all listening to the JOE LOUIS-BILLY 
     CONN heavyweight championship fight.
 
                    TULLY
          Nigger, shut up so we can hear.

          right to the jaw. Conn is staggering, but he 
          won't go down. Conn bops a left hook, he's 
          reeling around the ring. Louis hooks a left and 
          a right to the jaw and Conn is down. 

     The waiters are going crazy.

45     INT. A PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY 

     As Malcolm hefts his sandwich basket and a large container of coffee 
     down the aisle, hawking as he goes.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Get your good haaaam and cheeeeese sandwiches. 
          I got coffee, I got cake and I got ice cream 
          too. Right chere.
 
     ANGLE FAVORING A WHITE CUSTOMER, BLADES.

                    BLADES 
          Hey, boy. Gimme a cheese on white and coffee.
 
     Malcolm's mood is exuberant: the fight is still in his ears. He makes 
     the delivery with a flourish and a smile.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Yes, sir. Best in the house.
 
                    BLADES 
          You mighty pleased with yourself, boy.

          Yes, sir. I aims to please.
 
                    BLADES 
          I like you, boy.
 
45A     INSERT - FANTASY PROJECTION. Malcolm picks up a slab of cream pie and 
     pushes it in Blades' face. 

45B     BACK TO THE PASSENGER CAR 

     Normality again: Malcolm finishes serving him with complete servility. 
     He pulls out a bill.
 
                    BLADES 
          Keep the change.
 
     And takes a satisfying bite out of his thin sandwich. 

46     EXT. THE RAILROAD TRACKS IN HARLEM - P.M. 

     As the Clipper surfaces in Harlem, pulls up to the 125th Street 
     station.
 
47     EXT. 125TH STREET STATION - P.M.
 
     Malcolm, out of uniform and dressed in his zoot suit, comes down from 
     the Park Avenue station in Harlem. He is hit with the sights and sounds. 
     Everything delights him: the noise, the lights, the women, the pimps, 
     the signs, the windows, the crowds, the laughter, the music.

                    CROWD
          The Brown Bomber, The Brown Bomber, Joe Louis, 
          the heavyweight champion of the world. Joe got 
          the belt back. Lawd have mercy. Great day in 
          the morning.
  
50A     CLOSE - MALCOLM

     He runs after them.

50B      EXT. 125TH AND LENOX AVENUE
 
     All traffic has stopped, there is a huge spontaneous celebration going 
     on. Black folks are everywhere, it seems as if all of Harlem is out on 
     the streets. The citizens of Harlem are hugging, kissing, drinking, 
     dancing, folks are hanging from street lamps, yelling out their 
     windows, holding up hand-made JOE LOUIS banners, everyone has great 
     reason to be joyous. The heavyweight champion of the world is a BLACK 
     MAN -- JOE LOUIS, THE BROWN BOMBER, he has regained his championship.
 
     CLOSE: - MALCOLM
 
     Malcolm quickly looks at his watch, he's running late for his train, as 
     he fights his way through the crowd like a salmon going upstream, the 
     CAMERA CRANES up to see him eventually get lost in a sea of BLACK 
     HUMANITY "cutting loose."

FADE IN:
 
57     EXT. SEVENTH AVENUE - NIGHT
 
     Malcolm, newly conked and sharp as a tack (zoot suit, trouser crease 
     like a knife's edge, orange knob-toed shoes) walks toward his goal: 
     Small's Paradise.
 
     The street is crowded with PEOPLE, KIDS and HUSTLERS.
 
                    YOUNG HOOKER 
          Slow down, daddy, what's your hurry? Lemme show 
          you somepin brand new.
 
     Malcolm smiles "No thanks" keeps moving.
 
                    HUSTLER 
          Hey, man, hundred-dollar ring -- diamond; and a 
          ninety dollar watch. Take the both of them for 
          a quarter; twenty-five bucks.

      Malcolm waves; he's not having any. Goes on.

58     EXT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT
 
     Before entering, Malcolm sharps himself a bit, picking off some lint,
     cocking his hat. And enters.

59     INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT
 
     The restaurant is crowded, both at the bar and at the tables beyond.
     The immediate impression is of subdued well-being, of decorum, of easy 
     affluence. This is the world Malcolm wants into. He digs it, drinking 
     in its details.
 
     ANGLE - BAR

     A big man, FOX, accidentally bumps into Malcolm almost knocking over.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          The word is excuse me.
 
                    FOX 
          Look, country boy, you shouldn't have been in 
          my way.
 
     Everyone becomes quiet in the bar.
 
                    FOX (contd) 
          So what are you gonna do? Go run home to your 
          Mama.
 
     Malcolm grabs a bottle off the bar counter and with lightning speed
     brings it crashing down on Fox's head. As he lays on the floor with 
     head bleeding, Malcolm kicks him in the stomach _two times_. It's done,
      the fight is over and people pull him off of Fox.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Don't ever again in life step on my Florsheims 
          again, and never talk-bout my mother.
 
     ANGLE WITH MALCOLM AND THE BARTENDER
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Gimme a whiskey.
 
     BARTENDER pours him a double.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I ordered a single, Jack.
 
                    BARTENDER
          The double's on that gentleman. Jack!
 
     He points.

     ARCHIE AT THE TABLE - FROM MALCOLM'S POV
  
     The elderly man nods. He is big, he is very black. The same color as 
     Malcolm's father. 

     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
     He raises his glass, toasts Archie and downs it. Then leaning into the 
     bar, asks:
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Who is he, man?
 
                    BARTENDER
          That's West Indian Archie.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Whut's he do?
 
     The bartender would not normally answer this, but Malcolm is the man of 
     the moment, so the bartender speaks:
 
                    BARTENDER
          This and that.
 
     Malcolm nods, then looks over again at Archie -- in appreciation. 
     Archie wiggles a finger for him to come over.
 
59A      AT ARCHIE'S TABLE
 
     Malcolm is standing.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look 
          brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          He had it coming.
 
     Malcolm sits. There are no introductions. He just nods at SAMMY and 
     CADILLAC.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          What they call you?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Red, and I ain't no punk.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down 
          in this town, you better stand up or make 
          tracks.
 
                    SAMMY
          Man live by his rep.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          That's a fact. What you do, boy?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I'm working trains. Selling.
 
                    ARCHIE
          Bet you like that shit.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Keeps me out of the army.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you 
          out.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I 
          got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a 
          good man to know.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          Heard where?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Where I come from. Boston.
 
     Sammy and Cadillac are watching a little skeptically. Archie is 
     flattered.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Man's rep travels.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          How 'bout that?
 
     Then seeing Sammy and Cadillac's dubious visages, Archie adds:
 
                    ARCHIE (contd) 
          You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          My papa taught me one thing: don't never 
          bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.

     Archie laughs. Even Sammy smiles. Cadillac still holds his judgment.
  
                    ARCHIE 
          Is your papa West Indian?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          I like you, country.
 
                    SAMMY
          Only where'd you get them goddam vines.
 
                    CADILLAC 
          And them shoes. Oh, my.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          Yeah, got to do something about you.
 
                    SAMMY
          You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
 
     Sammy covers his eyes. Malcolm plays off the insults.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Where can I get a hold of you?
 
                    ARCHIE 
          YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Lemme write it down for you.
 
     Malcolm reaches for a pencil.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          Don't never write nothing down. File it up 
          here, like I do.
               (touching his head) 
          'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't 
          got no proof. Ya dig?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Yes, sir.
 
     Archie looks at him sharply.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          Boy, look me in the face.
 
     Malcolm does so.

                    ARCHIE (contd) 
          Did you just now con me?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Yes, sir.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          Why?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to 
          know you there, daddy.

     Archie and Sammy laugh at his directness. Cadillac smiles. Archie 
     pushes back his chair, about to get up. 

                    ARCHIE 
          I got me a little run to make.
 
     Malcolm has suddenly been excluded and he wants desperately back in.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Can I run with you, Mr. Archie?
 
     Archie eyes him, weighing him seriously.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          I like your heart and I like your style. You 
          might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git 
          back to that train job.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I done told the man what he could do with his 
          train.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          When?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Just now.
 
     The three established hustlers smile at the newcomer in their midst.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          Come on, baby. We going shopping...

63      INT. ARCHIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
 
     Malcolm is looking at himself in a mirror in Archie's room. He has on 
     the full outfit now, together with a new white on white shirt and a 
     Sulka tie. Looks great.
 
                    ARCHIE
          Just the middle button, baby. Just the middle 
          one.
 
     Malcolm buttons the jacket and turns around, demonstrating for Archie's 
     inspection.
 
                    ARCHIE (contd) 
          You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as 
          the Board of Health. But you missing something.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What?
 
                    ARCHIE 
          Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down.
 
     Malcolm doesn't understand, but he senses something -- and becomes 
     excited. Archie has walked over to him.
 
                    ARCHIE (contd) 
          Go ahead. Do me.
 
     Malcolm frisks him carefully: pats his sides, his pockets, under his 
     arms, his legs. Archie is clean to the touch.
 
                    ARCHIE (contd) 
               (triumphantly) 
          And I'm still carrying.

     He smacks the small of his back. Then, reaching under his coat, he 
     takes a revolver out from the middle of his back. And hands it to 
     Malcolm.
 
     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
     Holding the deadly instrument, fascinated by it, hefting it, feeling 
     its power.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          It's yours, baby. Put it on.

     Malcolm slips it carefully into the small of his back, behind his 
     trouser belt. His first gun: the feeling shines in his eyes, Bogart has 
     become a black man.

                    ARCHIE (contd) 
          How's it feel?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Solid, daddy.
 
                    ARCHIE
          Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to

      There is music playing. Wordlessly, Archie sprinkles a few grains of 
     fine crystal onto a round shaving mirror. He slides it across a table 
     to Malcolm and hands him a short straw. Sophia sits next to Malcolm; 
     she and Archie are already high. Malcolm leans over the mirror, placing 
     the straw in his nostril.
 
     TIGHT CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM'S FACE
 
     In the mirror (something satanic about him) -- as he sniffs the cocaine 
     well into his nose.

     A beat as he leans back waiting for the drug to take hold, Malcolm 
     looks into dressing mirror.

     Before Sophia can answer he grabs her pocketbook, dumping all the 
     contents on the floor but the dough.

          Baby, what's today?
 
     Sophia is not sure of this, or anything else.
 
                    SOPHIA 
          August 2nd. I think. Yeah.
 
     She laughs at her achievement.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Daddy, put me down for a combination. Combinate 
          me, daddy: 8, 2, 1. You got me? 8, 1, 2; 1, 8, 
          2...
 
     With each number he throws a bill at Archie.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd)
           1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?

                    ARCHIE 
               (angrily taking the money) 
          I'll take your goddam bet.
 
     Malcolm slides his tongue down Sophia's throat.

75     EXT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT 

     A miserable night, raining and cold. Malcolm turns into the bar.
 
76      INT. THE BAR - NIGHT
 
     Shaking off the rain as Malcolm walks through. He is now a familiar 
     figure to the bar's DENIZENS. He is met with ad lib cries: "Hey, 
     Little," "Have a taste," from the men; and from the women: "Come here, 
     sugar," "Where you been?"
 
     Malcolm acknowledges the greetings, strolls down in the bar. It's 
     immediately clear that a subtle change has come over him. He is no 
     longer the neophyte but a well-groomed, smooth, fully polished hustler.

     ANGLE - BOOTH 

     Malcolm sits into the booth and motions for the waitress.
 
     ANGLE - HONEY
 
     A fine copper tan waitress comes to him.
 
                    HONEY
          I thought you said we were going to the movies 
          last night.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I say a lot of things.
 
                    HONEY
          And like a fool I believe it.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and 
          a pack of Lucky's.
 
     Honey stares at him.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          I said now.
 
     She leaves. He leans his head back against the booth --
 
                    A FEMALE VOICE 
          Daniel come in yet, Honey?
 
     Malcolm turns his head sharply at the sound of the voice. It's 
     familiar, a sound from the seemingly distant past. He looks toward the 
     bar and sees the women who asked the question.
 
     LAURA - MALCOLM'S POV
 
     It's Laura, but not the Laura we last saw. She is still young, still 
     vulnerable, but she is bolder, more self-assured, more vividly dressed.
     She is unaware of Malcolm.
 
                    HONEY
          Ain't that him now?
 
     ANGLE FAVORING DANIEL. He is a young, cocky, nervous, gingerbread 
     colored boy who comes over to her quickly. He goes to the corner of the 
     bar and quickly grabs Laura's neck and kisses her hungrily.
 
                    DANIEL 
          Hey, gorgeous, how you been? Waiting long? 
          Lemme see you. Wow!

     It's obvious he's a junkie. And in need of a fix. QUICK!
 
     SHOT - MALCOLM
 
     Honey places his drink and cigarettes before him. He's watching, taking 
     it all in immediately. Laura is clearly crazy about Daniel. 

     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
     He looks, then belts down his drink. 

     CLOSER - LAURA AND DANIEL 

     Daniel motions to her pocketbook and she takes out a five-dollar bill. 
     He grabs it, and bolts for the door. 

     WITH MALCOLM AND HONEY 

     She has been watching Malcolm.
 
                    HONEY
          You know that gal?

                    MALCOLM 
          Mind your own goddamn business ... She comes in 
          a lot?
 
                    HONEY
          'Bout every other night, Red.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          With him?

     Honey nods.
  
                     MALCOLM (contd) 
          She know?
 
                    HONEY
          If she got eyes, she do.
 
     ANGLE - LAURA

     Walking toward the door, looking for Daniel. She leaves the bar. 

     CLOSE - MALCOLM AND HONEY
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Is she hooking?
 
                    HONEY
          Not yet. But the way things going, that boy 
          gonna turn her out any day.
 
     Malcolm smacks the table in frustration.
 
                    HONEY (contd) 
          You stuck on her?
 
     CLOSE - GLASS

     Malcolm's glass on the table is trembling. 

                    MALCOLM 
          Shut up, bitch.

     He raises his arm to hit her and it is held back before it can find its
     mark.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          Don't do that.
 
     Archie is standing above him. Malcolm nods, and Archie lets his arm go; 
     standing next to him is Sophia.
 
                    ARCHIE (contd) 
          Honey, he didn't mean it.

     Archie wiggles his fingers and Honey goes, but not before throwing 
     daggers at Malcolm and Sophia. Archie sits down, takes out a cigar. For 
     a good beat there is a coolness between them. Then Malcolm reaches over 
     and lights Archie's cigar. Sophia stares at her man, he then motions 
     for her to sit down beside him.
 
                    ARCHIE (contd) 
          Thanks. You got it. Who's beating on you, Red? 
          You looking a little up tight.

     The father-son thing is back, but Malcolm will never again be the 
     student.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Daddy, where's my money?
 
                    ARCHIE 
          What you talking?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          You owe me six big ones.
 
     Archie looks at him, non-comprehending.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
 
                    ARCHIE 
          You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at
          you. I said to combinate me.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          You never had it.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          The bitch was there.
 
     Archie doesn't even look at Sophia.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          Shit, what else she gonna say?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You 
          done slipped.
 
     Archie is controlling himself. Everyone in Small's is all ears, a
      falling out between Malcolm and Archie -- their reps are at stake.
 
     ANGLE. Archie looks at Sammy. Sammy is neutral. Archie digs in his 
     pockets, comes up with a roll. He peels off six $100 bills and throws 
     them on the table in front of himself, as he gets up.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
 
                    ARCHIE
          I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
 
                    SAMMY
          Be right there.
 
     Archie goes.

                    SAMMY (contd) 
          Twenty-two years he didn't never forget no 
          number.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Got to be a first time, daddy-o.
 
                    SAMMY
          He gonna, check the collector he turn into. His 
          rep is on the line, boy, and so's yours. If you 
          lying, one of you is dead.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Ain't gonna be this mother.
 
     Sammy goes.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Come on, sweetlips, I got us some g-i-r-l, 
          girl. Let's you and me fly.

          You know it.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I'll give you back the 600.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          I don't want your money.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I'm wearing, Archie.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          There's two guns on you.
 
     His eyes gesture. Malcolm looks: 

     MALCOLM'S P0V 

     Sammy at the nearby bar: his hand in his coat pocket.

     CLOSE - ARCHIE
 
     His hand is also in his pocket.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          And every cat's watching, ain't they? It's a 
          toe-down.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          That's what it is. Walk on out.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Let Billie finish.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          Now.
 
     Archie backs away from the table, his gun on Malcolm. 

     ANGLE. As Sammy moves a step toward Malcolm, Malcolm rises in his seat.
 
                    SOPHIA 
          You had the number.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the 
          faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
 
     CLOSE - BILLIE
 
     She knows what's going on.
 
     ANGLE - Sammy and Archie are walking behind Malcolm, when he pushes a 
     waitress into their path with drinks flying everywhere, Malcolm darts 
     away.

87     INT. ENTRANCE TO THE TOILET 

      He races into the men's room.

     ANGLE. Archie and Sammy run after him.
 
88     INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT 

     There is an open window. Archie is leaning out, looking both ways. 

89     EXT. OUTSIDE THE MEN'S ROOM WINDOW - NIGHT FROM ARCHIE'S POV
 
     A tiny alleyway. No one is visible.

                    ARCHIE 
          The dirty yellow rat bastard.
 
90     INT. MEN~S ROOM - NIGHT
 
                    SAMMY

          That boy loves you, man.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          What you say?
 
                    SAMMY
          He gave it to you, Archie. He did.
 
91       EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT
 
     Malcolm comes running out of an alleyway and onto the street. He stops 
     to catch his breath, to regain his composure. He is shook up, 
     frustrated, but mostly saddened. He then runs down the block and into a 
     CLOSEUP.
 
91A      INT. LITTLE HOUSE - LANSING MICHIGAN - NIGHT (REMEMBERED TIME) - 
     FINAL FLASHBACK

     CLOSE - EARL

     Earl is sitting up in bed, he wakes his sleeping wife Louise, next to

     her.

     Outside the house are 5 members of THE BLACK LEGION. They are dressed 
     in the style of the KKK, but in black sheets rather than white. WE SEE 
     gasoline cans being passed around.
 
                    EARL 
          Somebody out there. Wake the children. 

     Earl starts to put on his overalls and reaches for his gun which sits 
     on a nearby chair when an explosion of flames greets the house.
 
                    EARL (contd) 
          Everybody out. OUT! OUT! Get the kids. 

     ANGLE - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM

     Earl takes his pistol out from behind his back and fires above their 
     heads.
 
                    EARL (contd) 
          Take these here bullets for dem sheets.

     Young Malcolm stares at his father while the house still burns behind 
     him, no doubt drawing on the great courage displayed by his father.

          They won't be here no time soon. I'm a MAN! 

91D     EXT. STREET - LANSING - NIGHT (REMEMBERED TIME)

          My father's skull, on one side was crushed in, 
          and then laid across some tracks, for a 
          streetcar to run him over. His body was cut 
          almost in half. My father, Earl Little lived 
          two and a half hours in that condition. Negroes 
          were stronger than they are now.
 
92     INT. A CAR - NIGHT
 
     Shorty is driving with Sophia in the front seat. Malcolm is in the 
     back. They are in the country -- outside New York.
 
                    SHORTY 
          Man, I'm glad we got you out of there. With 
          West Indian Archie on your ass, your name on 
          the wire -- Boston the best goddam place in the 
          world for you -- things are too hot and it's 
          not even summer.
 
     Malcolm has withdrawn within himself. He takes out a packet of cocaine 
     and sniffs it.
 
                    SOPHIA 
          We'll take it easy. I got a place fixed up on 
          Harvard Square. How's that sound?
 
                    SHORTY 
          Yeah. Cool it and lay dead for a while, Homeboy. 
          And don't worry none.
 
     The drug takes hold. Malcolm is out of it.
 
                    SHORTY (contd) 
          I'll stake you, baby. I got my band. I'm 
          blowing great sax. Hell, you ain't even heard 
          us--
 
     He and Sophia keep talking it up, trying to bolster Malcolm. 

     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
     Stoned, his nose running, Malcolm stares out of the window at the
     receding landscape. FREEZE FRAME.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X 
          Like every hustler I was trapped. Cats that 
          hung together trying to find a little security, 
          to find an answer -- found nothing. Cats that 
          might have probed space or cured cancer -- 
          (Hell, Archie might have been a mathematical 
          genius) -- all victims of whitey's social order.
 
     Music of a dance combo heard in BG.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
          Three things I was always scared of: a job, a 
          bust and jail. I realized then I wasn't afraid 
          of anything. I didn't care.

                    SHORTY 
          I ain't doing bad.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you 
          gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, 
          a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey 
          ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got?
 
     Peg smiles, afraid of Malcolm.
 
                    SHORTY 
          Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this. 

     Shorty eyes him with amazement. The degree of Malcolm's depravity 
     surprises even him.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Surprise you, baby? Well, that's the way it is. 
          What kind of scratch you got on you? Turn out. 
          Let me have it. All of you--
 
     Glances exchanged among Shorty, Sophia and Peg. Shorty reaches into his 
     pocket.
 
95      INT. HARVARD SQUARE APARTMENT - NIGHT 

     Malcolm with Sophia, Shorty and Peg around him.

                    MALCOLM 
          We gone rob this town blind. Anybody want out 
          say so. 

     Nobody answers; they'll go with Malcolm.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Okay. I got the stake and I got a fence. I need 
          a driver.
 
                    PEG 
          How about Rudy?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Who's Rudy? 

                    SHORTY 
          Yeah, Rudy.

                                        JUMP CUT:

95A      SAME LOCATION - LATER
 
     RUDY is with them. He is a good-looking, very-light skinned black, 
     tough as they come.
 
                    RUDY
          I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of 
          no one.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What can you do?
 
     They are in the process of appraising each other, seeing which one has 
     the bigger penis.
 
                    RUDY
          You name it, feller.
 
                    SHORTY 
          Rudy does catering. Rich joints on Beacon Hill.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          That ain't bad.
 
                    SHORTY 
          Tell him about Baldy.
  
                    RUDY
          Yeah. This rich ofay, like he's 60. I give him 
          a bath on Friday.
 
     Peg and Sophia are listening, a little horrified.
 
                    RUDY (contd) 
          Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on 
          him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          So what about him?
 
                    RUDY
          So? The man got silver, china, rugs--
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Might be all right.
 
                    RUDY
          Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my 
          own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you 
          in charge?
 
     Malcolm smiles easily.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          You want to be the head man?
 
                    RUDY
          That's right.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Head nigger in charge?
 
                    RUDY
          I'm the man.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
 
     He takes out his gun, a .38 revolver. He dumps the shells on the table, 
     then reinserts one shell and twirls the barrel.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          I'll flip first.
 
     He puts the revolver to his own head.
 
                    PEG 
          Don't.
 
     Malcolm squeezes the trigger. It clicks. Now he twirls the barrel again 
     and hands the gun to Rudy.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Your flip, baby.

     Rudy is staring at him; so are they all. Malcolm puts the gun to his 
     temple again.
 
                    SOPHIA 
          Red, for God's sake-- 

     He pulls the trigger a second time. Click. Now he twirls it again.
 
                    SHORTY 
          Christ, Red, no--

                    PEG 
          I can't stand it. 

     Malcolm puts the gun to Rudy's head.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Your turn, Rudy. You want me to flip for you?
 
                    RUDY
          Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you 
          got it! You're the boss. 

     A beat.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Don't never try to cross someone who ain't 
          afraid to die.
 
                    SHORTY 
          You the man!
 
     Nodding accord from Rudy and Shorty. Sophia can hardly stand.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          All right. We'll start with Old Talcum Powder. 
          You draw the house, where everything is. You 
          and Peg go out and buy them tools like I told 
          you. We hit tonight on account of in the 
          daytime some of us got that high visibility. 
          Ya dig?
 
     Rudy is at a table drawing a diagram; the girls have left. Shorty and 
     Malcolm alone at a window.
 
                    SHORTY 
          What did you do, Homey, palm it?
 
                    MALCOLM
          Yeah.

     He breaks open the gun -- the bullet is in the next slot to be fired. 

                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Palmed it right in the goddam chamber. 

                    SHORTY 
          Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts. 

     Malcolm starts laughing: a silent, hysterical laugh. 

96     EXT/INT. A BEACON HILL HOUSE - NIGHT
 
     The robbery, IN QUICK CUTS: 

     --A door lock is picked by Sophia.

96A     --Pencil flashlight passes an upstairs window.

96E     --Malcolm takes off his shoes.
 
96F     --The sleeping OLD MAN, OLD TALCUM POWDER, as Malcolm takes a watch, a 
     wallet from within inches of his pillow. Then, more boldly, picks up 
     the man's hand and removes a ring from one of his fingers. Shorty 
     watching with bated breath, he's about to have a heart attack.

101     INT. A COURTROOM - DAY 

     The prisoners face the bench: Peg, Sophia, Shorty, Rudy and Malcolm.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X 
          The average first offender gets two years for 
          burglary. We were all first offenders. That's 
          what Sophia and Peg drew--
 
                    JUDGE
          Two years in the Women's Reformatory at 
          Framingham.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X 
          But our crime wasn't burglary. It was balling 
          white girls. They gave us the book.
 
                    JUDGE
          Burglary, count one -- 8 to 10 years; count two, 
          8 to 10 years; count three, 8 to 10 years...
 
     He continues giving them 8 to 10 years, behind Malcolm's comment: 

                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X 
          Fourteen counts of 8 to 10 years.
 
                    JUDGE
          The sentences to run concurrently.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X 
          Shorty thought he hit us with 114 years till I 
          explained what concurrently meant. It meant a 
          minimum sentence of 10 years hard labor at the 
          Charlestown State Prison. The date was February 
          1946. I wasn't quite 21. I had not yet begun to 
          shave.
 
     CAMERA HAS GONE IN for a TIGHT CLOSE SHOT of Malcolm's face: a hardened 
     hustler, pimp, dope peddler and now jailbird at the ripe old age of 20.  
     FREEZE FRAME.

                                        CUT TO BLACK.
 
FADE IN:
 
102     INT. THE CELL CORRIDOR - DAY
 
     It is the afternoon lockup: about 3:30 P.M. The line of PRISONERS 
     stands in front of their cells, as two guards, WILKINS and BARNES, one 
     white, one black, slowly walk past the P.M. check. 

     The procedure is routine, done without emotion, as it is done three 
     times a day: the black guard calls out the prisoner's name, the 
     prisoner answers with his number, then steps into his cell. Whereupon 
     the white guard slams the door shut and locks it.
 
                    GUARD WILKINS 
          Jackson.
 
                    PRISONER 
          A 231549.
 
     Door is slammed and gate locked. 

     CLOSE - MALCOLM 

     Each time a gate is locked his tension increases. His face is a mask 
     hiding his fury, violence and the hunger of an advanced junkie who has 
     not had a fix in over a week.
 
                    GUARD WILKINS 
          Crichlow.
 
                    SECOND PRISONER
          A 5991301.
 
     Same procedure.
 
     ANGLE. SHOOTING PAST MALCOLM, FAVORING TWO OTHER PRISONERS. The guards 
     are approaching Malcolm's cell. Past Malcolm are two experienced 
     PRISONERS who have been watching Malcolm during the scene. They whisper 
     surreptitiously without moving their bodies, and barely moving their 
     lips. One of the prisoners is PETE, a huge barrel of a man, a lifer --
     beaten by the system and a lifetime of incarceration. The other is 
     BEMBRY, a man of no great physicality, but who possesses immediately 
     the gift of leadership. It is clear that Pete and others look up to him 
     with great respect.
 
                    PETE
          Looka Satan.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          I see him.
 
     Bembry's language is very unhip. He speaks carefully. He respects words 
     and he respects himself, something which sets him apart from all the 
     other prisoners.
 
                    PETE
          He bout to bust.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          No, he's not gonna bust. But he's not gonna fix 
          his face to please them, neither.

     ANGLE. The check-in has reached the man next to Malcolm.

                    GUARD WILKINS 
          Harrington.
 
                    THIRD PRISONER 
          B 775717.
 
                    GUARD BARNES 
          Yeah. Lucky Seven.
 
     Door slammed and locked. 

     CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM 

     The guards are now in front of him.
 
                    GUARD WILKINS 
          Little.
 
     Malcolm doesn't move.
 
                    GUARD BARNES 
          State your number.
 
     Malcolm doesn't answer, doesn't blink.
 
                    GUARD WILKINS 
          Little.
 
     ANGLE. Bembry in the FG of the scene. 

                    BEMBRY 
          He's a new fish, Mr. Barnes. Give him a break.
 
     It's a bold step by Bembry and the prisoners look over at him with
     admiration. Barnes accepts the irregularity and calls over to Bembry.

                    GUARD BARNES 
          0kay, I'll give him a break. Now state your 
          number, Little.
 
     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I forgot it.
 
      CLOSE SHOT - BEMBRY

     Shaking his head in anguish. He knows what's coming. 

     ANGLE. Barnes makes a small gesture and Wilkins seizes Malcolm, 
     grabbing his head and uniform at the same time. Stenciled on the chest 
     of his faded dungarees is Malcolm's number. The guard bends Malcolm's 
     head to the number, shoving the material in Malcolm's face.
 
                    GUARD WILKINS 
          Can you read, boy? Thass your number.
 
                    GUARD BARNES 
          Now say it.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I'm Malcolm Little, not no goddam number.
 
                    GUARD WILKINS 
          Oh, yes you is, baby; thass all you is.
 
     And slams Malcolm hard. He slumps to the floor.
 
                    GUARD BARNES 
          Two days in the hole. Take him.
 
     Wilkins drags Malcolm off as Barnes resumes the roll call.
 
                    GUARD BARNES (contd) 
          Burnham.
 
                    FOURTH PRISONER
          A 551613, sir.
 
                                        JUMP CUT:
 
103      INT. A SOLITARY CELL - DAY
 
     Only the faintest light comes into the hideous room, which consists of 
     a mattress and a slop bucket. If Malcolm were to stretch out his arms, 
     he could touch both walls. He lies half on the stone floor, half on the
      mattress.
 
     A clang as the heavy door is opened.
 
                    GUARD CONE
          Time's up. Get on your feet.
 
     Malcolm stands.
 
                    GUARD CONE (contd) 
          Little, state your number.
 
     A beat as Malcolm stares at the man, refusing to answer.
 
                    GUARD CONE (contd) 
          You just drew two more days.
 
     And slams the door shut. 

104     INT. SOLITARY - NIGHT
 
     It is almost pitch black. We can almost smell the stench of the room. 
     Malcolm sits stony-faced, his back against a wall. 

                    TRUSTEE'S VOICE
          Water.
 
     The long spigot of a watering can is pushed through an opening in 
     the cell door. Malcolm, animal-like, leaps at it and bends the spout, 
     wrenching it off in his fury.
 
105     OMIT

106     INT. SOLITARY CELL - DAY 

     TWO-SHOT - A WHITE CHAPLAIN AND MALCOLM 

                    CHAPLAIN GILL 
          Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, 
          son?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin 
          Mary, both, and shove 'em.
 
     Door slam.
 
107     INT. SOLITARY - NIGHT 

     Malcolm is alone at the bars: the hope of freedom filling his mind.
 
     Malcolm pulls at the bars, tries to shake them in impotent fury. He 
     pounds the walls. Empty, sick, defeated, his nails scratching the 
     walls, he slides to the floor of the cell.

     It is the low point of his life: nowhere to turn, nothing to hope for.
 
108  INT. SOLITARY - LATER
 
     Guard Cone is shaking him into consciousness.
 
                    GUARD CONE
          All right, Little. Get up.
 
     Malcolm just about makes it. The guard is in half-focus. 

                    GUARD CONE (contd) 
          State your number.
 
     He is beaten.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          A 859912.
 
     A shower is heard.

109      INT. SHOWER ROOM - DAY
 
     Malcolm stands with bowed head as the hot water cascades over his 
     broken body. He lets it run and run, but it cannot really touch his 
     problems. On a nearby bench are his clothes, his towel and the makings 
     for a conk: lye, Vaseline, comb, etc.
 
     He turns for a moment as he sees he is being watched by someone. It's 
     Bembry standing nearby. Malcolm turns away, trying to find solace in 
     the water. He wants no part of the world or anyone, just to be left 
     alone.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          I know how you feel. Like you want to lay down 
          and die.
 
     Malcolm shows no flicker of interest or understanding.
 
                    BEMBRY (contd) 
          I brought you something.
 
     He puts down a small matchbox on the bench next to Malcolm's things. 
     Malcolm eyes him like a snake -- but the punishment has reduced him to 
     deep insecurity and his belligerence is more cautious than angry.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Who the hell are you?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Man, what do you want?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          You need something. It's not a reefer, but 
          it'll help some.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
 
     But he steps out of the shower, fills a tin cup with water and empties 
     the contents of the matchbox into it. And drinks it down quickly.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Sit down or it might knock you down.
 
     Malcolm sits, toweling himself as the spice hits him. For the first, he 
     smiles; this is the first relief he has tasted in prison. He at Bembry 
     wonderingly, unable to figure him out.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your 
          hype?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          I can show you how to get out of prison. And 
          it's no hype.
 
                    MALCOLM
          Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. 
          You got some more?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What did you give it to me for then?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear 
          me without it.
 
     This is a new breed of cat; Malcolm has never met anyone like him. He 
     eyes him closely, as he slips into his clothes.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What in the hell are you talking about?
 
     He begins to conk his hair, but is paying attention to what Bembry is 
     saying.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          I think you got more sense than any cat in this 
          prison. How come you are such a fool?
 
     Malcolm looks over, piqued.
 
                    BEMBRY (contd) 
          Nobody can bust out like Bogart does it, in the
           movies. Because even if you get out, you are 
          still in prison.
 
     Malcolm is putting the conk into his hair now.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          You ain't lying.

                    BEMBRY 
          When you go busting your fists against a stone 
          wall, you're not using your brains. Cause 
          that's what the white man wants you to do. Look 
          at you.
 
     These last words are spoken sharply with disgust. Malcolm turns his 
     hands massaging the conk into his hair.
 
                    BEMBRY (contd) 
          Putting all that poison in your hair.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Man, you been locked up too long, everybody 
          conks. All the cats.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Why? Why does everybody conk?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Cause I don't want to walk around with my head 
          all nappy, looking like--
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! 
          Why don't you want to look like what you are? 
          What makes you ashamed of being black?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I ain't said I'm ashamed.
 
     He turns the water on to wash out the conk -- which has begun to burn. 
     Bembry restrains him, holding his arm.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Leggo. I got to wash it out.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
 
     But it is burning now.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Man, you better get off me.
 
     He wrenches away from Bembry and puts his head in the water.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all 
          that poison into your hair, into your body -- 
          trying to be white.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Man, I don't want to hear all that.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          I thought you was smart. But you just another 
          one of them cats strutting down the avenue in 
          your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like 
          a monkey. And the white man sees you and he 
          laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't 
          white.
 
     Malcolm is drying his hair, finishing his conk. But some of what Bembry 
     has said disturbs him.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Who are you?
 
     Malcolm is completely humiliated. Bembry sees this and stops the 
     barrage.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          The question is, who are you? You are in the 
          darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah 
          Muhammad can bring you into the light.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Elijah who?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out 
          of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want 
          is another fix. I thought you were smart.
 
     And he is gone. Malcolm stands looking after him, a long thoughtful 
     moment. He is pulling the comb through his hair.
 
110      INT. PRISON LICENSE SHOP - DAY
 
     PRISONERS are working on a beltline that stamps out and finishes 
     license plates. Bembry is on the stamping machines, working as he talks 
     to the other prisoners. Malcolm is painting the plates, a little 
     removed from Bembry, but listening with interest. Barnes, with rifle, 
     idles by a window.
 
     A whistle sounds, ending the work shift. The inmates quickly file out 
     into the yard. Bembry stays. Malcolm is half decided.
 
                    GUARD BARNES 
          You taking the yard?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          I'm staying.
 
     Barnes gestures to Malcolm.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Me too.

     He goes.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave 
          you your last fix.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you 
          scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          You the only cat don't come on with that 
          "Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss 
          none.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't 
          got the words to say what's on his mind.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Don't con me. Don't try...

                    MALCOLM 
          Okay, okay.

                    BEMBRY 
          Don't con me. 
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What do you do with your time?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          I read. I study. Because the first thing a 
          black man has to do is respect himself. Respect 
          his body and his mind. Quit taking the white 
          man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, 
          his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his 
          pork.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          That's what Mama used to say.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy 
          beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
 
     Malcolm has been pondering all this and now grows animated as he thinks 
     he has come to the essence of a hustle.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if 
          you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? 
          I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm 
          talking the words of Elijah, the black man's 
          God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What? Everybody knows God is White.
 
                    BEMBRY (contd) 
          But everything the white man taught you, you 
          learned. He told you you were a black heathen 
          and you believed him. He told you how he took 
          you out of darkness and brought you to the 
          light. And you believed him. He taught you to 
          worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin
          -- and you believed him. He told you black was 
          a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look 
          up the word black in the dictionary?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What for?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Did you ever study anything wasn't part of 
          some con?
 
                    MALCOLM
          What the hell for, man?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting 
          for you.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Okay, okay. Show me, man.
 
110A      CLOSE SHOT - A DICTIONARY
 
     WE CAN READ the fine print of the definition:
 
                    DICTIONARY
          Black, (blak), adj. Destitute of light, devoid 
          of color, enveloped in darkness. Hence, utterly 
          dismal or gloomy, as "the future looked black."
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          You understand them words?
 
                    BEMBRY'S VOICE 
          Read it.
 
     PULLBACK TO SHOW Bembry and Malcolm in a small PRISON LIBRARY. No one 
     else is in the book-lined room.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I can't make out that shit.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, 
          forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or 
          outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. 
          Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
 
                    DICTIONARY
          See also blackmail, blackball, blackguard.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Hey, they's some shit, all right.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Now look up "white."
 
     Bembry turns the pages of the dictionary to "w."
 
                    BEMBRY (contd) 
          Read it.
 
     CLOSE SHOT - DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF "WHITE"
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          White (whit), adj. Of the color of pure snow; 
          reflecting all the rays of the spectrum. The 
          opposite of black, hence free from spot or 
          blemish; innocent, pure, without evil intent, 
          harmless. Honest, square-dealing, honorable.
 
     Malcolm stumbles through the definition as well as he can. Bembry takes 
     over the reading, giving it ironic emphasis.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. 
          Ain't all these white man's books?
 
     SHOT - THE SHELVES OF BOOKS
 
                    BEMBRY 
          They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Then what you telling me to study in them for?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          You got to learn everything the white man says 
          and use it against him. The truth is laying 
          there if you smart and read behind their words. 
          It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking 
          at?
 
     Bembry smiles at Malcolm. He is a remarkable man who always takes 
     careful measure of his listener. He never talks down to his audience; 
     he talks to them. (A manner Malcolm later will adopt.) Bembry can talk
      funky or salty or, as we will see, in the cadence and eloquence of the 
     Bible. Right now he goes into street talk.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          I'll pull your coat, daddy. Cause lots of these 
          can't nobody read, be he black or white or a 
          Ph.D. with their suspenders dragging the ground 
          with degrees.
 
     Malcolm laughs. He likes and admires the man. Then caught by a passage 
     he does not understand:
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig 
          half the words.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Where am I gonna start?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Start at the beginning. Page one, the first 
          one. Here--
 
     CLOSE SHOT
 
     As Bembry's hand opens the book to page one.

112     OMIT

113     INT. MALCOLM'S CELL - NIGHT 

     He is reading on his bunk as Barnes walks by. The lights in the cell go 
     out. Malcolm looks up, annoyed at being interrupted. He shifts his 
     position to the floor of the cell so that he can catch the dim light 
     coming from the corridor and goes on with his reading. 

     CLOSE SHOT - THE BOOK 

     Malcolm is studying the dictionary, the last of the "a's": the words
     azimuth, Azores, Aztec, azure, etc. He reads a word, then holds his 
     hand over the printed definition to test himself, half-mouthing its 
     meaning. Malcolm is also copying the dictionary in a school book word 
     for word.
 
114      INT. LIBRARY - DAY
 
     There are several books on the desk before Malcolm. WE SEE their 
     titles: W.E.B. DuBois's _The Soul of Black Folks_, Carter G. Woodson's 
     _Journal of Negro History_, Durant's _Story of Philosophy_, H.G. 
     Wells's _Outline of History_, Spinoza, Thoreau, etc.
 
                    GUARD BARNES'S VOICE
          Closing. Knock it off.
 
     Malcolm is surprised the time has gone so fast. He gathers up his books 
     with care. He cherishes them, putting them back on the shelf carefully.
 
                    GUARD BARNES
          You studying to be the first colored 
          President of the States?
 
115     INT. LICENSE SHOP - DAY
 
     The machines are idle; no one is in the room but Malcolm. He starts 
     to reach inside his jacket when Barnes sticks his head in.
 
                    GUARD BARNES 
          You taking the yard or not?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I'm staying.
 
                    GUARD BARNES 
          Then give me a butt.
 
     Malcolm takes out a half-filled pack of cigarettes, about to offer one, 
     then pauses. Malcolm hands him the pack of cigarettes.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Take 'em. I don't smoke no more.
 
     He takes the pack happily and goes. Malcolm reaches into his jacket 
     again, takes out a book. WE SEE its title: Mahatma Gandhi's _My 
     Struggle_. He sits next to the license press to read.
 
116     EXT. THE PRISON YARD - DAY 

     A baseball game is in progress. A BLACK TEAM is playing a WHITE ONE. 
     Most of the CONVICTS are watching the game; partisanship at every 
     pitch. A base hit gets a big reaction. 

     ANGLE - MALCOLM AND BEMBRY 

     They are out along the right field wall. They walk throughout the scene.

     ANGLE - The ball is hit over the fence for a home run. There is a big 
     cheer from the black prisoners. Pete, the batter, trots proudly around 
     the bases.
  
                    MALCOLM 
          Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay 
          in there with the wood.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Lemme tell you about history: black history. 
          You listening?
 
     TWO-SHOT - Malcolm still watching the game.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          The first men on earth were black. They ruled 
          and there was not one white face anywhere. But 
          they teach us that we lived in caves and swung 
          from trees. Black men were never like that.
 
     Malcolm is listening to Bembry's intent statement.
 
                    BEMBRY (contd) 
          We were a race of kings when the white men went 
          around on all fours.
 
     There is a crack of the bat and Malcolm turns to watch another base 
     hit, by a black convict, stir the crowd.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          This a helluva game. Somethin's going on.
 
     He sees a black convict, CHUCK, nearby and calls over:
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Hey, whatsa score?
 
                    CHUCK
          10 to 1; we murdering them, Din't you hear?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What?
 
                    CHUCK
          The Brooklyn Dodgers brought up Jackie Robinson 
          and we pounding the hell out of them, 
          celebrating.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          How bout that?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's 
          supposed to make us forget 400 years.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          A black man playing big league ball is 
          something.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          I told you to go behind the words and dig out 
          the truth. They let us sing and dance and 
          smile -- and now they let one black man in the 
          majors. That don't cancel out the greatest 
          crime in history. When that blue-eyed devil 
          locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- 
          broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off 
          from our language, our religion, our history.

     SHOTS OF THE FACES OF THE BLACK BALL PLAYERS AND THE CONVICTS
 
     In the stands, cheering and joyous.
 
                    BEMBRY (contd) 
          Do they know who they are? Do you know where 
          you came from? We are the Original People.
 
     Malcolm is listening to him now.
 
                    BEMBRY (contd) 
          What's your name, boy?
 
     Malcolm is startled; answers like a boy.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Little.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          No. That's the name of the slave-master who 
          owned your family. You don't even know who you 
          are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. 
          Who are you?
 
     CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM 

     Wrapped in thought. 

     ANGLE ON MALCOLM
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I'm not Malcolm Little and I'm not Satan.
  
                    BEMBRY 
          Who are you?
 
     CLOSE - MALCOLM 

     Malcolm cannot answer because he truly does not know.
 
     A ball is hit. Malcolm watches its flight but his face is fixed 
     somewhere between understanding and anger: it is the face of the future 
     leader.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          I told you we are a nation, the lost Tribe of 
          Shabazz in the wilderness of North America.
 
117      INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE PRISON - LATE AFTERNOON
 
     The rays of the sun come through bars that cut across Malcolm and 
     Bembry's face.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named 
          Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm--
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Then the devil is white.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the 
          devil. All white men are devils.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I sure met some.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white 
          man is a devil." He teaches us that the white 
          man is the devil. All white men.
 
     CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM
 
     Listening.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Have you ever known a good white man in all 
          your life? Think back, did you ever meet one 
          who wasn't evil?
 
     A prison whistle is heard.
 
119     OMIT

120     INT. A NICHE IN A PRISON WALL - P.M.

     Malcolm and Bembry standing close together. The feeling is of someone 
     taking communion: with Bembry the minister and Malcolm the communicant. 
     Their voices are little more than whispers.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          The body is a holy repository.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I will not touch the white man's poison: his 
          drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          A Muslim must be strikingly upright. 
          Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see 
          the power of the light.
 
     Malcolm lifts his head.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I will do it.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          But the key to Islam is submission. That is why 
          twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of 
          Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
 
     Bembry kneels in a praying position. Malcolm stands.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I can't.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, 
          implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing 
          on earth--
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          --the hardest and the greatest.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I can't.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, 
          implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing 
          on earth--
  
                    MALCOLM 
          I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          --the hardest and the greatest.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I don't know what to say to Allah.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
 
     Malcolm laugh-snorts:
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob 
          somebody's house.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Tell Him that.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I don't know how.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to 
          save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick 
          it.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I want to. God knows I want to.
 
121     INT. MALCOLM'S CELL-NIGHT

     Malcolm holds a letter in his hand. He reads it carefully. He has read 
     it several times before.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X
          I received a letter that day from the Honorable 
          Elijah Muhammad. The Messenger of Allah wrote 
          me, a nobody, a junkie, a pimp and a convict.
 
                    VOICE OF ELIJAH 
          I have come to give you something which can 
          never be taken from you: I bring you a sense of 
          your own worth, the worth of one human being. 
          The knowledge of self.
 
     The room becomes transformed. It is suddenly suffused with light. And 
     standing in the cell with Malcolm is ELIJAH MUHAMMAD. He has 
     materialized, but he can be seen through. He is MALCOLM'S 
     HALLUCINATION.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X 
          It was like a blinding light and I became aware 
          that he was in the room with me. He wore a dark 
          suit and on his face I saw a pain so old and 
          deep and black I could scarcely look at him. I 
          knew I was not dreaming. He was there.
 
                    ELIJAH 
          I tell you that the most dangerous creation of 
          any society in the world is the man with 
          nothing to lose. You do not need ten such men 
          to change the world. One will do. The Earth 
          belongs to us, the Black man and whatever is 
          around it, and on it and in it. Praises are 
          due to him forever for bringing to us again, 
          our self and our property, the UNIVERSE OF SUN, 
          MOON, AND STARS.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X 
          And suddenly as he came, he was gone.
 
     The hallucination disappears.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
          And then I could do it.
 
     Malcolm goes down on his knees. There are tears in his eyes as he 
     begins praying:
 
     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Allah Akbar: all praise to Him who is 
          all-seeing, all-understanding.
 
     He continues to pray.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X 
          We are told that Saul, on the road to Damascus, 
          heard the words of truth, he fell from his 
          horse. I do not liken myself to Paul, but I 
          understand. It happened to me.
 
122     INT. BEMBRY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
     A poorly furnished, small, but immaculate room. There are two couches, 
     a table set for eating, and, on the walls, a portrait of Elijah and a 
     Muslim banner. It is dinner time in a Muslim home.
 
     SIDNEY, aged 20, a perfect specimen of the Fruit of Islam, stands 
     behind his chair, waiting. Their mother, LORRAINE, a woman of Bembry's 
     age, is seated, but she, too, awaits Bembry.
 
     SHOT - BEMBRY
 
                    BEMBRY 
          In the name of Allah, the beneficent and the 
          merciful to whom all praise is due.
 
     At the window Bembry saying the evening prayers.
 
                    BEMBRY'S VOICE 
          Dear Brother Malcolm: I am back in the bosom of 
          Islam, praise Allah...
 
     He comes to the table, nods and sits. Sidney respectfully sits after 
     him. Food is passed. It is simple fare: natural foods, milk, greens. 
     The portions are small. They eat in silence, but there is warmth and 
     love at this table.
 
                    BEMBRY'S VOICE (contd) 
          ... We don't have much, but what we have is 
          yours. Lorraine and my two sons join with me in 
          saying that when you come out, which will not 
          be too long, come straight to us.
 
123      INT. PRISON BARBER SHOP - DAY
 
     Malcolm is reading Bembry's letter as he waits his turn. There is a 
     WHITE CONVICT in the chair, just being finished by a WHITE BARBER - 
     SIMMONS. A BLACK BARBER - SLIM sits by. Both are convicts. NOTE: 
     Malcolm now wears glasses, all that reading in his badly lit cell has 
     ruined his eyes.
 
                    BEMBRY'S VOICE 
          You write thanking me. Don't thank me. Praise 
          Allah. He did it all.
 
                    SIMMONS 
          Next.
 
     Malcolm starts for the chair. Simmons moves away to light a cigarette 
     as Slim takes over.
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          Dear Bembry. Please thank the Honorable Elijah 
          Muhammad for the money and tell him I have not 
          written him because I have not yet proven 
          myself.
 
124      INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT
 
     Archie and Cadillac are reading a letter they have received. They look 
     at each other incredulously.
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          But I have written everyone else.
 
125     ANOTHER PRISON - DAY
 
     Shorty is waving a letter he has received to his CELLMATE. 

                    SHORTY 
          Look like Homey got himself a brand new hype.
 
126     INT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY
 
     An immaculate room, well furnished. ELIJAH sits in a chair as Bembry
      stands reading Malcolm's letter.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          "I wrote the Mayor, the Governor and the 
          President, but for some reason I haven't heard 
          from them"...
 
     Bembry laughs; Elijah smiles.
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          Tell the Messenger of Allah that I have 
          dedicated my life to telling the white devil 
          the truth to his face. I greet you with the 
          ancient words: "As Salaam Alikum."
 
                    ELIJAH 
          Wa-Alaikum Salaam.
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          P.S. I finally worked my way through the 
          "Z's"...
 
127     INT. PRISON CHAPEL - NIGHT
 
     TITLE - 6 YEARS LATER
 
     A GROUP OF PRISONERS, mostly white, but with a goodly smattering of 
     black convicts, are listening to a lecture by CHAPLAIN GILL.
 
                      CHAPLAIN GILL 
          Are there any questions?
 
     ANGLE. Malcolm seated next to a black convict, raises his hand. It's 
     the only hand up. The Chaplain searches for another questioner, but 
     there aren't any.
 
     Pete, sitting next to Malcolm, whispers.
 
                    PETE
          Watch out, baby, this cat is heavy on religion.
 
 
                    CHAPLAIN GILL 
          I see this has become a struggle between good 
          and evil. Satan has a question.
 
     There is laughter from the convicts.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Yes it is, Chaplain Gill. But I wouldn't want 
          to say which one of us is what.
 
     Laughter, especially from the black convicts.
 
                    CHAPLAIN GILL 
          Why don't you just ask your question?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          You've been talking about the disciples. What 
          color were they?
 
                    CHAPLAIN GILL 
          I don't think we know for certain.
 
     There are reactions from the convicts. Malcolm is sharply challenging a 
     white man about color.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          They were Hebrew, weren't they?
 
                    CHAPLAIN GILL 
          That's right.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
 
                    CHAPLAIN GILL 
          Just what is your question?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What color were the original Hebrews?
 
                    CHAPLAIN GILL 
          I told you we don't know for certain.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Then we don't know that God was white.
 
     There is a strong reaction to this.
 
                    CHAPLAIN GILL 
          Now just a moment, just a moment--
 
                    MALCOLM 
          But we do know that the people of that region 
          of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley 
          to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. 
          I've studied drawings and photographs and seen 
          newsreels. I have never seen a native of that 
          area who was not black.
 
                    CHAPLAIN GILL 
          Just what are you saying?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving 
          to you that God is black.

     (Note: Try to get footage from _The Last Temptation of Christ_ [Willem 
     Dafoe])
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          God is black.
 
128     INT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY
 
     Malcolm opens the door, the room is dark and he sees a small, slight 
     man standing against the window, he doesn't move. This is the same man 
     who appeared in Malcolm's cell, this is the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. 
     Malcolm slowly moves toward him; he is completely humbled in his 
     presence.
 
     CLOSE - ELIJAH
 
     He turns from the window to Malcolm.
 
                    ELIJAH 
          My son, you've been a thief, drug dealer and a
          pimp and the world is still full of temptation. 
          When God bragged how faithful Job was, the 
          devil argued that only God's protective hedge 
          around him kept him pure, the devil said remove 
          the hedge and he will curse his maker. 
          Malcolm, your hedge has been removed and I 
          believe you will remain faithful.
 
     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
     He cannot say anything and he drops his head, he is overwhelmed with 
     heartfelt emotion.
 
129     INT. BEMBRY'S LIVING ROOM - P.M.
 
     In contrast to the peaceful family scene, the room is a beehive of 
     activity. Sidney is turning out leaflets on a mimeograph machine; 
     Lorraine is busy making up a mailing list using 3 x 5 file cards; 
     Bembry is recruiting on the telephone.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          How many you turning out?
 
                    SIDNEY 
          500.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
 
                    SIDNEY 
          Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother 
          Earl. He just joined the Nation.
 
     Earl moves toward Malcolm and extends his hands. Malcolm shakes it 
     warmly.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          We can always use another good brother.
 
                    EARL
          I'm a willing servant for Allah.
 
129A      EXT. CHURCH - DAY
 
     Sunday service has let out and Malcolm, Earl, and Sidney are "fishing." 
     They're trying to convert the Black Christians. Malcolm speaks, while 
     the others hand out leaflets.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          You think you are Christians, and yet you see 
          your so-called white Christian brother hanging 
          black Christians on trees. You say that white 
          man loves you and yet he has done every evil 
          act against you. He has everything while he is 
          living and tells you to be a good slave and 
          when you die you will have more than he has in 
          Beulah's land. We so-called Negroes are in 
          pitiful shape. Get off your knees praying to 
          a picture of a white, pale blond, and blue-eyed 
          Jesus. Come out of the sky. Build heaven on 
          earth. Islam is the black man's true religion.
 
130     EXT. STREET CORNER, 125TH AND SEVENTH AVENUE - DAY 

     Malcolm is talking to a CROWD from a ladder.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          And that the white man is the devil. Yes, God 
          is black and you are made in His image and 
          don't know it. That's how brainwashed you are.

      The crowd is listening, caught up in Malcolm's intensity.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          My brothers and sisters, they tell you you will 
          sprout wings when you die and fly to heaven. 
          The Honorable Elijah Muhammad tells you that's 
          pie in the sky.
 
     ANGLE ON SIDNEY
 
     Amid the listeners, watching their response.
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          Have you ever seen a black man who wasn't down 
          on his knees begging the Lord to give him in 
          heaven what the white devil enjoys right here 
          on earth?
 
     CLOSE SHOT - SEVERAL LISTENERS

     They turn from Malcolm, moving a few steps away, and now are the 
     audience on an adjacent SPEAKER. He is a young firebrand:
 
                    SPEAKER 
          The Harlem Council fights for rat control, for 
          rent control and for community control of our 
          schools.
 
     PAN CONTINUES to take in ANOTHER SPEAKER, a few feet away. WE SEE the 
     street corner is Harlem's Hyde Park, with half a dozen SPEAKERS 
     haranguing the crowd with half a dozen panaceas. That Malcolm is just 
     one among many:

                    SECOND SPEAKER
          If the man behind the counter ain't black, 
          don't go in. Boycott the man. Be black. Think 
          black. Buy black.
 
     ANGLE - MALCOLM
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Come to our Temple and hear the truth. Because, 
          brother and sister, you are dead. Yes you are, 
          mentally dead, spiritually dead, morally dead. 
          And we are here to resurrect the black man 
          back from the dead.
 
131     EXT. OPEN AIR "MAID'S MARKET" - DAY
 
     A place where black women come to offer themselves for day work. 
     SEVERAL ARE SEEN. A WHITE WOMEN comes up to one to interview her 
     (bargain with her). Malcolm's voice is heard before he is seen, 
     speaking to the women from a ladder.
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          My beautiful sister, for you are beautiful. 
          Beautiful because you are black. Because black 
          is beautiful. You work in the white folks' 
          kitchen so I don't have to tell you that 
          they're devils.
 
     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          And you are putting yourselves on the auction 
          block, letting them examine you like a horse, 
          like a slave. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad 
          teaches that you are black and should be 
          proud...
 
     FACE OF ONE BLACK WOMAN, beginning to shake her head in accord.
 
132     INT. TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT
 
     The SAME WOMAN, now at a Muslim meeting. The faces of other listeners 
     (from the church and from the maids' market) are scattered in Malcolm's 
     audience.
 
     The headquarters itself shows the progress Malcolm has made. It is 
     better furnished, larger, and the chairs are filled. Bembry, Sidney, 
     and Lorraine are in the back of the room, pleased with the growth. 
     Malcolm stands at a podium.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          We're not American, we're Africans who happen 
          to be in America. We were kidnapped and brought 
          here against our will from Africa. We didn't 
          land on Plymouth Rock, brothers and sister. 
          Plymouth Rock landed on us.
 
     Reactions: laughter, interest. Ad lib "That's the truth."
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Put an end to your begging. No more "Please, 
          Mr. White Man, Lawdy boss, brush me another 
          crumb from off your table, kindly, sir."  We 
          are a nation, a great nation and don't need a 
          thing from them.
 
     Malcolm scanning the faces of his audience as they react. He sees 
     someone he knows and blurts out boyishly (and winningly):
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Shorty!
 
     The crowd turns to Shorty, sitting embarrassedly in the audience.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Come on up here, man, and give us some skin. 
          Here's a man, brothers and sisters, who shot 
          up with me, who robbed with me, and did time in 
          the white devil's jailhouse. Stand up, Shorty, 
          and be counted--
 
     But Shorty is trying to hide from the spotlight. Malcolm comes down 
     from the platform and walks to him.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Folks, the brother is shy and needs special 
          attention. So would you excuse us, while Brothers 
          Sidney and Earl take up the collection.

     He embraces Shorty as the crowd laughs appreciatively and Brothers 
     Sidney and Earl have a chuckle themselves.
 
133     INT. MUSLIM CAFETERIA - NIGHT
 
     Shortly and Malcolm sit at a table. Shorty has a cup of coffee in front 
     of him.
 
                    SHORTY 
          I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best 
          preacher hype I ever did hear.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I 
          said: join us.
 
                    SHORTY 
          Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should 
          pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
 
                    SHORTY 
          Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How 
          about a snort?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
 
                    SHORTY 
          You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I 
          ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the 
          ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white 
          tail yet.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
 
                    SHORTY 
          Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed 
          with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had 
          twenty-five grand in his pocket.
 
133A      INSERT FLASH - Sammy, he's dead on top of TEENAGE WHORE who is 
     screaming, trying to push that dead weight off her.
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          How about Old Cadillac?
 
133B      INSERT FLASH - Cadillac is an old junkie, past reclaiming, sitting 
     staring in a MENTAL WARD, twitching, nose running.
 
                    SHORTY'S VOICE 
          Hooked on horse. Been in and out of Lexington Ave times.
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          You seen Sophia?
 
133C      INSERT FLASH - Sophia is a bored housewife, she's in the kitchen 
     cooking while her husband hides behind the Wall Street Journal.
 
133D BACK TO THE BAR
 
                    SHORTY 
          I ain't seen Archie, but the vine tells it he's 
          living somewhere's in the Bronx. If you can 
          call it living.
 
134      INT. A DINGY ROOM - DAY
 
     A knock on the door rouses Archie, by now an old and dying man. All the 
     vigor is gone, all the life has ebbed out.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          Git the hell away, you bitch, I'll pay you 
          tomorrow.
 
     Door opens, Malcolm enters.

                      MALCOLM 
          Hello, Archie.

      Archie sits up from his bed and stares. He tries to bring back some of
     his old juice, tries to stand up.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          My man, Red. Come on in, man. 
               (then giving up) 
          Hey, I can't make it.
 
     Malcolm has to help him lie back.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Take it easy, baby.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          That really you, Red?

     The contrast is shocking: Malcolm tall and straight; Archie ruined.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of 
          Harlem. When I think how close we came to 
          gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.

                    ARCHIE 
          I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my 
          rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but 
          did you have that number? Tell me.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is 
          we got to get you back on your feet.
 
                    ARCHIE 
          Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been 
          figured yet. All I need's a stake and a 
          chance--
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, 
          but--
 
                    ARCHIE 
          No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks. 

                    MALCOLM 
          Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
 
                    ARCHIE
          Yeah.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          You could of been something, Archie, but the 
          devil got to you.
 
     The old man is asleep.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          You know all the angles except how to live. 

135      EXT. A STREET IN HARLEM - NIGHT
 
     Malcolm walks thoughtfully down the street; Archie is still on his 
     mind, as he passes prostitute after prostitute. Once beautiful women 
     now selling their bodies. He passes Laura, she has been turned totally 
     out and she looks the part, there is no way he can recognize her. We do 
     though. 

     CLOSE - LAURA
 
     She has just gotten a white John and leads him into an alley.
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          Women who could be mothers, teachers, 
          scientists...

     ANGLE - ALLEY
 
     Laura kneels down to unzip her John's pants.
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE (contd) 
          Who is going to raise our children?; men who 
          might have been astronauts, composers,
          engineers; Who is going to be the head of the 
          households?--
 
136      INT. TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT
 
     Malcolm is addressing a HUGE AUDIENCE. His tone is more intense, more 
     personal than before, because of his recent encounters. In the 
     audience, sitting with Bembry, is BETTY, a lovely dark-skinned woman. 
     Her interest in Malcolm (true, also, for most of the other unmarried 
     sisters) is more than religious.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          --and what has the white devil made of them: 
          dead souls. Oh, my he has no conscience. He 
          should fall on his knees and say, "My kind 
          commits history's greatest crime against your 
          kind every day of your life." But does he? No. 
          He scorns you, splits your head with his 
          nightstick and calls you nigger. If you've had 
          it, then stand up and come forward. If not us, 
          then who? If not now, then when?
 
     ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE
 
     Many stand, some walk toward the podium speaking his name: "I'm with 
     you, Brother Malcolm," "Praise Allah," "Me, Brother Malcolm."
  
     There is applause; some of the audience get to their feet -- Malcolm 
     acknowledges their approval, trying to quiet them, but caught up in the
      heady excitement of leadership.
 
     CLOSE - BETTY AND BEMBRY
 
     Both are moved by Malcolm's performances.
 
                    BETTY
               (whispering) 
          He ought to try to make it a little easier, 
          Brother Bembry.
 
                    BEMBRY 
          Why don't you try telling him that, Sister 
          Betty?
 
137     INT. A LARGE ANTEROOM IN TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT
 
     The Muslim movement has grown enormously. The activity in this 
     anteroom, leading to other rooms off it, shows that. Betty and Bembry 
     stand before a Directory announcing activities in the Temple: MONDAY - 
     Fruit of Islam Meeting; TUESDAY - Unity Night; WEDNESDAY - Student 
     Enrollment; THURSDAY - Muslim Girls Training; FRIDAY - General
     Civilization Class; SATURDAY - Swahili, etc.
 
     A stir of people and activity as Malcolm enters the anteroom. He 
     excuses himself from a group of MUSLIMS, making his way toward Bembry.
 
                    MALCOLM 
               (little out of breath) 
          Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our 
          loudspeaker is heard on the street?
 
                    BEMBRY 
          I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister 
          Betty.
 
     Malcolm nods at her; she nods in return.
 
                    BEMBRY (contd) 
          The Sister lectures our Muslim women in hygiene 
          and diet.
 
     Malcolm mutters "very good," but his mind is clearly on a million other 
     details.
 
                    BEMBRY (contd) 
          The Sister stresses care of the body and 
          regular eating habits.
 
     Malcolm is still distracted.
 
                    BETTY
          The Sister wonders if the Brother knows what 
          Harriet Tubman did between taking souls to the 
          Promised Land?
 
     Malcolm is stopped. He looks at Betty.
 
                     MALCOLM 
          What?
 
                    BETTY
          She ate.
 
     Malcolm laughs.

                    BETTY (contd) 
          And the Sister suggests he put his actions 
          where his mouth is.
 
     Malcolm's laughter is heard, in response.

138      INT. MUSLIM CAFETERIA - NIGHT TWO-SHOT - BETTY AND MALCOLM
 
                     MALCOLM 
          Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard 
          man on women. You want to know why?
 
                    BETTY
          If you want to tell me.
 
                                        CUT TO:
 
138A      EXT. ELIJAH'S GARDEN - DAY
 
     Malcolm sits next to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. The student and the 
     teacher.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          If you want to tell me.
 
                    ELIJAH
          Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy 
          flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied 
          down or messed up by women.

                                        CUT BACK TO:
 
138B      BETTY AND MALCOLM
 
     Betty says nothing, she merely pushes the salad plate a little toward 
     him. The food has thus far gone untouched. Malcolm continues.
 
     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to 
          talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a 
          gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the 
          strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by 
          the woman who slept in his arms.
 
                    BETTY
          Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose 
          marriage?

                                        CUT TO:
 
     CLOSE - ELIJAH
 
                    ELIJAH 
          No. We are not Catholic priests. We do not 
          practice celibacy. If a woman is the right 
          height for a man, the right complexion, if her 
          age is half the man's plus seven, if she 
          understands that man's essential nature is 
          strong and woman's weak, if she loves children, 
          can cook, sew and stay out of trouble--

                                        CUT TO:
 
     CLOSE - BETTY
 
                    BETTY
          I think you've made your points, Brother 
          Malcolm.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What points?
 
                    BETTY
          That you haven't time for either marriage or 
          eating--
 
     Malcolm chuckles a bit.
 
                    BETTY (contd) 
          --and that women aren't the only ones who 
          talk a lot.
 
     Now he bursts out laughing.
 
     CLOSE - BROTHERS SIDNEY AND EARL 

     They are alarmed at Brother Minister's behavior. 

     TWO-SHOT - BETTY AND MALCOLM
 
                    BETTY
          If you'll start eating, there is a question I 
          have. Go ahead. Start.
 
     He takes a forkful of the salad.
 
                    BETTY (contd) 
          Considering today's standards of animal raising 
          and curing meats, I don't fully understand the 
          restriction on pork.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. 
          I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's 
          demonstration purely in the interest of 
          science, you understand?
 
                    BETTY'S VOICE:
          Yes, I understand, Brother Malcolm. Purely 
          scientific.
 
139      INT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY
 
     Before a comparative evolutionary display showing the skeletons of
      various animals, Malcolm is holding forth. Betty is dressed in a vivid, 
     becoming red dress.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Notice especially the claw, the jaw and the 
          skull formation. This is the rat. This the 
          mole. Here you have the aardvark and the 
          boar...
 
     CLOSE ON THE SKELETONS
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          ...All members of the pig-rodent family.
 
                    BETTY
          I see your point.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          So it is not a matter of the breeding 
          conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat 
          itself is foul.
 
     ANGLE. As they saunter out, passing the huge skeletons of prehistoric 
     animals now.
 
                    BETTY
          Could we sit down someplace?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
 
                    BETTY
          You've been on your feet for days. And didn't 
          even finish your salad.

                    WAITER 
          You're the strawberry soda and you're the hot 
          fudge sundae.

     He plunks down the order before Betty and Malcolm. Malcolm takes a 
     long, long satisfying pull on his straw. Then he sighs: 

                    MALCOLM 
          That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
 
                    BETTY
          What?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice 
          cream soda.
 
                    BETTY 
          How do you like it?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Delicious.
 
     She laughs. He blushes.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Let's talk about you for a change.
 
                    BETTY
          There's nothing to talk about.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          0h, yes, there is. I know a lot about you.
          Brother Bembry briefed me.
 
                    BETTY
          Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
 
                    MALCOLM 
               (a beat) 
          You're from Detroit, near where I come from. 
          You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're 
          studying nursing and having trouble with your 
          family.
  
                    BETTY
           I can handle it.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't 
          pay your tuition, isn't that it?
 
                    BETTY
          You have enough worries of your own.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. 
          Tell me something: how tall are you?
 
                    BETTY
          Why do you ask?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Just an idle question.
 
                    BETTY
          If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
 
     She takes a bite of her sundae.
 
                    BETTY (contd) 
          But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a 
          tall man.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          How old are you, Betty?
 
                    BETTY
          There's a few things you don't know about 
          women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and 
          vain.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Are you?
 
                    BETTY
          And dogged when I set my mind to something.
 
                    MALCOLM
          What have you set your mind to?
 
                    BETTY
          Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good 
          wife.
 
     Malcolm takes a good look at the lovely woman in front of him, then a 
     long sip from his ice cream soda.
 
                    SIDNEY'S VOICE 
          Brother Malcolm.
 
     Betty sees him first.
 
                    BETTY
          It's Sidney.
 
     ANGLE. As Sidney runs to them at the table: 

                    SIDNEY 
          Brother Johnson was attacked by the cops.
 
                    A MAN'S VOICE 
          There was a scuffle. The Brother was watching.
 
141     EXT. SIDE STREET IN HARLEM - P.M.

     Malcolm listening as SEVERAL WITNESSES simultaneously describe the 
     attack. A small angry CROWD has gathered. The most animated one is 
     BENJAMIN, a very dark young black teenager, we will soon meet him 
     later.
 
                    BENJAMIN 
          The cop says, "Move on."
 
                    MAN 
          The Brother didn't scatter fast enough for the 
          ofay.
 
     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
                    BENJAMIN 
          Crack. He bled like a stuck hog.
 
                    MAN 
          Watcha gonna do?
 
                    VOICE FROM THE CROWD
               (deprecatingly) 
          He'll rap a little. He's a Muslim. And make a 
          speech.
 
                    ANOTHER VOICE FROM CROWD 
          Muslims talk a good game, but they never do 
          nothing, unless somebody bothers Muslims.

     Malcolm's face goes taut. He nods sharply at Sidney, as Benjamin 
     watches them both.
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          I demand to see Brother Johnson.
 
142      INT. POLICE STATION - LATE P.M.

     Malcolm facing a DESK SERGEANT, TWO UNIFORMED COPS and a PLAINCLOTHESMAN
     off to one side.
 
                    SERGEANT 
          Who the hell are you?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I'm from Muslim Temple 7.
 
                    COP 
          Never heard of you.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Where is he?
 
     The police respond with a squeeze play intended to intimidate Malcolm:
 
                    SERGEANT 
          Nobody here by that name.
 
                    PLAINCLOTHES 
          What's your name, feller?
 
     He feels the power play and stiffens in resistance.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him 
          brought in. He was not brought out.
 
                    PLAINCLOTHES 
          You heard the Sergeant. Outside.
 
     Malcolm stands his ground coolly.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Take a look out that window. I intend to see 
          Brother Johnson.
 
     The cops eye each other. Plainclothes walks to the window. 

143     EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE - LATE P.M.
 
     Across from the station is a phalanx of some FIFTY MEN of the Fruit 
     of Islam. All are dressed in dark suits with white shirts. They stand 
     in military formation: eyes forward, every face burning. People from 
     the neighborhood have formed a crowd behind and around them. WE MAKE 
     OUT Benjamin among the crowd. 

143A     INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
 
                    PLAINCLOTHES 
          Who the hell are they?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Brothers of Brother Johnson.
 
                    PLAINCLOTHES 
          Eddie, let's see that blotter.
 
     TWO-SHOT - FAVOR MALCOLM
 
     As the cops examine the police blotter.
 
                    SERGEANT
          Yeah. We got a Muslim. The relief must of put it 
          down.
 
                    PLAINCLOTHES 
          But you can't see him. You ain't his lawyer.
 
                    SERGEANT 
          No lawyer, no see.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Until I'm satisfied Brother Johnson is 
          receiving proper medical attention, no one will 
          move.
 
     Cops eye each other. Plainclothes nods slightly, he has to give in, 
     Malcolm is not playing.
 
144     INT. A LOCKUP - SAME
 
     The back of Malcolm's head, as he examines Brother Johnson. As he comes 
     up OUT OF FRAME, WE SEE that Johnson has been badly beaten.
 
                    MALCOLM 
               (shaking) 
          Only a pig could do a thing like that.
 
                    PLAINCLOTHES 
          Watch your tongue, boy.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Don't you call me boy, you pig. Letting a man 
          bleed like that.
 
     Sergeant puts a restraining hand on Plainclothes.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          That man belongs in a hospital. Get an ambulance. 
          Now! 

145      EXT. THE STREET - LATER (DARKER)
 
     As Johnson's body, on a stretcher, is hurried into an ambulance. The 
     crowd has grown in proportions. There are ad libs: "Goddam pigs," "Damn 
     police brutality," "Least they got him out of the meat house."
 
     Malcolm with the Sergeant and a LIEUTENANT, as the ambulance pulls away.
 
                    LIEUTENANT
          All right, break it up. You got what you wanted.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I'm not satisfied.
 
     Malcolm starts walking down the center of the street, after the 
     ambulance.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          To the hospital.
 
     The Fruit of Islam fall in behind him, marching slowly. It takes on the 
     start of a march as the neighborhood people fall in behind them. People 
     (especially kids) race with them on the street and on the sidewalk.
 
     ANGLE - BENJAMIN
 
     Benjamin fights his way through the crowd trying to walk beside Malcolm, 
     the Brothers in the Fruit stop him and Benjamin drops back.
 
146      EXT. LENOX AVENUE - NIGHT
 
      Now the march has taken over the broad avenue. COPS are forced to 
     redirect traffic, holding up crosstown cars as the group walks solemnly 
     by. The people walking behind have swelled it to a huge demonstration. 
     Their faces reflect their anger and their satisfaction that, for once, 
     something is being done about what has happened.
 
147      EXT. HARLEM HOSPITAL - NIGHT
 
     LONG SHOT SHOWS the Muslim men in perfect order, calm with their arms 
     folded across their chests, waiting. Their eyes are on Malcolm as he 
     walks toward the hospital entrance. 

     SHOTS

     --of the growing crowd.

     --of the nervous cops, including some big brass.
 
     --of kids watching from a rooftop.

     --of Benjamin trying to emulate the Fruit of Islam. 

148     EXT. OUTSIDE HARLEM HOSPITAL - NIGHT 

     Malcolm is standing in front of the Fruit of Islam men, as HIGHRANKING 
     POLICE OFFICER GREEN comes over.
 
                    CAPTAIN GREEN
          All right, that's enough. I want these people 
          moved out of here.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          They're all disciplined men. They're doing 
          nothing except waiting.
 
     SHOT
 
     The unruly crowd behind the Fruit of Islam. They are restive, milling, 
     ugly.
 
                    CAPTAIN GREEN 
          What about them?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          That's your headache, Captain. And if he dies, 
          I pity you.
 
149     EXT. OUTSIDE HARLEM HOSPITAL - NIGHT
 
                    DOCTOR 
          He'll live. He's getting the best care we can 
          give.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Thank you, Doctor.
 
                    DOCTOR 
          I had to put a plate in his head.
 
                    MALCOLM 
               (to Captain) 
          You bastards.
 
                    CAPTAIN GREEN 
          All right, okay. Now disperse this mob.
 
     MEDIUM SHOT - MALCOLM, FRUIT OF ISLAM AND CROWD 

     It's clear the decision is in one man's hands, Malcolm's. 

     CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM 

     He makes a gesture with his hand, the Fruit of Islam disperse.
 
     ANGLE. People moving away, going home. Only one person remains from the 
     Fruit of Islam and the crowd, it's Benjamin.
 
     CLOSE - CAPTAIN GREEN
 
                    CAPTAIN GREEN 
          That's too much power for one man to have.
 
149A      INT. MUSLIM CAFETERIA - NIGHT
 
     Everyone is in a somber mood over the evening's events. 

     ANGLE - TABLE 

     Malcolm sits with Brothers Earl and Sidney.
 
                    SIDNEY 
          Brother Minister, we need to strike back.
 
                    BROTHER EARL 
          Put fear into those devils.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I want to also, but until we are instructed by 
          the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and 
          pray.
 
                    BROTHER EARL 
          I'm tired of praying.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          That's enough, Brother Earl.
 
     ANGLE - ENTRANCE
 
     Benjamin comes into the cafeteria and everyone looks at him. He sees 
     Malcolm sitting and moves toward his table.
 
     ANGLE - TABLE 

     Brothers Sidney and Earl get up to intercept him but Malcolm waves him 
     through. Benjamin stands.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Sit down, son.
 
     Malcolm pours some cream into his cup of black coffee, then also some 
     white sugar.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          There is only one thing I like integrated. My 
          coffee.
 
     Benjamin laughs.

                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          What can I do for you?
 
                    BENJAMIN
          Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you 
          did. I want to be a Muslim. I ain't never seen 
          a Negro stand up to the police like that.
 
     ANGLE - SIDNEY AND EARL
 
     They exchange dubious looks.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Do you know what it means to be a true Muslim?
 
     Benjamin hesitates.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Do you?
 
                    BENJAMIN 
          Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I admire your enthusiasm but you should never 
          join any organization without first checking it 
          out thoroughly.
 
     Benjamin is crushed and he starts to get up.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          We need more young warriors like yourself, 
          stick around and we shall see if your heart is 
          true.
 
                    BENJAMIN 
          Mr. X, I won't make you out a liar.

     MALCOLM X WINS $70,000 JUDGMENT FOR BEATEN NEGRO 

     An AIDE of Elijah puts down the newspaper and shakes Malcolm's hand.
 
                    AIDE
          The Honorable Elijah Muhammad would like to see 
          you now.
 
151     INT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY
 
     Elijah is sweeping the floor with a plain hand broom. Malcolm enters 
     the room, is surprised and waits at the door. The two are alone 
     together.
 
                    ELIJAH
          If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work 
          teaches us humility.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Let me do it then.
 
                    ELIJAH 
          No, each of us must relearn that work is the 
          only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a 
          great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting 
          that we are nothing, while He is all.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Allah Akbar.
 
     The sweeping done, they stand together near a table at a window.
 
                    ELIJAH
          Tonight I shall introduce you as my National 
          Representative. It will be a difficult task. 
          Your assignment is to build temples all over 
          this nation. More work than you have ever done 
          in your life and you will be in the public eye. 
          My son, beware of those cameras, they are just 
          as bad as a narcotic.

     ANGLE - AIDES and OTHERS come into the room now. They are listening.

                    ELIJAH (contd) 
          Yes, the white devil will watch your every 
          step. Even your own Brothers will become 
          jealous, and hostile, go slowly. So I offer you 
          a parable -- regarding your work.
 
     Elijah picks up a glass and sets it before Malcolm.
 
                    ELIJAH (contd) 
          Here is a glass, dirty and its water foul. If 
          you offer it to the people and they have no 
          choice, they must drink out of it. But if you 
          present them with this glass--
 
     He is holding a clean glass, with clear water in it.
 
                    ELIJAH (contd) 
          --and let them make their decision, they will 
          choose the pure vessel. Islam is the only 
          religion which addresses the needs and problems 
          of the so-called Negro, especially in the 
          ghettos -- Islam is the only way out from drugs, 
          crime, unemployment, prostitution, alcohol, 
          gambling, fornication and adultery.
 
     Elijah holds up the clear glass.
 
                    VOICE OF MALCOLM X 
          This sweet, gentle man gave me the truth from 
          his own mouth. And I adored him, in the sense 
          of the Latin root of the word. Adorare, to 
          worship and to fear. He was the first man I 
          ever feared -- not fear such as the one has of 
          a gun but the fear one has of the power of the 
          sun, I pledged myself to him, even if it cost 
          me my life.

          Yes.

          Did you hear what I said?
 
                    BETTY
          Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I think so. Can you catch a plane?
 
                    BETTY
          Yes. Did you eat?

     Betty and Malcolm sit on the floor in the dimlit room, very close.

          It won't be easy.
 
                    BETTY
          Just hold me.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          It will be rough.
 
                    BETTY
          Hush your mouth.

          You're with me even when you're away.
 
     He embraces her. Then Betty laughs.
 
                    BETTY (contd) 
          I never told you, but when I first saw you on 
          the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry 
          for you. Nobody as young as you should be that 
          serious. But I don't think that anymore.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What do you think?
 
                    BETTY
          The simplest thing in the world: I want to have 
          a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love 
          you.

     Full embrace.

155     INT. BEMBRY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
 
     Malcolm has just cut the cake and handed a slice to Betty. Amid 
     laughter and great warmth, Sidney unfurls the front page of the 
     _Messenger_, the Muslim newspaper. Headline reads: "MALCOLM X WEDS 
     BETTY SAUNDERS." Betty kisses her husband and Bembry, Lorraine, Earl, 
     Sidney, Peter and VARIOUS BROTHERS AND SISTERS applaud.
 
     We notice the subtle change in the apartment: it is more comfortable; 
     there is even evidence of some small luxury: a TV set, a new settee, 
     etc.

156     EXT. RALLY - HARLEM - DAY 

     Malcolm is speaking to a GOOD SIZED AUDIENCE:
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I must emphasize at the outstart, that the 
          Honorable Elijah Muhammad is not a politician, 
          so I'm not here this afternoon as a Republican, 
          nor a Democrat, not as a Mason nor an Elk, not 
          as a Christian nor a Jew, not as a Catholic nor 
          a Protestant, not as a Baptist nor a Methodist, 
          not even as an American. For if I was an 
          American the problem that confronts our people 
          today would not exist. So I stand here as what 
          I was when I was born: A BLACK MAN!
 
     CROWD REACTIONS
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Before there were any such things as Democrats 
          or Republicans, we were black. Before there 
          were any such things as Masons or Elks, we
          were black. Before there were any such things 
          as Jews or Christians, we were black people. In 
          fact long before there was ever any such place 
          as America, we were black people... And after 
          America has long passed from the scene there 
          will still be BLACK PEOPLE.

     This is a larger audience.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What kind of black people does the Honorable 
          Elijah Muhammad speak for? Black people who are 
          jobless... the black masses who are poor, 
          hungry, and angry, the black masses who are 
          dissatisfied with the slums and ghettos in 
          which we have been forced to live... the black 
          masses who are tired of listening to the 
          promises of white politicians to correct the 
          miserable living conditions that exist in our 
          community... the black masses that are sick of 
          the inhuman acts of bestial brutality practiced 
          by these semi-savage white policemen that 
          patrol our community, like the occupation 
          forces of a conquering enemy army... the black 
          masses who are fed up with the anemic, Uncle 
          Tom leadership set up by the white man to act 
          as a spokesman for our people and to KEEP US 
          SATISFIED AND PACIFIED WITH NOTHING!

                    MALCOLM 
          If the black man cannot go back to his own 
          people and his own land, Elijah Muhammad is 
          asking that a part of the United States be 
          separated and given to the Muslims so they can 
          live separately.
 
     CLOSE - ELIJAH
 
                    MALCOLM (contd)

          of problems of the so-called Negro...

158J
                    MALCOLM/HIS VOICE 
          The white people who are guilty of white 
          supremacy try and hide their own guilt by 
          accusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of 
          teaching black supremacy when he tries to 
          uplift the mentality, the social, and economic 
          condition of black people in this country. And 
          the Jews, who have been guilty of exploiting 
          the black people economically, civilly, and 
          otherwise, hide their guilt by accusing the 
          Honorable Elijah Muhammad of being anti-Semitic 
          simply because he teaches our people to go into 
          business for ourselves and trying to take over 
          the economic leadership in our own community. 
          The black people in this country have been the 
          victims of violence at the hands of the white 
          man for 400 years, and following the ignorant 
          Negro preachers, we have thought that it was 
          God-like to turn the other cheek to the brute 
          that was brutalizing us. 100 years ago they 
          use to put on a white sheet and use a 
          bloodhound against Negroes. Today they've taken
          off sheets and put on police uniforms, they've 
          traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs. And 
          just as Uncle Tom back during slavery used to 
          keep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhounds 
          or resisting the Ku Klux Klan by telling them 
          to love their enemy or pray for those who use 
          them as spitefully today. The Honorable Elijah 
          Muhammad is showing black people that just as 
          the white man and every other person on this 
          earth has God given rights, natural rights, 
          civil rights, and any other kind of rights that 
          you can think of when it comes to defending 
          himself.

     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Yes sir. As you know, during slavery time, the 
          slavemasters named most of the so-called 
          Negroes in America after themselves. Mr. Elijah 
          Muhammad teaches us once you come into the 
          knowledge of Islam, you replace your slave name 
          with an X. Since we've been disconnected, cut 
          off from our Eastern culture for so long that 
          we don't know the names we originally had, we 
          will use X until we get back to the East.

          Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so 
          he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good

          Please, go ahead.
 
                    DR. PAYSON 
          Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black 
          supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
 
     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
                    MALCOLM 
          For the white man to ask the black man if he 
          hates him is just like the rapist asking the 
          raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you 
          hate me!" The white man is in no moral position 
          to accuse anyone of hate.
 
     ANGLE - PANEL
 
                    MODERATOR
          Certainly, Mr. X, you must admit there has been 
          progress.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I'll talk about "progress" in a minute, but let 
          me finish with my brother.

     Malcolm gestures to the Negro panelist.  The BLACK MEMBERS of the TV 
     audience are lapping it up. Betty and Earl also sit in the TV studio 
     audience.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." 
          I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
 
                    DR. PAYSON 
          You put it very well.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          You left one phrase out. Another educated 
          Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother 
          Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices 
          of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
 
                    DR. PAYSON 
          Entirely.
 
     ANGLE - MALCOLM
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a 
          Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is 
          called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's 
          called a nigger.
 
     There is some blanching and guffawing from the audience. The moderator 
     is totally embarrassed, Betty roars.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          And I'm not finished. To understand this man--
 
     He points a sharp finger at the Negro Panelist.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          --you must know that historically there are two 
          kinds of slaves. House Negroes and Field 
          Negroes. The house Negro lived in the big 
          house; he dressed pretty good; he ate pretty 
          good and he loved the master. Yeah, he loved 
          him more than the master loved himself. If the 
          master's house caught fire, he'd be the first 
          to put the blaze out. If the master got sick, 
          he'd say: "What's a matter, boss; we sick?" 
          WE sick! If someone said to him, "Let's run 
          away and escape. Let's separate." He'd say, 
          "Man, are you crazy? What's better than what I 
          got here?" That was the House Negro. In those 
          days he was called the House Nigger. Well, 
          that's what we call them today because we still 
          got a lot of House Niggers running around.
 
     There is applause from the blacks in the audience. Moderator tries to 
     regain control.

                    MODERATOR
          I think, perhaps, Dr. Payson has something to--
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Don't you want to hear about the Field Nigger?
 
                    DR. PAYSON 
          Let him finish.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught 
          hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; 
          he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and 
          hated his master. If the house caught fire, 
          he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, 
          he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to 
          him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, 
          "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." 
          You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America 
          today. I'm one.
 
                    BROTHER BENJAMIN 
          Tell it.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          --there's another one. The majority of black 
          Americans today are Field Negroes. They don't 
          talk about OUR progress, about OUR government, 
          OUR navy, OUR astronauts. Hell, they won't

     EXT. STREET - HARLEM - DAY 

     Malcolm is walking the streets of Harlem like he is campaigning for 
     office. He has Brothers Sidney, Earl, and Benjamin at his side, a CROWD 
     follows him. Malcolm sees a WINO.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Brother Man, put that bottle down, take that 
          poison away from your lips. That's what the 
          devil wants you to do, stay high, out of your 
          natural mind. I know, I've been there.
 
     The wino looks at Malcolm and continues to drink his wine.

          It's time you received your X. But first you 
          must copy this letter, exactly as I give it to 
          you; down to the dotted "i's," crossed "t's," 
          everything. And you must go on a fast, just 
          water and juices, that's it.

                    MALCOLM 
          Brother Benjamin, do not rush, it has to be 
          exact.
 
     --Benjamin goes off in a corner and very quickly copies the letter, 
     he's so anxious.
 
     --Benjamin hands Malcolm his letter, Malcolm shakes his head and hands 
     it back, it's not exact.

     Malcolm hands him back his letter again. The fast is getting to 
     Benjamin.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          When you have poor schools you have poor

          Poor education, you only work on poor paying

160     EXT. HARVARD SQUARE - DAY
 
     A CROWD OF STUDENTS outside the Law School. The setting is the same as 
     the last time we saw Malcolm and Shorty here, except now the students 
     part for him. Malcolm walks slowly toward the entrance, looking up at 
     the Latin inscription of the building when he is stopped by a WHITE 
     COED.
 
                    COED
          Mr. X, I've read some of your speeches and I 
          honestly believe a lot of what you say has 
          truth to it. I have a good heart. I'm a good 
          person despite my whiteness. What can the good 
          white people like myself, who are not 
          prejudiced, or racist, what can we do to help 
          the cause?

     He stares at her.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Nothing!
 
     CLOSE - COED

     She is absolutely crushed and runs away in tears. 

161      INT. HARVARD LAW SCHOOL - DAY 

     Speaking to a packed STUDENT AUDIENCE. 

                    MALCOLM 
          ...My high school was the black ghetto of 
          Roxbury. My college was the streets of Harlem, 
          and I took my masters in prison. If you look 
          out the window--

161A      SHOT MALCOLM'S OLD GANG HANGOUT
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          --you can see my burglary hangout. I lived 
          like an animal. Had it not been for the 
          Honorable Elijah Muhammad I would surely be in 
          an insane asylum or dead.
 
     ANGLE - The audience carefully listening.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Mr. Muhammad is trying to get us on God's side, 
          so God will be on our side to help us fight our 
          battles. When Negroes stop getting drunk, stop 
          being addicted to drugs, stop fornicating and
          committing adultery. When we get off the 
          welfare, then we'll be MEN. Earn what you need 
          for your family, then your family respects you. 
          They'll be proud to say "That's my father." 
          She's proud to say "That's my husband..." 
          Father means you're taking care of those 
          children. Just 'cause you made them that don't 
          mean you're a father. Anybody can make a baby, 
          but anybody can't take care of them. Anyone can 
          go and get a woman but anybody can't take care 
          of a woman. This is the type of teaching that 
          the honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us so we 
          can build the moral fiber of our people.
 
     SHOT OF REPORTERS IN AUDIENCE
 
     Beginning to scribble furiously.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I can see the gentlemen of the press, also the 
          FBI and CIA. are with us. Get it straight 'cuz 
          if I said, "Mary had a little lamb," they'd 
          write Malcolm X lampoons poor Mary.
 
     Loud laughter from the audience. But this response is overwhelmed by 
     the response of ANOTHER, LARGER AUDIENCE.
 
162     INT. MONSTER RALLY - NIGHT 

     Malcolm is talking before an all-black audience. It is the largest 
     rally yet; the hall is packed to the rafters.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          We have built temples in Boston, in Detroit, in 
          Atlanta, Philadelphia, Washington -- 100 
          temples in fifty states. From a handful we 
          have grown to scores of thousands.
 
     VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE RALLY 

     HAWKERS selling _The Messenger_, faces of Fruit of Islam near the 
     podium; Lorraine, Sidney, Earl, Benjamin, and Bembry. For the first 
     time a new note is seen in Bembry's face: reserve bordering on 
     resentment. When others around him cheer Malcolm, Bembry is cool. 
     Sidney notices this from his father, but makes no comment.

                    MALCOLM/HIS VOICE 
          The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that 
          God is now about to establish a kingdom on this 
          earth based on brotherhood and 

          [...]

          against peace, his history on this earth has 
          proved that. Nowhere in history has he been 
          brotherly toward anyone. The only time he has 
          been brotherly toward you is when he can use 
          you, when he can exploit you, when he can 
          oppress you, when you will submit to him. And 
          since his own history makes him unqualified to 
          be an inhabitant or a citizen in a kingdom of 
          brotherhood, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad 
          teaches us that God is about to eliminate that 
          particular race from this earth. So since they 
          are due for elimination, we don't want to be 
          with them.
 
     ANGLE - CROWD
 
     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          If the so-called Negro were American citizens 
          we wouldn't have a race problem. If the 
          Emancipation Proclamation was authentic, you 
          wouldn't have a race problem. If the 13th, 
          14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution 
          was authentic, you wouldn't have a race 
          problem. If the Supreme Court desegregation 
          decision was authentic, you wouldn't have a 
          race problem. All of this is hypocrisy. These 
          Negro leaders have been telling the white man 
          everything is all right, everything is under 
          control. And they've been telling the white man 
          that Mr. Muhammad is wrong, don't listen to 
          him. But everything Mr. Muhammad has been 
          saying is going to come to pass is now coming 
          to pass and now the Negro leaders are standing 
          up saying that we are about to have a racial 
          explosion. We're going to have a racial 
          explosion and that's more dangerous than an 
          atomic explosion.
 
     ANGLE - MALCOLM
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          It's going to explode because black people are 
          dissatisfied. They're dissatisfied now not only 
          with the white man, but with these Negroes who 
          have been sitting around here posing as leaders 
          and spokesmen for black people. Anytime you put 
          too many sparks around a powder keg, the thing 
          is going to explode and if the thing that 
          explodes is still inside the house, then the 
          house will be destroyed. So the Honorable 
          Elijah Muhammad is telling the white man get 
          this powder keg out of your house, let the 
          black people in this country separate from him 
          while there's still time. And if the black man 
          is allowed to separate and go on onto some land 
          of his own, where he can solve his problems, 
          then there won't be any explosion. COMPLETE 
          SEPARATION IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE BLACK 
          AND WHITE PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY!!!

     ANGLE - CROWD
 
     A wave of cheers as people explode.
 
163      INT. AN ANTEROOM OF THE RALLY - NIGHT
 
     The rally is over. A small room packed with PEOPLE congratulating 
     Malcolm, trying to touch him. He is the hero of the hour. Sidney, Earl, 
     and Benjamin with him, enjoying the accolades and trying to help 
     Malcolm make his way out. Bembry stands apart, removed and silent.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
 
                    SIDNEY 
          Please make way, please--
 
     ANGLE. A WELL-KNOWN PERSONALITY (DICK GREGORY) is at the door. He and 
     Malcolm know each other well. Malcolm extends a palm, but Gregory 
     doesn't slap it.
 
                    GREGORY 
          Can I ask you something?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Sure, man.
 
                    GREGORY 
          Are you Elijah's pimp?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What?
 
                    GREGORY 
               (scornfully) 
          "His greatest greatness."
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Say what you're saying.
 
                    GREGORY 
          If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest 
          for you.
 
164      INT. MALCOLM'S HOME - NIGHT
 
     Betty, pregnant with child, is in a chair -- a newspaper in her lap. 
     Malcolm is in the other room, putting his last daughter to sleep. We 
     hear him...
 
     ANGLE - BEDROOM
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          Okay, last hug.
 
     As he enters, a smile on his face, but the concern of the evening 
     clearly imprinted. He sits down heavily. Betty watches him carefully.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Long day. Long night. Long year. Long ten years.
 
     He smiles. She doesn't.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          Why are you looking at me like that?
 
                    BETTY
          Because you're in trouble.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          How do you know?
 
     She smiles.

                    BETTY
          Dear heart, because I know you.
 
     A pause.

                    MALCOLM 
          I don't want to bring my troubles home. You 
          know that.
 
                    BETTY
          I'm not made of glass.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I just want to sit here and be still.

                    BETTY
          We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But 
          we're going to have one right now if you don't
          talk about it.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Talk about what?
 
                    BETTY
          The talk is everywhere!
 
                    MALCOLM 
          There's always talk, always been talk, and 
          always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm 
          trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting 
          rich off the Nation?
 
                    BETTY
          We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just 
          talk any more.
 
     She picks up the newspaper and reads from it:
 
                    BETTY (contd) 
          "Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old 
          leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today 
          faced paternity suits from two former 
          secretaries who charged he fathered their four 
          children..."
 
                    MALCOLM 
          There are always slanders, always lies. You're 
          reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're 
          trying to bring us down, bring down the 
          Messenger.
 
                    BETTY
          "Both women, in their 20's, charged they had 
          had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 
          1957..."
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
 
                    BETTY
          To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the 
          matter with you?
 
     Betty gets up, goes to him gently.
 
                    BETTY
          No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are 
          you so dedicated that you have blinded 
          yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face 
          the truth? Bembry is the editor of the 
          newspaper you established. Ask him why your 
          name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a 
          year? Ask him why you rate front page in every 
          paper in the country, but not a single sentence 
          in your own.
 
                    MALCOLM 
               (rationalizing) 
          I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our 
          people know what I'm doing.
 
                    BETTY
          Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so 
          blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah 
          Muhammad saved my life.
 
                    BETTY
          A long time ago. You've repaid them many times 
          over. Ask them why they have new cars and 
          houses full of new furniture.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
 
                    BETTY
          What do we have, Malcolm. A broken-down jalopy 
          and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own 
          our own home. What about our children? What 
          about me? You don't even own life insurance.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          The Nation will provide for you and the 
          children if anything happens to me.
 
                    BETTY
          Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are 
          you blind?
 
     She touches him very gently.
 
                    BETTY (contd)
          Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising 
          our kids practically by myself, while you're 
          running all over the world. You don't know how 
          many times the girls ask me when is daddy 
          coming home?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
 
                    BETTY
          We need you too!
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What do you want me to do?
 
                    BETTY 
          Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a 
          day; but the possibility of betrayal never 
          enters your mind. If you won't do that for 
          yourself do it for us.

     PAN TO BEMBRY
 
                    BEMBRY 
          What are you talking about -- "blackout"? Some 
          of the Brothers are a little jealous. Maybe 
          they think you been a little -- overpublicized. 
          That's all. Forget it. It's nothing.
 
     Malcolm is listening closely. Bembry puts an arm around him, man-to-man.
 
                    BEMBRY (contd) 
          Now about our coming up in the world a little. 
          You're not naive. You're a man of the world. 
          The Movement's grown; we've grown with it. You 
          know folks. They want their leaders to be 
          prosperous. One hand washes the other.

          We tell the world we're moral leaders because 
          we follow the personal example of the Honorable 
          Elijah Muhammad. It's hard to make a rooster 
          stop crowing once the sun has risen. The sun is 
          up.
 
     We hear rifle shots.

     Malcolm, a last-minute replacement for the ailing Honorable Elijah 
     Muhammad, speaks before a HUGE CROWD.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          And what do I say of this so-called national 
          mourning! I say... the white man's acts are 
          condemned, not only by our beliefs but by his 
          own.

          Both his Bible and the Holy Koran say: "As you 
          sow, so shall you reap." Both say: "Sow the 
          wind, reap the whirl wind."

          the seeds of hate. He allowed the weeds that 
          sprang up to choke the life out of thousands 
          of black men.

          Minister X! Don't you have even a little bit of 
          remorse... saddened by President Kennedy's 
          assassination?
 
     CLOSE - MALCOLM
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Assassination might be too good a word, and 
          might I add an Arabic word at that. This was a 
          prime example of the devil's chickens coming 
          home to roost. Being an old farm boy myself, 
          chickens coming home to roost never did make 
          me sad. It always made me glad.
 
169A     INT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY

     On his desk is the black headlines: MALCOLM X CALLS ASSASSINATION 
     "CHICKENS COMING HOME TO ROOST." Elijah's health is getting worse, his 
     coughing is frequent.
 
                    ELIJAH
          Did you see the papers today?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Yes, sir, I did.
 
                    ELIJAH 
          That was a very bad statement. The country 
          loved this man, and you have made it hard in 
          general for Muslims.

          ninety days. You are not allowed to make any 
          statements to the press nor are you to speak at 
          any temples.

          C'mon girls, it's bedtime.

     The phone rings. Malcolm answers it. From his expression we know it is 
     a threat call. He hangs up. Betty leaves with the kids.
 
                    SIDNEY 
          Another one? 

                    MALCOLM 
          How long has this been going on?
 
                    SIDNEY 
          All day since you and Betty left. Brother 
          Minister, I have to level with you. They gave 
          me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love 
          y'all.

                    MALCOLM 
          What mission?

                    SIDNEY 
          To wire your car so it would explode when you 
          turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are 
          spreading untruths about the Messenger. The 
          Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, 
          Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue 
          should be cut out and delivered to the 
          Messenger's doorstep.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          What does Sidney say?
 
                    SIDNEY 
          I'm with you, Brother Minister.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          No. You'll be marked for death.
 
                    SIDNEY 
          Let me die then.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I won't let myself come between you and your 
          father. Go home.
 
                    SIDNEY
          You're my father.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          And don't come back.
 
     Sidney reluctantly leaves, walks out the door, past Betty. She looks at 
     him, then Malcolm.
 
173      INT. HOTEL THERESA - DAY
 
     Malcolm -- backed by Brothers Earl and Benjamin 2X -- faces a roomful 
     of SUPPORTERS and REPORTERS.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Because 1964 threatens to be a very explosive 
          year on the racial front, and because I myself 
          intend to be very active in every phase of the 
          American Negro struggle for HUMAN RIGHTS, I 
          have called this press conference, this 
          morning in order to clarify my own position in 
          the struggle -- especially in regards to 
          politics and nonviolence. In the past I thought 
          the thoughts, spoke the words of the Honorable 
          Elijah Muhammad, that day is over. From now on 
          I speak my own words, and think my own thoughts. 
          Internal differences within the Nation of Islam 
          forced me out of it. I did not leave of my own 
          free will. But now that it has happened, I 
          intend to make the most of it. Now that I have 
          more independence of action, I intend to use a 
          more flexible approach toward working with 
          others to get a solution to this problem. I do 
          not pretend to be a divine man, but I do 
          believe in divine guidance, divine power, and 
          in the fulfillment of divine prophecy. I am not 
          educated, nor am I an expert in any particular 
          field, but I am sincere, and my sincerity is my 
          credentials. I'm not out to fight other Negro 
          leaders or organizations. We must find a common 
          solution, to a common problem. I am going to 
          organize and head a new mosque in New York 
          City, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This 
          gives us a religious base, and the spiritual 
          force necessary to rid our people of the vices 
          that destroy the moral fiber of our community. 
          Our political philosophy will be black 
          nationalism. Our economic and social philosophy 
          will be black nationalism. The Muslim Mosque, 
          Inc. will remain wide open for ideas and 
          financial aid from all quarters. Whites can 
          help us, but they can't join us. There can be 
          no black-white unity until there is first some 
          black unity.

     A host of questions fired all at once: How many of Elijah's followers
     will join you? etc, etc, etc.
 
     Malcolm calms them:
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          There is one further preparation I need. It is 
          a return to the source of our great religion. I 
          will make a pilgrimage to Mecca.

     --Malcolm, wearing the garb of a pilgrim, walks with a VAST THRONG OF 
     OTHERS, similarly clad, around the Great Temple. He wears two white 
     towels, one over his loins, the other over his neck and shoulder, 
     leaving the right arm and shoulder bare. He wears simple sandals. The 
     other pilgrims are of various colors: from white, to yellow, to darkest 
     black.

     in the middle of the Great Mosque. He falls to his knees. WE SEE what 
     he describes:
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          Today, with thousands of others, I proclaimed 
          God's greatness in the Holy City of Mecca. 
          Wearing the Ihram garb I made my seven circuits 
          around the Kaaba; I drank from the well of Zem 
          Zem; I prayed to Allah from Mt. Ararat where 
          the Ark landed. It was the only time in my life 
          that I stood before the Creator of all and felt 
          like a complete human being.

     Elijah and a GROUP OF BLACK MUSLIM LEADERS. Bembry among them, it looks 
     like he is the number two man now that Malcolm has been jettisoned. The 
     Messenger lies in bed, he is having a coughing fit, this is the worst 
     condition he's been in. A DOCTOR orders everyone out the room.
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          You may be shocked by these words, but I have 
          eaten from the same plate, drunk from the same 
          glass and prayed to the same God with fellow 
          Muslims whose eyes were blue, whose hair was 
          blond and whose skin was the whitest of whites. 
          And we are brothers, truly; people of all 
          colors and races believing in One God and one 
          humanity. Once before, in prison, the truth 
          came and blinded me. It has happened again...

     now four including another BABY - GAMILAH
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          In the past, I have permitted myself to be used 
          to make sweeping indictments of all white 
          people, and these generalizations have caused 
          injuries to some white folks who did not 
          deserve them. Because of the spiritual rebirth 
          which I was blessed to undergo as a result of 
          my pilgrimage to the Holy City of Mecca, I no 
          longer subscribe to sweeping indictments of 
          one race. I intend to be careful not to 
          sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty. 
          I'm not a racist and do not subscribe to any of 
          the tenets of racism. In all honesty and 
          sincerity it can be stated that I wish nothing 
          but freedom, justice and equality: life, 
          liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all 
          people.
 
179A      SHOT. Malcolm is bent over in prayer, lone figure in a huge mosque.
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE
          My first concern, of course, is with the group 
          to which I belong, the Afro-Americans, for we, 
          more than any other, are deprived of these 
          inalienable rights.
 
179B      SHOT. Malcolm on a plane headed home.
 
                    MALCOLM'S VOICE 
          I believe the true practice of Islam can remove 
          the cancer of racism from the hearts and souls 
          of white Americans.

                    MALCOLM 
          Let's begin.
 
                    REPORTER #1 
          Malcolm, you said on your trip abroad you 
          sensed a feeling of great brotherhood.
 
                    MALCOLM 
          As I recall, I pointed out that while I was in 
          Mecca making the pilgrimage, I spoke about the 
          brotherhood that existed at all levels among 
          all people, all colors who had accepted the 
          religion of Islam. I pointed out that what it 
          had done, Islam, for those people despite their 
          complexion differences, that it would probably 
          do America well to study the religion of Islam 
          and perhaps it could drive some of the racism 
          from this society. Muslims look upon themselves 
          as human beings, as part of the human family 
          and therefore look upon all other segments of 
          the human family as part of that same family. 
          Today my friends are black, brown, red, yellow 
          and white.
 
                    REPORTER #8 
          Malcolm, are you prepared to go to the United 
          Nations at this point and ask that charges be 
          brought against the United States for its 
          treatment of the American Negroes?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Oh yes.

     The AUDIENCE applauds.
 
                    MALCOLM (contd) 
          The audience will have to be quiet. Yes, as I 
          pointed out that during my trip that nations, 
          African nations, Asian, Latin nations look very 
          hypocritical when they stand up in the UN 
          condemning South Africa and saying nothing 
          about the racist practices that are manifested 
          everyday against Negroes in this society. I 
          would be not a man if I didn't do so. I 
          wouldn't be a man.
 
                    REPORTER #3 
          Are you prepared to work with some of the 
          leaders of some of the other civil rights
           organizations?
 
                    MALCOLM
          Certainly, we will work with any groups, 
          organizations or leaders in any way, as long as 
          it's genuinely designed to get results.
 
                    REPORTER #1 
          Does the new beard have any religious 
          significance?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          No, not particularly. But I do think that you 
          will And black people in America, as they 
          strive to throw off the shackles of mental 
          colonialism, will also probably reflect an 
          effort to throw off the shackles of cultural 
          colonialism. And then they'll begin to reflect 
          desires of their own with standards of their 
          own.
 
                        REPORTER #2 
          One of your more controversial remarks was a 
          call for black people to get rifles and form 
          rifle clubs sometime back. Do you still favor 
          that for self-defense?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          I don't see why that should be controversial. I 
          think that if white people found themselves 
          victim of the same kind of brutality that black 
          people in this country face, and they saw that 
          the government was either unwilling or unable 
          to protect them, that the intelligence on the 
          part of the whites would make them get some 
          rifles and protect themselves.
 
                    REPORTER #2
          What about the guns, Malcolm?
 
                    MALCOLM 
          Has the white man changed since I went away? 
          Have you put up your guns? The day you stop 
          being violent against my people will be the 
          day I tell folks to put away their guns.

          And the fire hit the window and it woke up my 
          second oldest baby, but the fire burned on the 
          outside of the house. It could have fallen on 
          six-, four-, or two-year-old girls. And I'm 
          going to tell you, if it had done it, I'd've 
          taken my rifle and gone after anybody in sight.

                    MALCOLM 
          The way I feel, I ought not to go out there 
          today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this 
          tension by telling the black man not to fight 
          himself -- that's all a part of the white man's 
          big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst 
          ourselves, against each other. I'm not 
          fighting anyone, that's not what we're here

200B      THE STUNNED FACES OF BLACK PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE AUDUBON BALLROOM...
 
     --AND IN HARLEM.
 
     OSSIE DAVIS speaking behind the above:
 
                    OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE 
          Here at this final hour, in this quiet place, 
          Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its 
          brightest hopes, extinguished now and gone from 
          us forever.
 
200C      DOLLY SHOT of the long line of people outside the funeral parlor, 
     waiting to see Malcolm's body, where it lies before burial.
 
                    OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE: (contd) 
          For Harlem is where he worked, and where he 
          struggled and fought. His home of homes, where 
          his heart was and where his people are. And it 
          is therefore most fitting that we meet once 
          again in Harlem to share these last moments 
          with him. For Harlem has ever been gracious to 
          those who loved her, have fought for her and 
          defended her honor even to death. It is not in 
          the memory of man that this beleaguered, 
          unfortunate but nonetheless proud community has 
          found a braver, more gallant young champion 
          than this Afro-American who lies before us 
          unconquered still. Many will ask what Harlem 
          finds to honor in this stormy, controversial 
          and bold young captain and we will smile and we 
          will answer and say unto them:
 
2OOD  SHOTS - FACES OF HARLEM - PRESENT DAY - THE 90'S
 
     Ordinary PEOPLE in ordinary pursuits of life, BLACK PEOPLE still 
     struggling to stay afloat in a racist WHITE AMERICA that does not have 
     their best interests at hand -- 8 years of Reagan and now at least 4 
     years of Bush.
 
                    OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE (contd) 
          Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you 
          have him smile at you? Did you ever listen to 
          him? Did he ever really do a mean thing? Was he 
          ever associated with violence or any public 
          disturbance?

200F     SHOT - YOUNG AFRO-CENTRIC TEENAGERS WITH MALCOLM X T-SHIRTS, HATS, 
     JACKETS, JEWELRY, ETC.
 
                    OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE (contd) 
          For if you did, you would know him and if you 
          knew him, you would know why we must honor him.
 
200G     SHOT - NEWSREEL FOOTAGE OF THE _REAL_ MALCOLM X
 
                    OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE (contd) 
          Malcolm was our manhood, our living black 
          manhood. That was his meaning to his people and 
          in honoring him we honor the best in ourselves.

          And we will know him then for what he was and 
          is. A PRINCE, A BLACK SHINING PRINCE who didn't 
          hesitate to die because he loved us so.

          As Brother Malcolm said, "We declare our right 
          on this earth to be a man, to be a human being, 
          to be respected as a human being, in this 
          society, on this earth, in this day, which we 
          intend to bring into existence by any means 
          necessary."
