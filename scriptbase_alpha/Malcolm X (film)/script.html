 Fourth draft (1991)
 Screenplay by James Baldwin, Arnold Perl and Spike Lee
 Based on The Autobiography of Malcolm X as told to Alex Haley


<b>	FADE IN:
</b><b> 
</b><b>1  	EXT. ROXBURY STREET - THE WAR YEARS - DAY 
</b>
	It is a bright sunny day on a crowded street on the black side of 
	Boston. PEOPLE and KIDS are busy with their own things. 

	SHORTY bops his way down the street. He is a runty, very dark 
	young man of 21 with a mission and a smile on his face. He wears 
	the flamboyant style of the time: the whole zoot-suit, pegged legs 
	and a wide brim hat with a white feather stuck in the hat band.
<b> 
</b><b>2 	OMIT 
</b>
<b>3 	OMIT 
</b>
<b>4 	OMIT
</b><b> 
</b><b>5 	EXT. STREET - DAY 
</b>
	FOLLOW SHOT. Shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages. 
	His smile is one of anticipation. He nods to a PAL without 
	stopping; eyes a COUPLE OF CHICKS dancing on the street, but is 
	not dissuaded.
<b> 
</b><b>6	INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY 
</b>
	Shorty has his jacket and hat off, his sleeves rolled up. He is like a 
	surgeon preparing for an operation. His equipment is spread out on 
	a table: can of lye, large mason jar, wooden stirring spoon, knife, 
	the eggs. His actions have the character of a ritual: each thing 
	being done just so, in time-honored fashion.

	He slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar.
	He adds water and makes a paste of the starch.

	Behind Shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation. ONE MAN is
 	getting a haircut; TWO OTHERS are watching (TOOMER, JASON)
	one of them from behind a newspaper. A middle-aged barber, 
	CHOLLY, is doing most of the talking.
<b> 
</b><b>				CHOLLY 
</b>		After I hit the number that woman wasn't no good 
		to me at all.
<b> 
</b>	The men laugh.
<b> 
</b>	ANGLE - Shorty pries open the can of lye, whiffs it. It's good and 
	strong. He pours some in the mason jar, stirring with the wooden 
	spoon. He cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs. He waits as 
	fumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot.
<b> 
</b>	ANOTHER ANGLE - The barbershop SEEN from a door, slightly 
	ajar. A woolly head, entirely in shadow, peers out. 

<b>				CHOLLY'S VOICE 
</b>		She says I'm cheap cuz I won't cop her a diamond 
		ring. Had the indignation to call me a cheap 
		black sunovabitch to boot.

<b>				TOOMER 
</b>		And when a black woman call you a cheap black 
		sunovabitch you've been called a cheap black 
		sunovabitch.
<b> 
</b>	Cholly is annoyed. It's _his_ story. 

<b>				CHOLLY 
</b>		Will you let me tell it?

	ON SHORTY - He opens the bulky package he has been carrying, 
	unfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it. Now he dons a pair of
 	rubber gloves.

<b>				SHORTY 
</b>		Where's Homeboy?

	He is all ready; one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of 
	Vaseline. His manner is indignant as if he were asking the whereabouts 
	of an exasperating child.
<b> 
</b><b>				CHOLLY 
</b>		Red's in the head, man.
<b> 
</b><b>				TOOMER 
</b>		You mean hiding in the head.
<b> 
</b><b>				CHOLLY 
</b>		Hey, Red. Your man's here and waiting on you. 

	His hands full, Cholly opens the door with his feet and MALCOLM comes 
	out, a big, gawky, bright-faced country boy, wearing downhome clothes 
	and an expression of apprehension.
<b> 
</b><b>				TOOMER 
</b>		Gonna get that first conk laid on, hunh, 
		Homeboy?
<b> 
</b><b>				CHOLLY 
</b>		Man, don't scare him more than he's scared 
		already. Ain't too bad...
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair, where Cholly drapes 
	him with a double sheet, tucking it tightly around his neck and adding 
	a protective collar of paper.
<b> 
</b><b>				CHOLLY
</b>	...Like anything else. First time a chick gets her 
	cherry popped, she might put up a little fight. But 
	pretty soon you can't give her enough. Right, 
	Homeboy?
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM 
</b>
	Malcolm gulps, his eyes on the fuming mason jar. 

	Shorty starts massaging a great quantity of Vaseline into Malcolm's 
	scalp, covering his neck and ears as well. All the men have gathered
 	around, involved in the ritual. For Malcolm it is closer to being a 
	kind of execution.
<b> 
</b><b>				CHOLLY 
</b>		Git his forehead and eyebrows.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		I know what I'm doing.
<b> 
</b>	Shorty applies the Vaseline to that area.  Now he brings over the
	steaming jar and places it nearby.

				SHORTY (contd)
 		Listen. You pull my coat if it's still stinging 
		when I get through 'cause this shit can burn a 
		hole through cement.
<b> 
</b><b>				CHOLLY 
</b>		Hold tight, baby, and keep your eyes shut.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm nods his head, clenches his eyes and grits his teeth. Shorty 
	applies the congolene with a comb, working it into Malcolm's hair.

<b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM 
</b>
<b>				MALCOLM
</b>		I thought you said it was gonna sting... this 
		ain't nothin'.
<b> 
</b>	For a moment nothing happens, then the heat hits him. He yells, tries 
	to catch his breath: his head is on fire.
<b> 
</b>                    MALCOLM (contd)
		You motherfucker.  You're killing me. I'm 
		burning up. My damn head is on fire.

	He nearly leaps out of the chair, but the barber restrains him.

	Shorty, utterly unmoved by the outburst, continues working the 
	congolene into his hair. 

	Malcolm breaks out of the chair wildly. But the three men drag him to a 
	basin where Shorty has attached the shower spray. His cries filling the 
	room, Malcolm is ducked under the spray. Shorty starts rinsing out his 
	hair.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		Don't fight me, man. Let me git it out.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm is a little relieved, he tentatively opens his eyes, then he 
	feels the congolene again and there is another outburst. Shorty forces 
	his head under the spray, spurts the water all over his head, wetting 
	Malcolm and the shop in the process.
<b> 
</b><b>7	OMIT 
</b>
<b>8 	OMIT
</b><b> 
</b><b>9  	INT. CLOTHING STORE - DAY
</b><b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		Well, Homeboy, you almost there. Turn around.
<b> 
</b>	Shorty is supervising as Malcolm tries on a zoot suit. He slips into 
	the jacket...
<b> 
</b>	Shoes-off, Malcolm steps into the tight-fltting peg-legged pants ......
 	dons a wide-brimmed hat with a bright blue feather.... Finally, fully 
	outfitted, he leans forward toward his new image in the full-length 
	mirror, twirling a long, dangling key chain.
<b> 
</b><b>     				SHORTY 
</b>		Well, all right, then.
<b> 
</b><b>   				MALCOLM 
</b>		Well, all reet, then.
<b> 
</b>	The transformation is complete. The two laugh and slap hands. 

<b>10	EXT. ROXBURY STREET - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>	Malcolm and Shorty come strutting down the street: two conked,
	zoot-suited sharpies. Hometown boy has departed. And the CHICKS on the 
	street notice them, especially Malcolm, the taller of the two, the 
	lighter-skinned, the more dominant. They walk imperiously past, fully 
	aware of their impact.
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>	FREEZE FRAME. He becomes a STILL.
<b> 
</b><b>				VOICE OF MALCOLM X 
</b>		When my mother was pregnant with me, she told 
		me later, a party of Klansmen on horseback 
		surrounded our house in Omaha.

10A 	ANGLE. KLAN on horses in front of house.
<b> 
</b>				VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
		They brandished guns and shouted for my father 
		to come out. My mother went to the door where 
		they could see her pregnant condition... 

	ANGLE. A pregnant Louise Little on porch.
<b> 
</b>				VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
		...and told them my father was in Milwaukee, 
		preaching. 

	ANGLE. The Klan breaks all the windows in the house then rides off into 
	the glorious D.W. Griffith _Birth of a Nation_ moonlit night. 

<b>	CLOSE - LOUISE LITTLE
</b><b> 
</b>				VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
		The hooded Klansman said the good, white 
		Christians would not stand for his 
		troublemaking, and to get out of town.
<b> 
</b>	ANGLE. The terrified Little children look out a broken window at their 
	mother.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE. AN OLD FRAME HOUSE IN OMAHA
</b><b> 
</b>				VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
		They broke every window with their rifle butts 
		before riding off into the night, their torches 
		flaming.

<b>	ANGLE. FRONT PORCH OF THE LITTLE HOUSE - AN EMPTY ROCKER ON IT
</b><b> 
</b>				VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd)
 		My father was not a frightened Negro as most 
		were then and as many still are today. He was 
		six feet four and very black...
<b> 
</b><b>10B 	CLOSE - EARL LITTLE
</b>
	He looks directly into the camera, wearing a Baptist Minister's robe.
<b> 
</b> 				VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
		...and had a glass eye. He believed, as did 
		Marcus Garvey, that freedom, independence and 
		self-respect could never be achieved by the 
		Negro in America . . .
<b>  
</b><b>10C 	CLOSE - EARL LITTLE
</b><b> 
</b>	He wears a Garvey hat, ornate with gold braid.
<b> 
</b>				VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
		...that, therefore, black men should leave 
		America and return to the land of their origin.
<b> 
</b>10D 	ANGLE. Earl Little, in a wagon with little Malcolm.
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - EARL LITTLE:
</b><b> 
</b>				VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
		My father dedicated his life to his beliefs 
		because he had seen four of his six brothers 
		die violently...
<b> 
</b>10E 	WIDER ANGLE. WE SEE Earl in front of a podium in church. He is
	preaching.
<b> 
</b>				VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
		...three killed by white men and one lynched. 
		There are nine children in our family.
<b> 
</b>	ANGLE. The nine Little children. 

<b>	CLOSE - LOUISE LITTLE 
</b>
	She is a pretty, mature woman and white-looking.
<b> 
</b>				VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
		My mother was an attractive woman, an educated 
		woman, a strong woman.
<b> 
</b><b>10F CLOSE - LOUISE AND EARL
</b><b> 
</b>	A posed wedding picture, serious but sweet.
<b> 
</b>				VOICE OF MALCOLM X (contd) 
		She was very light, her mama was raped by a 
		white man. One of the reasons she married my 
		father was because he was so black, she 
		disliked her complexion and wanted her children 
		to have some color.
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE SHOT

</b>
<b>15 	INT. ROSELAND STATE BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM AND SHORTY
</b><b> 
</b>	They both were posed for a picture. The music "FLYING HOME" is blaring 
	as LIONEL HAMPTON and his band is killing. The music is WILD, the
 	dancing is frantic, the clothes are OUT, and the crowd is predominately 
	BLACK, although there is a peppering of WHITES, especially white chicks.
 	And Malcolm is a little bug-eyed as he nudges Shorty, watching mixed 
	couples on the floor. 

	A BOY in extreme zoot-suit flips him; a WHITE GIRL in long blond
	hair wigs him. Malcolm is a little open-mouthed.
<b> 
</b><b>				A VOICE 
</b><b>		SHOWTIME, SHOWTIME!
</b><b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - THE BALLROOM - NIGHT 
</b>
	People start moving off the floor, making room for the dancers. The 
	music begins to get faster and more furious. 

<b>	CLOSE - HAMPTON'S BAND - NIGHT 
</b>
	It is a fast Lindy. People start clapping to the beat as they form a U 
	around the DANCERS, with the band at the open end.
<b> 
</b><b>16 	INT. THE DANCE FLOOR
</b><b> 
</b>	TWO COUPLES are on the floor, dancing wildly. They are quickly joined 
	by a half dozen OTHERS. These are the best dancers and constitute the 
	main event of a Saturday night black dance. People crowd and push to 
	get better vantage points and the competition is under way.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE ON THE CROWD 
</b>
	It is dominantly black, but there are some whites in the audience, 
	mostly women. One is SOPHIA, a spectacular blonde with a degree of
 	refinement, something of a thrill-seeker. Many of the men try to catch 
	her eye, but for the moment Sophia is just watching, looking for no one 
	in particular, but nonetheless looking.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE: - COUPLE ON THE DANCE FLOOR
</b><b> 
</b>	Getting ready to enter the fray, the GIRL takes off her shoes and 
	bounces out on the floor barefoot with her partner. Their advent is 
	greeted with cheers and ad libs. Clearly the crowd has its favorites. 

<b>	WIDER SHOT
</b>
	The music gets faster and the dancing takes on a more frantic and more 
	remarkable quality. 

<b>	FOLLOW SHOT - MALCOLM 
</b>
	He is looking for his partner, the girl he brought and now he sees her. 
	He makes his way through the watching audience. 

<b>	CLOSE - LAURA 
</b>
	She is a fine chick, cool and beautiful. She smiles as she sees Malcolm 
	approaching.

	TWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm stand together, delighted to be with one 
	another, starting to move to the music, as they watch the dancers.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Come on, baby, let's show 'em how.
<b> 
</b>	Laura smiles shyly; she's willing.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		You better get out of them shoes, girl.
<b> 
</b>	Laura laughs, goes quickly to a bench and changes into a pair of 
	sneakers.
<b> 
</b><b>17 	INT. THE DANCE FLOOR
</b><b> 
</b>	Because of the competition, Laura and Malcolm begin at high speed. In a 
	moment they are executing the most intricate steps of the "flapping 
	eagle" and the "kangaroo." Malcolm starts boosting her over and around 
	his hips, then boosting her over his shoulders. Laura is the perfect 
	partner. She loves it.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE WITH THE CROWD
</b><b> 
</b>	So does the crowd, who loves new stars. There are ad lib remarks: "Go,
 	man, go." "Hey, Red." "Mmmmmm ummm."
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE: - SHORTY
</b><b> 
</b>	A big, fat, hefty BLACK WOMAN takes Shorty out to the dance floor, and 
	she takes the lead. As they do the Lindy she is slinging Shorty around 
	like a rag doll. This woman slides him through her legs and Shorty has 
	had enough, he runs off the dance floor, and hides.
<b> 
</b>	TWO-SHOT. Laura and Malcolm are, in the phrase, cooking on all burners 
	now; and when they execute an especially intricate step, even Hamp 
	waves over.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm is sweating and flushed and enormously elated. He sees that 
	people are watching him, goading him on. He notices that Sophia, in 
	particular, has not taken her eyes off him; she is clapping in time to 
	his steps.
<b> 
</b>	Seeing new stars in the making, the other dancers move to the side of 
	the floor, marking time, yielding the dance floor to them. Laura and 
	Malcolm go into a solo.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLES
</b><b> 
</b>	The crowd loves it. Malcolm and Sophia are very aware of each other. 
	The finale is the classic drag, with Laura hanging limp around 
	Malcolm's neck as he capers off the dance floor to the spontaneous 
	applause of the audience. 

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - SOPHIA (SLO-MO) 
</b>
	Clapping enthusiastically -- in open admiration. 

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - SHORTY
</b><b> 
</b>	Waiting to catch them as they come off. Shorty is whistling and shaking 
	his hand appreciatively. He is also looking out for his dance partner.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		Hey, man, gimme some skin.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Shorty, this is Laura.
<b> 
</b>Laura is flushed and out of breath and joyous.
<b> 
</b><b>				LAURA
</b>		'Lo. I've got to freshen up.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Now you come back.
<b>  
</b>	Laura laughs as she goes. She surely will be back.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		That's a fine chick.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Fine as May wine.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
<b> 
</b>	Then his vision catches Sophia, who is approaching him. She makes a 
	simple, direct gesture, "Want to dance?" Malcolm eyes Shorty and 
	wordlessly glides into Sophia's arms.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR
</b><b> 
</b>	Immediately from the glances of the other men at the dance, he is the 
	cynosure of all eyes. He has new status. It's a heady feeling because 
	she is the first white girl he has ever been with socially who is not 
	an obvious whore. He begins to show off a little, cuts a few fine 
	steps.
<b> 
</b>	TWO-SHOT. They are dancing closer than before. Sophia begins to rock 
	his black world. 

<b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM 
</b>
	Trying to play it cool -- but he is beginning to pant. Not from the 
	dancing, but from the situation: a gorgeous white chick asking for
 	it.
<b> 
</b><b>				SOPHIA 
</b>		Why don't you take your little girl home, Red, 
		and come on back?
<b> 
</b>	He stops in his tracks. He can't believe it.
<b> 
</b>				SOPHIA (contd) 
		Just walk. Don't run. It'll be here when you 
		get back. 

	He can only grin.

<b>18	EXT. LAURA'S HOUSE - ROXBURY - NIGHT 
</b>
	The porch of a respectable house. Malcolm with Laura; he anxious to get 
	away.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I better not come in.
<b>  
</b><b>				LAURA
</b>		I ain't stupid.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I mean it's late, baby.
<b> 
</b><b>				LAURA
</b>		I know where you're going.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I'm going to bed. I gotta work tomorrow, need 
		my rest.
<b> 
</b>	Laura walks to the door.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.
<b> 
</b><b>				LAURA
</b>		What for? I ain't white and I don't put out. 

	The front door opens, it's Laura's grandmother, MRS. JOHNSON.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		'Night, Mrs. Johnson.
<b> 
</b>	He runs down the porch steps.
<b> 
</b><b>19	INT. SOPHIA'S CAR - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>	The lone light emits from the car radio which plays The Inkspots' "IF I
<b> 	DIDN'T CARE."
</b><b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - SOPHIA
</b><b> 
</b>	Sophia pulls her tight sweater over her head to expose two full ripe 
	white breasts. Malcolm's eyes are popping out of his head. NOTE: It's 
	very unusual for women not to wear a bra back in that day but you might 
	say Sophia was way ahead of her time.
<b> 
</b><b>				SOPHIA
</b>		Malcolm, look at them. Have you ever seen white 
		breasts like these?
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>	He shakes his head.
<b> 
</b>				SOPHIA (contd) 
		Put your black hands on them.
<b> 
</b>	He is paralyzed.

				SOPHIA (contd) 
		Please do as I say.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm mumbles something. He then kisses Sophia as if his black life 
	depended on it and he commences to kill it.
<b> 
</b>				SOPHIA (contd) 
		Hey, baby.
<b> 
</b> 	She stops him for a moment, but he buries his head in her long neck.
<b> 
</b>				SOPHIA (contd) 
		Am I the first white woman you've been with? 

	She already knows the answer. He laughs.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Sheeet, you ain't. I had aplenty.
<b> 
</b><b>				SOPHIA
</b>		...That isn't a whore?

	Knowing she's right, Sophia becomes the aggressor. 

	A beat -- both panting -- then Malcolm stops abruptly. He raises his 
	hand to his face, then to Sophia's hand which is still caressing him.
<b> 
</b><b>				SOPHIA
</b>		That's alright. Baby, take your time. Sophia's 
		not going anywhere. I told you to walk, don't 
		run.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Shhhh! I don't like women that talk.
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - SOPHIA
</b>
	She shrugs, then moves to embrace him.
<b> 
</b><b>				SOPHIA 
</b>		Who wants to talk? 

	The couple starts at it again. 

<b>19A	INT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>	On the screen, Bogart and Cagney are blasting away the dirty, flat-
	footed coppers with machine guns. It's one of those great Warner 
	Brothers gangster B movies, maybe _The Roaring Twenties_.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - MALCOLM AND SHORTY
</b><b>  
</b>	Malcolm and Shorty sit, transfixed in their seats.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		Eat lead, coppers.
<b> 
</b><b>80 	EXT. BOSTON COMMONS - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>	A bright, sunny day, long shadows in the park. The Commons is almost 
	empty. Two improbable zoot-suited blacks race past trees, and run over 
	the grass. Malcolm and Shorty are playing Cops and Robbers while 
	PASSERSBY stare.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		Bang, bang. You're dead.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for 
		size. 

	Malcolm fires an imaginary tommy machine gun at Shorty.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof 
		vest.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		The hell you are.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		I'm tired of always playing the cops. I wanna 
		be Bogart sometimes.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		You're too small to be Bogart.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		I'm not too short to be Cagney.
<b> 
</b>	Shorty shoots Malcolm from behind.
<b> 
</b>				SHORTY (contd) 
		Pow. Take that.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm acts as if he's been hit.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Ahhh! You got me, you dirty, filthy, rotten, 
		stinking copper, only a low-down yellow rat 
		bastard would shoot a man in the back.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm starts to stagger, this is a long drawn out Hollywood drawn-out 
	death a la Cagney death in _Public Enemy_. 

<b>	LOW ANGLE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>	Malcolm falls directly into the camera, face first, and Shorty stands 
	over him.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		He use to be a big shot.

	closer and closer to the black man lying on the tracks.
<b> 
</b><b>27 	INT. A HEARING ROOM - DAY

	and an ashtray full of butts are on the night table: last night's 
	partying.
<b> 
</b><b>				SOPHIA
</b>		You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		C'mere.
<b> 
</b>	WIDEN TO SHOW SOPHIA at the stove fixing eggs. She wears an apron and 
	nothing else. It's a nicely furnished middle-class apartment.
<b> 
</b><b>				SOPHIA 
</b>		Sweetie, they're almost ready.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		You hear me, girl?

	She shrugs, shuts off the burner, smiles and ambles toward him. 

<b>				SOPHIA 
</b>		You the man. 

<b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		You better believe it. 

	She starts to sit down on the bed next to him. 

				MALCOLM (contd) 
		Sit over there.

	He points to a nearby chair. Sophia makes an amiable hand-shrug and 
	complacently goes.

<b>				SOPHIA 
</b>		You evil this morning. 

<b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		What's your story, baby?
<b> 
</b>	He doesn't want to hear her; he wants to talk. He goes right on: 

				MALCOLM (contd) 
		You one of them white bitches can't get enough 
		black dick. Is that what you are?

	Sophia smiles. She aims to please. Malcolm smacks the bed next to him. 
	She gets up and comes over.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		Take it off.
<b> 
</b>	She takes off the apron.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		Now kiss my feet. Kiss 'em!

	As Sophia bends to do so.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Feed me.
<b> 
</b>	ANGLE. Sophia now has the scrambled eggs on a plate at Malcolm's side. 
	She spoons some into his mouth. He chews and swallows slowly, then 
	grabs her head and brings it to his. A long, brutal kiss. Then he pulls 
	her head away by the hair. She looks at him: anything he wants.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna 
		holler "rape," sister?

</b><b>				SOPHIA
</b>		Me?

</b>		Sure wish your mama and papa could see you now. 
		And that ofay you gonna marry. 

<b>30	EXT. A BEACH - BRIGHT SUNLIGHT - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>	Malcolm and Laura are on a deserted Cape beach. They are dressed but 
	have their shoes and socks off, and he has his trousers rolled up. They 
	walk, like birds, avoiding getting their feet wet as the waves roll in.
<b> 
</b><b>				LAURA
</b>		Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got

<b> 
</b><b> 				MALCOLM 
</b>		All them books you read and you still don't

	they both drop into the sand.

	station.
<b> 
</b><b>47	EXT. 125TH STREET STATION - P.M.
</b><b> 
</b>	Malcolm, out of uniform and dressed in his zoot suit, comes down from 
	the Park Avenue station in Harlem. He is hit with the sights and sounds. 
	Everything delights him: the noise, the lights, the women, the pimps, 
	the signs, the windows, the crowds, the laughter, the music.

	A CROWD OF PEOPLE run by Malcolm yelling and screaming.
<b>

</b>		The Brown Bomber, The Brown Bomber, Joe Louis, 
		the heavyweight champion of the world. Joe got

<b>  
</b><b>50A	CLOSE - MALCOLM
</b>
	He runs after them.

<b>50B 	EXT. 125TH AND LENOX AVENUE
</b><b> 
</b>	All traffic has stopped, there is a huge spontaneous celebration going 
	on. Black folks are everywhere, it seems as if all of Harlem is out on 
	the streets. The citizens of Harlem are hugging, kissing, drinking, 
	dancing, folks are hanging from street lamps, yelling out their 
	windows, holding up hand-made JOE LOUIS banners, everyone has great 
	reason to be joyous. The heavyweight champion of the world is a BLACK 
	MAN -- JOE LOUIS, THE BROWN BOMBER, he has regained his championship.
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE: - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>	Malcolm quickly looks at his watch, he's running late for his train, as 
	he fights his way through the crowd like a salmon going upstream, the 
	CAMERA CRANES up to see him eventually get lost in a sea of BLACK 
	HUMANITY "cutting loose." 

<b>								FADE OUT.

</b><b>FADE IN:
</b><b> 
</b><b>57	EXT. SEVENTH AVENUE - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>	Malcolm, newly conked and sharp as a tack (zoot suit, trouser crease 
	like a knife's edge, orange knob-toed shoes) walks toward his goal: 
	Small's Paradise.
<b> 
</b>	The street is crowded with PEOPLE, KIDS and HUSTLERS.
<b> 
</b><b>				YOUNG HOOKER 
</b>		Slow down, daddy, what's your hurry? Lemme show 
		you somepin brand new.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm smiles "No thanks" keeps moving.
<b> 
</b><b>				HUSTLER 
</b>		Hey, man, hundred-dollar ring -- diamond; and a 
		ninety dollar watch. Take the both of them for 
		a quarter; twenty-five bucks.

 	Malcolm waves; he's not having any. Goes on.

<b>58	EXT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>	Before entering, Malcolm sharps himself a bit, picking off some lint,
	cocking his hat. And enters.

<b>59	INT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>	The restaurant is crowded, both at the bar and at the tables beyond.
	The immediate impression is of subdued well-being, of decorum, of easy 
	affluence. This is the world Malcolm wants into. He digs it, drinking 
	in its details.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - BAR
</b>
	A big man, FOX, accidentally bumps into Malcolm almost knocking over.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		The word is excuse me.
<b> 
</b><b>				FOX 
</b>		Look, country boy, you shouldn't have been in 
		my way.
<b> 
</b>	Everyone becomes quiet in the bar.
<b> 
</b>				FOX (contd) 
		So what are you gonna do? Go run home to your 
		Mama.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm grabs a bottle off the bar counter and with lightning speed
	brings it crashing down on Fox's head. As he lays on the floor with 
	head bleeding, Malcolm kicks him in the stomach _two times_. It's done,
 	the fight is over and people pull him off of Fox.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Don't ever again in life step on my Florsheims 
		again, and never talk-bout my mother.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE WITH MALCOLM AND THE BARTENDER
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Gimme a whiskey.
<b> 
</b>	BARTENDER pours him a double.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I ordered a single, Jack.
<b> 
</b><b>				BARTENDER
</b>		The double's on that gentleman. Jack!
<b> 
</b>	He points.

<b>	ARCHIE AT THE TABLE - FROM MALCOLM'S POV
</b><b>  
</b>	The elderly man nods. He is big, he is very black. The same color as 
	Malcolm's father. 

<b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>	He raises his glass, toasts Archie and downs it. Then leaning into the 
	bar, asks:
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Who is he, man?
<b> 
</b><b>				BARTENDER
</b>		That's West Indian Archie.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Whut's he do?
<b> 
</b>	The bartender would not normally answer this, but Malcolm is the man of 
	the moment, so the bartender speaks:
<b> 
</b><b>				BARTENDER
</b>		This and that.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm nods, then looks over again at Archie -- in appreciation. 
	Archie wiggles a finger for him to come over.
<b> 
</b><b>59A 	AT ARCHIE'S TABLE
</b><b> 
</b>	Malcolm is standing.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look 
		brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		He had it coming.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm sits. There are no introductions. He just nods at SAMMY and 
<b>	CADILLAC.
</b><b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		What they call you?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Red, and I ain't no punk.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down 
		in this town, you better stand up or make 
		tracks.
<b> 
</b><b>				SAMMY
</b>		Man live by his rep.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		That's a fact. What you do, boy?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I'm working trains. Selling.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE
</b>		Bet you like that shit.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Keeps me out of the army.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		When they want your ass, won't nothing keep you 
		out.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I 
		got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a 
		good man to know.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		Heard where?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Where I come from. Boston.
<b> 
</b>	Sammy and Cadillac are watching a little skeptically. Archie is 
	flattered.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Man's rep travels.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		How 'bout that?
<b> 
</b>	Then seeing Sammy and Cadillac's dubious visages, Archie adds:
<b> 
</b>				ARCHIE (contd) 
		You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		My papa taught me one thing: don't never 
		bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.

	Archie laughs. Even Sammy smiles. Cadillac still holds his judgment.
<b>  
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		Is your papa West Indian?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		I like you, country.
<b> 
</b><b>				SAMMY
</b>		Only where'd you get them goddam vines.
<b> 
</b><b>				CADILLAC 
</b>		And them shoes. Oh, my.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		Yeah, got to do something about you.
<b> 
</b><b>				SAMMY
</b>		You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
<b> 
</b>	Sammy covers his eyes. Malcolm plays off the insults.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Where can I get a hold of you?
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Lemme write it down for you.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm reaches for a pencil.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		Don't never write nothing down. File it up 
		here, like I do.
			(touching his head) 
		'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't 
		got no proof. Ya dig?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Yes, sir.
<b> 
</b>	Archie looks at him sharply.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		Boy, look me in the face.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm does so.

				ARCHIE (contd) 
		Did you just now con me?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Yes, sir.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		Why?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		'Cause I want in. And it don't take a lot to 
		know you there, daddy.

	Archie and Sammy laugh at his directness. Cadillac smiles. Archie 
	pushes back his chair, about to get up. 

<b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		I got me a little run to make.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm has suddenly been excluded and he wants desperately back in.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Can I run with you, Mr. Archie?
<b> 
</b>	Archie eyes him, weighing him seriously.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		I like your heart and I like your style. You 
		might just do, Little. Lessen you got to git 
		back to that train job.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I done told the man what he could do with his 
		train.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		When?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Just now.
<b> 
</b>	The three established hustlers smile at the newcomer in their midst.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		Come on, baby. We going shopping...

</b><b> 
</b>	Malcolm is looking at himself in a mirror in Archie's room. He has on 
	the full outfit now, together with a new white on white shirt and a 
	Sulka tie. Looks great.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE
</b>		Just the middle button, baby. Just the middle 
		one.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm buttons the jacket and turns around, demonstrating for Archie's 
	inspection.
<b> 
</b>				ARCHIE (contd) 
		You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as 
		the Board of Health. But you missing something.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		What?
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		Frisk me, baby. Give me a real pat down.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm doesn't understand, but he senses something -- and becomes 
	excited. Archie has walked over to him.
<b> 
</b>				ARCHIE (contd) 
		Go ahead. Do me.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm frisks him carefully: pats his sides, his pockets, under his 
	arms, his legs. Archie is clean to the touch.
<b> 
</b>				ARCHIE (contd) 
			(triumphantly) 
		And I'm still carrying.

	He smacks the small of his back. Then, reaching under his coat, he 
	takes a revolver out from the middle of his back. And hands it to 
	Malcolm.
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>	Holding the deadly instrument, fascinated by it, hefting it, feeling 
	its power.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		It's yours, baby. Put it on.

	Malcolm slips it carefully into the small of his back, behind his 
	trouser belt. His first gun: the feeling shines in his eyes, Bogart has 
	become a black man.

				ARCHIE (contd) 
		How's it feel?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Solid, daddy.
<b>

	to Malcolm and hands him a short straw. Sophia sits next to Malcolm; 
	she and Archie are already high. Malcolm leans over the mirror, placing 
	the straw in his nostril.
<b> 
</b><b>	TIGHT CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM'S FACE

<b>75	EXT. SMALL'S PARADISE - NIGHT 
</b>
	A miserable night, raining and cold. Malcolm turns into the bar.
<b> 
</b><b>76 	INT. THE BAR - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>	Shaking off the rain as Malcolm walks through. He is now a familiar 
	figure to the bar's DENIZENS. He is met with ad lib cries: "Hey, 
	Little," "Have a taste," from the men; and from the women: "Come here, 
	sugar," "Where you been?"
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm acknowledges the greetings, strolls down in the bar. It's 
	immediately clear that a subtle change has come over him. He is no 
	longer the neophyte but a well-groomed, smooth, fully polished hustler.

<b>	ANGLE - BOOTH 
</b>
	Malcolm sits into the booth and motions for the waitress.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - HONEY
</b><b> 
</b>	A fine copper tan waitress comes to him.
<b> 
</b><b>				HONEY
</b>		I thought you said we were going to the movies 
		last night.
<b>

</b>		I say a lot of things.
<b> 
</b><b>				HONEY
</b>		And like a fool I believe it.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and 
		a pack of Lucky's.
<b> 
</b>	Honey stares at him.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		I said now.
<b> 
</b>	She leaves. He leans his head back against the booth --
<b> 
</b><b>				A FEMALE VOICE 
</b>		Daniel come in yet, Honey?
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm turns his head sharply at the sound of the voice. It's 
	familiar, a sound from the seemingly distant past. He looks toward the 
	bar and sees the women who asked the question.
<b> 
</b><b>	LAURA - MALCOLM'S POV
</b><b> 
</b>	It's Laura, but not the Laura we last saw. She is still young, still 
	vulnerable, but she is bolder, more self-assured, more vividly dressed.
	She is unaware of Malcolm.
<b> 
</b><b>				HONEY
</b>		Ain't that him now?
<b> 
</b>	ANGLE FAVORING DANIEL. He is a young, cocky, nervous, gingerbread 
	colored boy who comes over to her quickly. He goes to the corner of the 
	bar and quickly grabs Laura's neck and kisses her hungrily.
<b> 
</b><b>				DANIEL 
</b>		Hey, gorgeous, how you been? Waiting long? 
		Lemme see you. Wow!

	It's obvious he's a junkie. And in need of a fix. QUICK!
<b> 
</b><b>	SHOT - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>	Honey places his drink and cigarettes before him. He's watching, taking 
	it all in immediately. Laura is clearly crazy about Daniel. 

<b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>	He looks, then belts down his drink. 

<b>	CLOSER - LAURA AND DANIEL 
</b>
	Daniel motions to her pocketbook and she takes out a five-dollar bill. 
	He grabs it, and bolts for the door. 

<b>	WITH MALCOLM AND HONEY 
</b>
	She has been watching Malcolm.
<b> 
</b><b>				HONEY
</b>		You know that gal?

<b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Mind your own goddamn business ... She comes in 
		a lot?
<b> 
</b><b>				HONEY
</b>		'Bout every other night, Red.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		With him?

	Honey nods.
<b>  
</b> 				MALCOLM (contd) 
		She know?
<b> 
</b><b>				HONEY
</b>		If she got eyes, she do.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - LAURA
</b>
	Walking toward the door, looking for Daniel. She leaves the bar. 

<b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM AND HONEY
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Is she hooking?
<b> 
</b><b>				HONEY
</b>		Not yet. But the way things going, that boy 
		gonna turn her out any day.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm smacks the table in frustration.
<b> 
</b>				HONEY (contd) 
		You stuck on her?
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - GLASS
</b>
	Malcolm's glass on the table is trembling. 

<b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Shut up, bitch.

	He raises his arm to hit her and it is held back before it can find its
	mark.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		Don't do that.
<b> 
</b>	Archie is standing above him. Malcolm nods, and Archie lets his arm go; 
	standing next to him is Sophia.
<b> 
</b>				ARCHIE (contd) 
		Honey, he didn't mean it.

	Archie wiggles his fingers and Honey goes, but not before throwing 
	daggers at Malcolm and Sophia. Archie sits down, takes out a cigar. For 
	a good beat there is a coolness between them. Then Malcolm reaches over 
	and lights Archie's cigar. Sophia stares at her man, he then motions 
	for her to sit down beside him.
<b> 
</b>				ARCHIE (contd) 
		Thanks. You got it. Who's beating on you, Red? 
		You looking a little up tight.

	The father-son thing is back, but Malcolm will never again be the 
	student.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Daddy, where's my money?
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		What you talking?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		You owe me six big ones.

</b>	Archie looks at him, non-comprehending.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Was you that high? Old man, I threw the slats at

<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		You never had it.

</b>	Archie doesn't even look at Sophia.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		Shit, what else she gonna say?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You 
		done slipped.
<b> 
</b>	Archie is controlling himself. Everyone in Small's is all ears, a
 	falling out between Malcolm and Archie -- their reps are at stake.
<b> 
</b>	ANGLE. Archie looks at Sammy. Sammy is neutral. Archie digs in his 
	pockets, comes up with a roll. He peels off six $100 bills and throws 
	them on the table in front of himself, as he gets up.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Oh, sit down, man. What you tasting? I'm buying.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE
</b>		I ain't drinking hot piss with you. Come on, Sam.
<b> 
</b><b>				SAMMY
</b>		Be right there.

		Twenty-two years he didn't never forget no

<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Got to be a first time, daddy-o.
<b>

</b><b> 
</b>	Malcolm comes running out of an alleyway and onto the street. He stops 
	to catch his breath, to regain his composure. He is shook up,

	Earl starts to put on his overalls and reaches for his gun which sits

<b> 
</b>	Malcolm has withdrawn within himself. He takes out a packet of cocaine 
	and sniffs it.
<b> 
</b><b>				SOPHIA 
</b>		We'll take it easy. I got a place fixed up on

<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this. 

	Shorty eyes him with amazement. The degree of Malcolm's depravity 
	surprises even him.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Surprise you, baby? Well, that's the way it is. 
		What kind of scratch you got on you? Turn out. 
		Let me have it. All of you--

		a bath on Friday.
<b> 
</b>	Peg and Sophia are listening, a little horrified.
<b> 
</b>				RUDY (contd) 
		Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on 
		him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		So what about him?
<b> 
</b><b>				RUDY
</b>		So? The man got silver, china, rugs--
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Might be all right.

</b>		Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my

</b><b>				RUDY
</b>		I'm the man.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
<b> 
</b>	He takes out his gun, a .38 revolver. He dumps the shells on the table, 
	then reinserts one shell and twirls the barrel.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		I'll flip first.
<b> 
</b>	He puts the revolver to his own head.
<b> 
</b><b>				PEG

<b> 
</b>	Malcolm squeezes the trigger. It clicks. Now he twirls the barrel again 
	and hands the gun to Rudy.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Your flip, baby.

	Rudy is staring at him; so are they all. Malcolm puts the gun to his 
	temple again.
<b> 
</b><b>				SOPHIA 
</b>		Red, for God's sake-- 

	He pulls the trigger a second time. Click. Now he twirls it again.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		Christ, Red, no--

<b>				PEG 
</b>		I can't stand it. 

	Malcolm puts the gun to Rudy's head.
<b>

</b>		Jesus Christ, no. Okay, okay. You got it, you

	A beat.

</b>		Don't never try to cross someone who ain't 
		afraid to die.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		You the man!
<b> 
</b>	Nodding accord from Rudy and Shorty. Sophia can hardly stand.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		All right. We'll start with Old Talcum Powder. 
		You draw the house, where everything is. You 
		and Peg go out and buy them tools like I told 
		you. We hit tonight on account of in the

<b> 
</b>	Rudy is at a table drawing a diagram; the girls have left. Shorty and 
	Malcolm alone at a window.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		What did you do, Homey, palm it?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM
</b>		Yeah.

	He breaks open the gun -- the bullet is in the next slot to be fired. 

				MALCOLM (contd) 
		Palmed it right in the goddam chamber. 

<b>				SHORTY 
</b>		Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts. 

	Malcolm starts laughing: a silent, hysterical laugh.

</b><b> 
</b><b>FADE IN:
</b><b> 
</b><b>102	INT. THE CELL CORRIDOR - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>	It is the afternoon lockup: about 3:30 P.M. The line of PRISONERS 
	stands in front of their cells, as two guards, WILKINS and BARNES, one 
	white, one black, slowly walk past the P.M. check. 

	The procedure is routine, done without emotion, as it is done three 
	times a day: the black guard calls out the prisoner's name, the 
	prisoner answers with his number, then steps into his cell. Whereupon 
	the white guard slams the door shut and locks it.
<b> 
</b><b>				GUARD WILKINS 
</b>		Jackson.
<b> 
</b><b>				PRISONER 
</b><b>		A 231549.
</b><b> 
</b>	Door is slammed and gate locked. 

<b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM 
</b>
	Each time a gate is locked his tension increases. His face is a mask 
	hiding his fury, violence and the hunger of an advanced junkie who has 
	not had a fix in over a week.
<b> 
</b><b>				GUARD WILKINS 
</b>		Crichlow.
<b> 
</b><b>				SECOND PRISONER
</b><b>		A 5991301.
</b><b> 
</b>	Same procedure.
<b> 
</b>	ANGLE. SHOOTING PAST MALCOLM, FAVORING TWO OTHER PRISONERS. The guards 
	are approaching Malcolm's cell. Past Malcolm are two experienced 
	PRISONERS who have been watching Malcolm during the scene. They whisper 
	surreptitiously without moving their bodies, and barely moving their 
	lips. One of the prisoners is PETE, a huge barrel of a man, a lifer --
	beaten by the system and a lifetime of incarceration. The other is 
	BEMBRY, a man of no great physicality, but who possesses immediately 
	the gift of leadership. It is clear that Pete and others look up to him 
	with great respect.
<b> 
</b><b>				PETE
</b>		Looka Satan.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		I see him.
<b> 
</b>	Bembry's language is very unhip. He speaks carefully. He respects words 
	and he respects himself, something which sets him apart from all the 
	other prisoners.
<b> 
</b><b>				PETE
</b>		He bout to bust.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		No, he's not gonna bust. But he's not gonna fix 
		his face to please them, neither.

	ANGLE. The check-in has reached the man next to Malcolm.

<b>				GUARD WILKINS 
</b>		Harrington.
<b> 
</b><b>				THIRD PRISONER

</b><b>				GUARD WILKINS 
</b>		Little.

</b>	ANGLE. Bembry in the FG of the scene. 

<b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		He's a new fish, Mr. Barnes. Give him a break.
<b> 
</b>	It's a bold step by Bembry and the prisoners look over at him with
	admiration. Barnes accepts the irregularity and calls over to Bembry.

<b>				GUARD BARNES 
</b>		0kay, I'll give him a break. Now state your 
		number, Little.
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I forgot it.
<b> 
</b><b> 	CLOSE SHOT - BEMBRY
</b>
	Shaking his head in anguish. He knows what's coming. 

	ANGLE. Barnes makes a small gesture and Wilkins seizes Malcolm, 
	grabbing his head and uniform at the same time. Stenciled on the chest 
	of his faded dungarees is Malcolm's number. The guard bends Malcolm's 
	head to the number, shoving the material in Malcolm's face.
<b> 
</b><b>				GUARD WILKINS 
</b>		Can you read, boy? Thass your number.
<b> 
</b><b>				GUARD BARNES 
</b>		Now say it.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I'm Malcolm Little, not no goddam number.
<b> 
</b><b>				GUARD WILKINS 
</b>		Oh, yes you is, baby; thass all you is.
<b> 
</b>	And slams Malcolm hard. He slumps to the floor.
<b> 
</b><b>				GUARD BARNES 
</b>		Two days in the hole. Take him.
<b> 
</b>	Wilkins drags Malcolm off as Barnes resumes the roll call.

</b><b> 
</b>	Only the faintest light comes into the hideous room, which consists of

	he could touch both walls. He lies half on the stone floor, half on the
 	mattress.
<b> 
</b>	A clang as the heavy door is opened.
<b> 
</b><b>				GUARD CONE
</b>		Time's up. Get on your feet.

	Malcolm sits stony-faced, his back against a wall. 

<b>				TRUSTEE'S VOICE
</b>		Water.
<b> 
</b>	The long spigot of a watering can is pushed through an opening in 
	the cell door. Malcolm, animal-like, leaps at it and bends the spout, 
	wrenching it off in his fury.

<b> 
</b><b>107	INT. SOLITARY - NIGHT 
</b>
	Malcolm is alone at the bars: the hope of freedom filling his mind.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm pulls at the bars, tries to shake them in impotent fury. He 
	pounds the walls. Empty, sick, defeated, his nails scratching the 
	walls, he slides to the floor of the cell.

	It is the low point of his life: nowhere to turn, nothing to hope for.
<b> 
</b><b>108  INT. SOLITARY - LATER
</b><b> 
</b>	Guard Cone is shaking him into consciousness.

</b>	He is beaten.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b><b>		A 859912.
</b><b> 
</b>	A shower is heard.

<b>109 	INT. SHOWER ROOM - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>	Malcolm stands with bowed head as the hot water cascades over his 
	broken body. He lets it run and run, but it cannot really touch his 
	problems. On a nearby bench are his clothes, his towel and the makings 
	for a conk: lye, Vaseline, comb, etc.
<b> 
</b>	He turns for a moment as he sees he is being watched by someone. It's 
	Bembry standing nearby. Malcolm turns away, trying to find solace in 
	the water. He wants no part of the world or anyone, just to be left 
	alone.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		I know how you feel. Like you want to lay down 
		and die.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm shows no flicker of interest or understanding.
<b> 
</b>				BEMBRY (contd) 
		I brought you something.
<b> 
</b>	He puts down a small matchbox on the bench next to Malcolm's things. 
	Malcolm eyes him like a snake -- but the punishment has reduced him to 
	deep insecurity and his belligerence is more cautious than angry.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Who the hell are you?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Man, what do you want?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		You need something. It's not a reefer, but 
		it'll help some.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Man, get outa my face. I ain't nobody's punk.
<b> 
</b>	But he steps out of the shower, fills a tin cup with water and empties 
	the contents of the matchbox into it. And drinks it down quickly.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Sit down or it might knock you down.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm sits, toweling himself as the spice hits him. For the first, he 
	smiles; this is the first relief he has tasted in prison. He at Bembry 
	wonderingly, unable to figure him out.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your 
		hype?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		I can show you how to get out of prison. And 
		it's no hype.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM
</b>		Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. 
		You got some more?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		What did you give it to me for then?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear 
		me without it.
<b> 
</b>	This is a new breed of cat; Malcolm has never met anyone like him. He 
	eyes him closely, as he slips into his clothes.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		What in the hell are you talking about?
<b> 
</b>	He begins to conk his hair, but is paying attention to what Bembry is 
	saying.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		I think you got more sense than any cat in this 
		prison. How come you are such a fool?
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm looks over, piqued.
<b> 
</b>				BEMBRY (contd) 
		Nobody can bust out like Bogart does it, in the
		 movies. Because even if you get out, you are 
		still in prison.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm is putting the conk into his hair now.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		You ain't lying.

<b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		When you go busting your fists against a stone 
		wall, you're not using your brains. Cause 
		that's what the white man wants you to do. Look 
		at you.
<b> 
</b>	These last words are spoken sharply with disgust. Malcolm turns his 
	hands massaging the conk into his hair.
<b> 
</b>				BEMBRY (contd) 
		Putting all that poison in your hair.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Man, you been locked up too long, everybody 
		conks. All the cats.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Why? Why does everybody conk?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Cause I don't want to walk around with my head 
		all nappy, looking like--
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! 
		Why don't you want to look like what you are? 
		What makes you ashamed of being black?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I ain't said I'm ashamed.
<b> 
</b>	He turns the water on to wash out the conk -- which has begun to burn. 
	Bembry restrains him, holding his arm.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Leggo. I got to wash it out.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
<b> 
</b>	But it is burning now.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Man, you better get off me.
<b> 
</b>	He wrenches away from Bembry and puts his head in the water.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Sure, burn yourself, pain yourself, put all 
		that poison into your hair, into your body -- 
		trying to be white.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Man, I don't want to hear all that.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		I thought you was smart. But you just another 
		one of them cats strutting down the avenue in 
		your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like 
		a monkey. And the white man sees you and he 
		laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't 
		white.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm is drying his hair, finishing his conk. But some of what Bembry 
	has said disturbs him.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Who are you?
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm is completely humiliated. Bembry sees this and stops the 
	barrage.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		The question is, who are you? You are in the 
		darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah 
		Muhammad can bring you into the light.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Elijah who?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out 
		of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want 
		is another fix. I thought you were smart.
<b> 
</b>	And he is gone. Malcolm stands looking after him, a long thoughtful 
	moment. He is pulling the comb through his hair.
<b> 
</b><b>110 	INT. PRISON LICENSE SHOP - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>	PRISONERS are working on a beltline that stamps out and finishes 
	license plates. Bembry is on the stamping machines, working as he talks 
	to the other prisoners. Malcolm is painting the plates, a little 
	removed from Bembry, but listening with interest. Barnes, with rifle, 
	idles by a window.
<b> 
</b>	A whistle sounds, ending the work shift. The inmates quickly file out 
	into the yard. Bembry stays. Malcolm is half decided.
<b> 
</b><b>				GUARD BARNES 
</b>		You taking the yard?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		I'm staying.
<b> 
</b>	Barnes gestures to Malcolm.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Me too.

	He goes.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave 
		you your last fix.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you 
		scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		What's he gonna do to me he ain't already done?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		You the only cat don't come on with that 
		"Whatcha know, daddy" jive; and you don't cuss 
		none.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't 
		got the words to say what's on his mind.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Don't con me. Don't try...

<b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Okay, okay.

<b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Don't con me. 
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		What do you do with your time?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		I read. I study. Because the first thing a 
		black man has to do is respect himself. Respect 
		his body and his mind. Quit taking the white 
		man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, 
		his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his 
		pork.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		That's what Mama used to say.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Your mama had sense because the pig is a filthy 
		beast: part rat, part cat, and the rest is dog.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm has been pondering all this and now grows animated as he thinks 
	he has come to the essence of a hustle.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Come on, daddy, pull my coat. What happens if 
		you give all that up? You get sick or somethin'? 
		I pulled a hustle once and got out of the draft.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm 
		talking the words of Elijah, the black man's 
		God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		What? Everybody knows God is White.
<b> 
</b>				BEMBRY (contd) 
		But everything the white man taught you, you 
		learned. He told you you were a black heathen 
		and you believed him. He told you how he took 
		you out of darkness and brought you to the 
		light. And you believed him. He taught you to 
		worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin
		-- and you believed him. He told you black was 
		a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look 
		up the word black in the dictionary?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		What for?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Did you ever study anything wasn't part of 
		some con?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM
</b>		What the hell for, man?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Go on, fool; the marble shooters are waiting 
		for you.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Okay, okay. Show me, man.
<b> 
</b><b>110A 	CLOSE SHOT - A DICTIONARY
</b><b> 
</b>	WE CAN READ the fine print of the definition:
<b> 
</b><b>				DICTIONARY
</b>		Black, (blak), adj. Destitute of light, devoid 
		of color, enveloped in darkness. Hence, utterly 
		dismal or gloomy, as "the future looked black."
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM'S VOICE
</b>		You understand them words?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY'S VOICE 
</b>		Read it.
<b> 
</b>	PULLBACK TO SHOW Bembry and Malcolm in a small PRISON LIBRARY. No one 
	else is in the book-lined room.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I can't make out that shit.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Soiled with dirt, foul; sullen, hostile, 
		forbidding -- as a black day. Foully or 
		outrageously wicked, as black cruelty. 
		Indicating disgrace, dishonor or culpability.
<b> 
</b><b>				DICTIONARY
</b>		See also blackmail, blackball, blackguard.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Hey, they's some shit, all right.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Now look up "white."
<b> 
</b>	Bembry turns the pages of the dictionary to "w."
<b> 
</b>				BEMBRY (contd) 
		Read it.
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE SHOT - DICTIONARY DEFINITION OF "WHITE"
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM'S VOICE
</b>		White (whit), adj. Of the color of pure snow; 
		reflecting all the rays of the spectrum. The 
		opposite of black, hence free from spot or 
		blemish; innocent, pure, without evil intent, 
		harmless. Honest, square-dealing, honorable.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm stumbles through the definition as well as he can. Bembry takes 
	over the reading, giving it ironic emphasis.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. 
		Ain't all these white man's books?
<b> 
</b><b>	SHOT - THE SHELVES OF BOOKS
</b><b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Then what you telling me to study in them for?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		You got to learn everything the white man says 
		and use it against him. The truth is laying 
		there if you smart and read behind their words. 
		It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking 
		at?
<b> 
</b>	Bembry smiles at Malcolm. He is a remarkable man who always takes 
	careful measure of his listener. He never talks down to his audience; 
	he talks to them. (A manner Malcolm later will adopt.) Bembry can talk
 	funky or salty or, as we will see, in the cadence and eloquence of the 
	Bible. Right now he goes into street talk.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		I'll pull your coat, daddy. Cause lots of these 
		can't nobody read, be he black or white or a 
		Ph.D. with their suspenders dragging the ground 
		with degrees.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm laughs. He likes and admires the man. Then caught by a passage 
	he does not understand:
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Man, I'm studying in the man's book. I don't dig 
		half the words.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Look 'em up and and out what they mean.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Where am I gonna start?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Start at the beginning. Page one, the first 
		one. Here--
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE SHOT
</b><b> 
</b>	As Bembry's hand opens the book to page one.

<b>	CLOSE IN ON A PICTURE OF AN AARDVARK WITH ITS DEFINITION
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Aardvark, noun. An earth pig; an ant-eating 
		African mammal. Man, that sounds like the

</b>		Read it and keep on reading. 

	Malcolm's finger runs down to the next definition:

</b>
<b>113	INT. MALCOLM'S CELL - NIGHT 
</b>
	He is reading on his bunk as Barnes walks by. The lights in the cell go 
	out. Malcolm looks up, annoyed at being interrupted. He shifts his 
	position to the floor of the cell so that he can catch the dim light 
	coming from the corridor and goes on with his reading. 

<b>	CLOSE SHOT - THE BOOK 
</b>
	Malcolm is studying the dictionary, the last of the "a's": the words
	azimuth, Azores, Aztec, azure, etc. He reads a word, then holds his 
	hand over the printed definition to test himself, half-mouthing its 
	meaning. Malcolm is also copying the dictionary in a school book word 
	for word.
<b> 
</b><b>114 	INT. LIBRARY - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>	There are several books on the desk before Malcolm. WE SEE their 
	titles: W.E.B. DuBois's _The Soul of Black Folks_, Carter G. Woodson's 
	_Journal of Negro History_, Durant's _Story of Philosophy_, H.G. 
	Wells's _Outline of History_, Spinoza, Thoreau, etc.
<b> 
</b><b>				GUARD BARNES'S VOICE
</b>		Closing. Knock it off.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm is surprised the time has gone so fast. He gathers up his books 
	with care. He cherishes them, putting them back on the shelf carefully.
<b> 
</b><b>				GUARD BARNES
</b>		You studying to be the first colored 
		President of the States?
<b> 
</b><b>115	INT. LICENSE SHOP - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>	The machines are idle; no one is in the room but Malcolm. He starts 
	to reach inside his jacket when Barnes sticks his head in.
<b> 
</b><b>				GUARD BARNES 
</b>		You taking the yard or not?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I'm staying.
<b> 
</b><b>				GUARD BARNES 
</b>		Then give me a butt.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm takes out a half-filled pack of cigarettes, about to offer one, 
	then pauses. Malcolm hands him the pack of cigarettes.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Take 'em. I don't smoke no more.
<b> 
</b>	He takes the pack happily and goes. Malcolm reaches into his jacket 
	again, takes out a book. WE SEE its title: Mahatma Gandhi's _My 
	Struggle_. He sits next to the license press to read.
<b> 
</b><b>116	EXT. THE PRISON YARD - DAY 
</b>
	A baseball game is in progress. A BLACK TEAM is playing a WHITE ONE. 
	Most of the CONVICTS are watching the game; partisanship at every 
	pitch. A base hit gets a big reaction. 

<b>	ANGLE - MALCOLM AND BEMBRY 
</b>
	They are out along the right field wall. They walk throughout the scene.

	ANGLE - The ball is hit over the fence for a home run. There is a big 
	cheer from the black prisoners. Pete, the batter, trots proudly around 
	the bases.
<b>  
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay 
		in there with the wood.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Lemme tell you about history: black history. 
		You listening?
<b> 
</b>	TWO-SHOT - Malcolm still watching the game.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		The first men on earth were black. They ruled 
		and there was not one white face anywhere. But 
		they teach us that we lived in caves and swung 
		from trees. Black men were never like that.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm is listening to Bembry's intent statement.
<b> 
</b>				BEMBRY (contd) 
		We were a race of kings when the white men went 
		around on all fours.
<b> 
</b>	There is a crack of the bat and Malcolm turns to watch another base 
	hit, by a black convict, stir the crowd.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		This a helluva game. Somethin's going on.
<b> 
</b>	He sees a black convict, CHUCK, nearby and calls over:
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		Hey, whatsa score?
<b> 
</b><b>				CHUCK
</b>		10 to 1; we murdering them, Din't you hear?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		What?
<b> 
</b><b>				CHUCK
</b>		The Brooklyn Dodgers brought up Jackie Robinson 
		and we pounding the hell out of them, 
		celebrating.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		How bout that?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Sure, white man throw us a bone and that's 
		supposed to make us forget 400 years.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		A black man playing big league ball is 
		something.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		I told you to go behind the words and dig out 
		the truth. They let us sing and dance and 
		smile -- and now they let one black man in the 
		majors. That don't cancel out the greatest 
		crime in history. When that blue-eyed devil 
		locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- 
		broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off 
		from our language, our religion, our history.

<b>	SHOTS OF THE FACES OF THE BLACK BALL PLAYERS AND THE CONVICTS
</b><b> 
</b>	In the stands, cheering and joyous.
<b> 
</b>				BEMBRY (contd) 
		Do they know who they are? Do you know where 
		you came from? We are the Original People.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm is listening to him now.
<b> 
</b>				BEMBRY (contd) 
		What's your name, boy?
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm is startled; answers like a boy.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Little.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		No. That's the name of the slave-master who 
		owned your family. You don't even know who you 
		are. You're nothing. Less than nothing. A zero. 
		Who are you?
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM

	Wrapped in thought.

</b>
	Malcolm cannot answer because he truly does not know.
<b> 
</b>	A ball is hit. Malcolm watches its flight but his face is fixed 
	somewhere between understanding and anger: it is the face of the future 
	leader.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY

		Shabazz in the wilderness of North America.
<b>

</b><b> 
</b>	The rays of the sun come through bars that cut across Malcolm and 
	Bembry's face.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named 
		Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm--
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Then the devil is white.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the 
		devil. All white men are devils.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I sure met some.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white 
		man is a devil." He teaches us that the white 
		man is the devil. All white men.
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE SHOT - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>	Listening.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Have you ever known a good white man in all 
		your life? Think back, did you ever meet one 
		who wasn't evil?

<b>120	INT. A NICHE IN A PRISON WALL - P.M.
</b>
	Malcolm and Bembry standing close together. The feeling is of someone 
	taking communion: with Bembry the minister and Malcolm the communicant. 
	Their voices are little more than whispers.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		The body is a holy repository.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I will not touch the white man's poison: his 
		drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		A Muslim must be strikingly upright. 
		Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see 
		the power of the light.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm lifts his head.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I will do it.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		But the key to Islam is submission. That is why 
		twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of 
		Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
<b> 
</b>	Bembry kneels in a praying position. Malcolm stands.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I can't.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, 
		implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing 
		on earth--
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		--the hardest and the greatest.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM

<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY

<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I don't know what to say to Allah.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Have you ever bent your knees, Malcolm?
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm laugh-snorts:
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob 
		somebody's house.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Tell Him that.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I don't know how.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		You can grovel and crawl for sin, but not to 
		save your soul. Pick the lock, Malcolm; pick 
		it.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I want to. God knows I want to.
<b> 
</b><b>121	INT. MALCOLM'S CELL-NIGHT
</b>
	Malcolm holds a letter in his hand. He reads it carefully. He has read 
	it several times before.
<b> 
</b><b>				VOICE OF MALCOLM X
</b>		I received a letter that day from the Honorable 
		Elijah Muhammad. The Messenger of Allah wrote 
		me, a nobody, a junkie, a pimp and a convict.
<b> 
</b><b>				VOICE OF ELIJAH 
</b>		I have come to give you something which can 
		never be taken from you: I bring you a sense of 
		your own worth, the worth of one human being. 
		The knowledge of self.
<b> 
</b>	The room becomes transformed. It is suddenly suffused with light. And 
	standing in the cell with Malcolm is ELIJAH MUHAMMAD. He has 
	materialized, but he can be seen through. He is MALCOLM'S 
<b>	HALLUCINATION.
</b><b> 
</b><b>				VOICE OF MALCOLM X 
</b>		It was like a blinding light and I became aware 
		that he was in the room with me. He wore a dark 
		suit and on his face I saw a pain so old and 
		deep and black I could scarcely look at him. I 
		knew I was not dreaming. He was there.
<b> 
</b><b>				ELIJAH 
</b>		I tell you that the most dangerous creation of 
		any society in the world is the man with 
		nothing to lose. You do not need ten such men 
		to change the world. One will do. The Earth

</b>	The hallucination disappears.
<b>

		And then I could do it.

</b><b>

	Muslim banner. It is dinner time in a Muslim home.
<b> 
</b>	SIDNEY, aged 20, a perfect specimen of the Fruit of Islam, stands 
	behind his chair, waiting. Their mother, LORRAINE, a woman of Bembry's

<b> 
</b>	He comes to the table, nods and sits. Sidney respectfully sits after

	SIMMONS. A BLACK BARBER - SLIM sits by. Both are convicts. NOTE: 
	Malcolm now wears glasses, all that reading in his badly lit cell has

</b><b> 
</b><b>	TITLE - 6 YEARS LATER
</b><b> 
</b>	A GROUP OF PRISONERS, mostly white, but with a goodly smattering of 
	black convicts, are listening to a lecture by CHAPLAIN GILL.
<b> 
</b><b>  				CHAPLAIN GILL 
</b>		Are there any questions?
<b> 
</b>	ANGLE. Malcolm seated next to a black convict, raises his hand. It's 
	the only hand up. The Chaplain searches for another questioner, but 
	there aren't any.
<b> 
</b>	Pete, sitting next to Malcolm, whispers.
<b> 
</b><b>				PETE
</b>		Watch out, baby, this cat is heavy on religion.
<b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>				CHAPLAIN GILL 
</b>		I see this has become a struggle between good 
		and evil. Satan has a question.
<b> 
</b>	There is laughter from the convicts.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Yes it is, Chaplain Gill. But I wouldn't want 
		to say which one of us is what.
<b> 
</b>	Laughter, especially from the black convicts.
<b> 
</b><b>				CHAPLAIN GILL 
</b>		Why don't you just ask your question?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		You've been talking about the disciples. What 
		color were they?
<b> 
</b><b>				CHAPLAIN GILL 
</b>		I don't think we know for certain.
<b> 
</b>	There are reactions from the convicts. Malcolm is sharply challenging a 
	white man about color.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		They were Hebrew, weren't they?
<b> 
</b><b>				CHAPLAIN GILL 
</b>		That's right.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
<b> 
</b><b>				CHAPLAIN GILL 
</b>		Just what is your question?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		What color were the original Hebrews?
<b> 
</b><b>				CHAPLAIN GILL 
</b>		I told you we don't know for certain.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Then we don't know that God was white.
<b> 
</b>	There is a strong reaction to this.
<b> 
</b><b>				CHAPLAIN GILL 
</b>		Now just a moment, just a moment--
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		But we do know that the people of that region 
		of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley 
		to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. 
		I've studied drawings and photographs and seen 
		newsreels. I have never seen a native of that 
		area who was not black.
<b> 
</b><b>				CHAPLAIN GILL 
</b>		Just what are you saying?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I'm not saying anything, preacher. I'm proving 
		to you that God is black.

<b> 
</b><b>128	INT. ELIJAH'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>	Malcolm opens the door, the room is dark and he sees a small, slight 
	man standing against the window, he doesn't move. This is the same man 
	who appeared in Malcolm's cell, this is the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. 
	Malcolm slowly moves toward him; he is completely humbled in his 
	presence.
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - ELIJAH
</b><b> 
</b>	He turns from the window to Malcolm.
<b> 
</b><b>				ELIJAH 
</b>		My son, you've been a thief, drug dealer and a
		pimp and the world is still full of temptation. 
		When God bragged how faithful Job was, the 
		devil argued that only God's protective hedge 
		around him kept him pure, the devil said remove 
		the hedge and he will curse his maker. 
		Malcolm, your hedge has been removed and I 
		believe you will remain faithful.
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>	He cannot say anything and he drops his head, he is overwhelmed with 
	heartfelt emotion.
<b> 
</b><b>129	INT. BEMBRY'S LIVING ROOM - P.M.
</b><b> 
</b>	In contrast to the peaceful family scene, the room is a beehive of 
	activity. Sidney is turning out leaflets on a mimeograph machine; 
	Lorraine is busy making up a mailing list using 3 x 5 file cards; 
	Bembry is recruiting on the telephone.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		How many you turning out?
<b> 
</b><b>				SIDNEY 
</b><b>		500.
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
<b> 
</b><b>				SIDNEY 
</b>		Brother Malcolm, I want you to meet Brother 
		Earl. He just joined the Nation.
<b> 
</b>	Earl moves toward Malcolm and extends his hands. Malcolm shakes it 
	warmly.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		We can always use another good brother.
<b> 
</b><b>				EARL
</b>		I'm a willing servant for Allah.
<b> 
</b><b>129A 	EXT. CHURCH - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>	Sunday service has let out and Malcolm, Earl, and Sidney are "fishing." 
	They're trying to convert the Black Christians. Malcolm speaks, while 
	the others hand out leaflets.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		You think you are Christians, and yet you see 
		your so-called white Christian brother hanging 
		black Christians on trees. You say that white 
		man loves you and yet he has done every evil 
		act against you. He has everything while he is 
		living and tells you to be a good slave and 
		when you die you will have more than he has in 
		Beulah's land. We so-called Negroes are in 
		pitiful shape. Get off your knees praying to 
		a picture of a white, pale blond, and blue-eyed 
		Jesus. Come out of the sky. Build heaven on 
		earth. Islam is the black man's true religion.
<b> 
</b><b>130	EXT. STREET CORNER, 125TH AND SEVENTH AVENUE - DAY 
</b>
	Malcolm is talking to a CROWD from a ladder.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		And that the white man is the devil. Yes, God 
		is black and you are made in His image and 
		don't know it. That's how brainwashed you are.

 	The crowd is listening, caught up in Malcolm's intensity.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		My brothers and sisters, they tell you you will 
		sprout wings when you die and fly to heaven. 
		The Honorable Elijah Muhammad tells you that's 
		pie in the sky.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE ON SIDNEY
</b><b> 
</b>	Amid the listeners, watching their response.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM'S VOICE
</b>		Have you ever seen a black man who wasn't down 
		on his knees begging the Lord to give him in 
		heaven what the white devil enjoys right here 
		on earth?
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE SHOT - SEVERAL LISTENERS
</b>
	They turn from Malcolm, moving a few steps away, and now are the 
	audience on an adjacent SPEAKER. He is a young firebrand:
<b> 
</b><b>				SPEAKER 
</b>		The Harlem Council fights for rat control, for 
		rent control and for community control of our 
		schools.
<b> 
</b>	PAN CONTINUES to take in ANOTHER SPEAKER, a few feet away. WE SEE the 
	street corner is Harlem's Hyde Park, with half a dozen SPEAKERS 
	haranguing the crowd with half a dozen panaceas. That Malcolm is just 
	one among many:

<b>				SECOND SPEAKER
</b>		If the man behind the counter ain't black, 
		don't go in. Boycott the man. Be black. Think 
		black. Buy black.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Come to our Temple and hear the truth. Because, 
		brother and sister, you are dead. Yes you are, 
		mentally dead, spiritually dead, morally dead. 
		And we are here to resurrect the black man 
		back from the dead.
<b> 
</b><b>131	EXT. OPEN AIR "MAID'S MARKET" - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>	A place where black women come to offer themselves for day work. 
	SEVERAL ARE SEEN. A WHITE WOMEN comes up to one to interview her 
	(bargain with her). Malcolm's voice is heard before he is seen, 
	speaking to the women from a ladder.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM'S VOICE
</b>		My beautiful sister, for you are beautiful. 
		Beautiful because you are black. Because black 
		is beautiful. You work in the white folks' 
		kitchen so I don't have to tell you that 
		they're devils.
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		And you are putting yourselves on the auction 
		block, letting them examine you like a horse, 
		like a slave. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad 
		teaches that you are black and should be 
		proud...
<b> 
</b>	FACE OF ONE BLACK WOMAN, beginning to shake her head in accord.
<b> 
</b><b>132	INT. TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>	The SAME WOMAN, now at a Muslim meeting. The faces of other listeners 
	(from the church and from the maids' market) are scattered in Malcolm's 
	audience.
<b> 
</b>	The headquarters itself shows the progress Malcolm has made. It is 
	better furnished, larger, and the chairs are filled. Bembry, Sidney, 
	and Lorraine are in the back of the room, pleased with the growth. 
	Malcolm stands at a podium.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		We're not American, we're Africans who happen 
		to be in America. We were kidnapped and brought 
		here against our will from Africa. We didn't 
		land on Plymouth Rock, brothers and sister. 
		Plymouth Rock landed on us.
<b> 
</b>	Reactions: laughter, interest. Ad lib "That's the truth."
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Put an end to your begging. No more "Please, 
		Mr. White Man, Lawdy boss, brush me another 
		crumb from off your table, kindly, sir."  We 
		are a nation, a great nation and don't need a 
		thing from them.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm scanning the faces of his audience as they react. He sees 
	someone he knows and blurts out boyishly (and winningly):
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		Shorty!
<b> 
</b>	The crowd turns to Shorty, sitting embarrassedly in the audience.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		Come on up here, man, and give us some skin. 
		Here's a man, brothers and sisters, who shot 
		up with me, who robbed with me, and did time in 
		the white devil's jailhouse. Stand up, Shorty, 
		and be counted--
<b> 
</b>	But Shorty is trying to hide from the spotlight. Malcolm comes down 
	from the platform and walks to him.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		Folks, the brother is shy and needs special 
		attention. So would you excuse us, while Brothers 
		Sidney and Earl take up the collection.

	He embraces Shorty as the crowd laughs appreciatively and Brothers 
	Sidney and Earl have a chuckle themselves.
<b> 
</b><b>133	INT. MUSLIM CAFETERIA - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>	Shortly and Malcolm sit at a table. Shorty has a cup of coffee in front 
	of him.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		I got to hand it to you, Homey. That's the best 
		preacher hype I ever did hear.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I 
		said: join us.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should 
		pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How 
		about a snort?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I 
		ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the 
		ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white 
		tail yet.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
<b> 
</b><b>				SHORTY 
</b>		Well, Sammy's dead. Yeah, fell over in the bed 
		with a chick twenty years younger than him. Had 
		twenty-five grand in his pocket.
<b> 
</b>133A 	INSERT FLASH - Sammy, he's dead on top of TEENAGE WHORE who is

<b> 
</b>133B 	INSERT FLASH - Cadillac is an old junkie, past reclaiming, sitting 
	staring in a MENTAL WARD, twitching, nose running.
<b>

<b> 
</b><b>134 	INT. A DINGY ROOM - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>	A knock on the door rouses Archie, by now an old and dying man. All the 
	vigor is gone, all the life has ebbed out.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		Git the hell away, you bitch, I'll pay you 
		tomorrow.
<b> 
</b>	Door opens, Malcolm enters.

<b>  				MALCOLM 
</b>		Hello, Archie.

 	Archie sits up from his bed and stares. He tries to bring back some of
	his old juice, tries to stand up.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		My man, Red. Come on in, man. 
			(then giving up) 
		Hey, I can't make it.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm has to help him lie back.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Take it easy, baby.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		That really you, Red?

	The contrast is shocking: Malcolm tall and straight; Archie ruined.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of 
		Harlem. When I think how close we came to 
		gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.

<b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my 
		rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but 
		did you have that number? Tell me.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is 
		we got to get you back on your feet.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been 
		figured yet. All I need's a stake and a 
		chance--
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, 
		but--
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE 
</b>		No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks. 

<b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
<b> 
</b><b>				ARCHIE
</b>		Yeah.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		You could of been something, Archie, but the

<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		You know all the angles except how to live. 

<b>135 	EXT. A STREET IN HARLEM - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>	Malcolm walks thoughtfully down the street; Archie is still on his 
	mind, as he passes prostitute after prostitute. Once beautiful women 
	now selling their bodies. He passes Laura, she has been turned totally 
	out and she looks the part, there is no way he can recognize her. We do 
	though. 

<b>	CLOSE - LAURA
</b><b>

		engineers; Who is going to be the head of the 
		households?--
<b> 
</b><b>136 	INT. TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>	Malcolm is addressing a HUGE AUDIENCE. His tone is more intense, more 
	personal than before, because of his recent encounters. In the 
	audience, sitting with Bembry, is BETTY, a lovely dark-skinned woman. 
	Her interest in Malcolm (true, also, for most of the other unmarried 
	sisters) is more than religious.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		--and what has the white devil made of them: 
		dead souls. Oh, my he has no conscience. He 
		should fall on his knees and say, "My kind 
		commits history's greatest crime against your 
		kind every day of your life." But does he? No. 
		He scorns you, splits your head with his 
		nightstick and calls you nigger. If you've had 
		it, then stand up and come forward. If not us, 
		then who? If not now, then when?
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE
</b><b> 
</b>	Many stand, some walk toward the podium speaking his name: "I'm with 
	you, Brother Malcolm," "Praise Allah," "Me, Brother Malcolm."
<b>  
</b>	There is applause; some of the audience get to their feet -- Malcolm 
	acknowledges their approval, trying to quiet them, but caught up in the
 	heady excitement of leadership.
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - BETTY AND BEMBRY
</b><b> 
</b>	Both are moved by Malcolm's performances.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>			(whispering) 
		He ought to try to make it a little easier, 
		Brother Bembry.
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		Why don't you try telling him that, Sister 
		Betty?
<b> 
</b><b>137	INT. A LARGE ANTEROOM IN TEMPLE #7 - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>	The Muslim movement has grown enormously. The activity in this 
	anteroom, leading to other rooms off it, shows that. Betty and Bembry 
	stand before a Directory announcing activities in the Temple: MONDAY - 
	Fruit of Islam Meeting; TUESDAY - Unity Night; WEDNESDAY - Student 
	Enrollment; THURSDAY - Muslim Girls Training; FRIDAY - General
	Civilization Class; SATURDAY - Swahili, etc.
<b> 
</b>	A stir of people and activity as Malcolm enters the anteroom. He 
	excuses himself from a group of MUSLIMS, making his way toward Bembry.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>			(little out of breath) 
		Brother Bembry, can we fix it so our 
		loudspeaker is heard on the street?
<b> 
</b><b>				BEMBRY 
</b>		I'm sure we can. This is a new sister, Sister 
		Betty.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm nods at her; she nods in return.
<b> 
</b>				BEMBRY (contd) 
		The Sister lectures our Muslim women in hygiene 
		and diet.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm mutters "very good," but his mind is clearly on a million other 
	details.
<b> 
</b>				BEMBRY (contd) 
		The Sister stresses care of the body and 
		regular eating habits.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm is still distracted.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		The Sister wonders if the Brother knows what 
		Harriet Tubman did between taking souls to the 
		Promised Land?
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm is stopped. He looks at Betty.
<b> 
</b><b> 				MALCOLM 
</b>		What?
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		She ate.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm laughs.

				BETTY (contd) 
		And the Sister suggests he put his actions 
		where his mouth is.
<b>

<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to 
		talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a

<b>								CUT TO:

</b><b> 
</b><b>				ELIJAH 
</b>		No. We are not Catholic priests. We do not

		height for a man, the right complexion, if her 
		age is half the man's plus seven, if she 
		understands that man's essential nature is

	They are alarmed at Brother Minister's behavior. 

<b>	TWO-SHOT - BETTY AND MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		If you'll start eating, there is a question I 
		have. Go ahead. Start.
<b> 
</b>	He takes a forkful of the salad.
<b> 
</b>				BETTY (contd) 
		Considering today's standards of animal raising 
		and curing meats, I don't fully understand the 
		restriction on pork.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. 
		I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's 
		demonstration purely in the interest of 
		science, you understand?
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY'S VOICE:
</b>		Yes, I understand, Brother Malcolm. Purely 
		scientific.
<b> 
</b><b>139 	INT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY - DAY

</b>	Before a comparative evolutionary display showing the skeletons of
 	various animals, Malcolm is holding forth. Betty is dressed in a vivid, 
	becoming red dress.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Notice especially the claw, the jaw and the 
		skull formation. This is the rat. This the 
		mole. Here you have the aardvark and the 
		boar...
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE ON THE SKELETONS
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM'S VOICE
</b>		...All members of the pig-rodent family.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		I see your point.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		So it is not a matter of the breeding 
		conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat 
		itself is foul.
<b> 
</b>	ANGLE. As they saunter out, passing the huge skeletons of prehistoric 
	animals now.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		Could we sit down someplace?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.

	He plunks down the order before Betty and Malcolm. Malcolm takes a 
	long, long satisfying pull on his straw. Then he sighs: 

<b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		What?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice 
		cream soda.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY 
</b>		How do you like it?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Delicious.
<b> 
</b>	She laughs. He blushes.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		Let's talk about you for a change.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		There's nothing to talk about.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		0h, yes, there is. I know a lot about you.
		Brother Bembry briefed me.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>			(a beat) 
		You're from Detroit, near where I come from. 
		You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're 
		studying nursing and having trouble with your 
		family.
<b>  
</b><b>				BETTY
</b> 		I can handle it.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't 
		pay your tuition, isn't that it?
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		You have enough worries of your own.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		No, good Sisters are rare. We need every one. 
		Tell me something: how tall are you?
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		Why do you ask?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Just an idle question.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
<b> 
</b>	She takes a bite of her sundae.
<b> 
</b>				BETTY (contd) 
		But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a 
		tall man.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		How old are you, Betty?
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		There's a few things you don't know about 
		women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and 
		vain.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Are you?
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		And dogged when I set my mind to something.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM
</b>		What have you set your mind to?
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good 
		wife.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm takes a good look at the lovely woman in front of him, then a 
	long sip from his ice cream soda.
<b> 
</b><b>				SIDNEY'S VOICE 
</b>		Brother Malcolm.

</b>	Betty sees him first.
<b>

</b>		It's Sidney.

</b>		There was a scuffle. The Brother was watching.

	Malcolm listening as SEVERAL WITNESSES simultaneously describe the 
	attack. A small angry CROWD has gathered. The most animated one is 
	BENJAMIN, a very dark young black teenager, we will soon meet him 
	later.

</b>		The cop says, "Move on."

</b><b>				MAN 
</b>		The Brother didn't scatter fast enough for the

</b><b>				MAN 
</b>		Watcha gonna do?
<b> 
</b><b>				VOICE FROM THE CROWD
</b>			(deprecatingly) 
		He'll rap a little. He's a Muslim. And make a 
		speech.
<b> 
</b><b>				ANOTHER VOICE FROM CROWD 
</b>		Muslims talk a good game, but they never do 
		nothing, unless somebody bothers Muslims.

	Malcolm's face goes taut. He nods sharply at Sidney, as Benjamin 
	watches them both.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM'S VOICE
</b>		I demand to see Brother Johnson.

</b>		Nobody here by that name.
<b> 
</b><b>				PLAINCLOTHES 
</b>		What's your name, feller?
<b> 
</b>	He feels the power play and stiffens in resistance.
<b>

</b>		I'm Minister Malcolm X. Two witnesses saw him

	OUT Benjamin among the crowd.

<b> 
</b><b>				SERGEANT
</b>		Yeah. We got a Muslim. The relief must of put it 
		down.
<b>

</b>		But you can't see him. You ain't his lawyer.

</b>		No lawyer, no see.
<b>

</b>		Until I'm satisfied Brother Johnson is 
		receiving proper medical attention, no one will

		That man belongs in a hospital. Get an ambulance. 
		Now! 

<b>145 	EXT. THE STREET - LATER (DARKER)
</b><b> 
</b>	As Johnson's body, on a stretcher, is hurried into an ambulance. The

<b> 
</b>	Malcolm with the Sergeant and a LIEUTENANT, as the ambulance pulls away.
<b> 
</b><b>				LIEUTENANT

<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		To the hospital.
<b> 
</b>	The Fruit of Islam fall in behind him, marching slowly. It takes on the

	(especially kids) race with them on the street and on the sidewalk.

</b><b> 
</b>	Benjamin fights his way through the crowd trying to walk beside Malcolm, 
	the Brothers in the Fruit stop him and Benjamin drops back.
<b> 
</b><b>146 	EXT. LENOX AVENUE - NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b> 	Now the march has taken over the broad avenue. COPS are forced to 
	redirect traffic, holding up crosstown cars as the group walks solemnly 
	by. The people walking behind have swelled it to a huge demonstration. 
	Their faces reflect their anger and their satisfaction that, for once, 
	something is being done about what has happened.
<b>

	He makes a gesture with his hand, the Fruit of Islam disperse.

</b>		Put fear into those devils.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I want to also, but until we are instructed by 
		the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and 
		pray.
<b> 
</b><b>				BROTHER EARL 
</b>		I'm tired of praying.
<b>

</b>		That's enough, Brother Earl.

</b>
	Brothers Sidney and Earl get up to intercept him but Malcolm waves him 
	through. Benjamin stands.

	white sugar.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		There is only one thing I like integrated. My

				MALCOLM (contd) 
		What can I do for you?
<b> 
</b><b>				BENJAMIN
</b>		Mr. X, I was out there tonight. I saw what you

		Do you?

</b>		Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.

	the room, is surprised and waits at the door. The two are alone 
	together.
<b> 
</b><b>				ELIJAH
</b>		If I surprise you, let me explain. Menial work 
		teaches us humility.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Let me do it then.
<b> 
</b><b>				ELIJAH 
</b>		No, each of us must relearn that work is the 
		only worthwhile thing. Allah has given you a 
		great gift. Use it wisely, never forgetting 
		that we are nothing, while He is all.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Allah Akbar.
<b> 
</b>	The sweeping done, they stand together near a table at a window.
<b> 
</b><b>				ELIJAH
</b>		Tonight I shall introduce you as my National 
		Representative. It will be a difficult task. 
		Your assignment is to build temples all over 
		this nation. More work than you have ever done 
		in your life and you will be in the public eye. 
		My son, beware of those cameras, they are just 
		as bad as a narcotic.

	ANGLE - AIDES and OTHERS come into the room now. They are listening.

				ELIJAH (contd) 
		Yes, the white devil will watch your every 
		step. Even your own Brothers will become 
		jealous, and hostile, go slowly. So I offer you 
		a parable -- regarding your work.
<b> 
</b>	Elijah picks up a glass and sets it before Malcolm.
<b> 
</b>				ELIJAH (contd) 
		Here is a glass, dirty and its water foul. If 
		you offer it to the people and they have no 
		choice, they must drink out of it. But if you 
		present them with this glass--
<b> 
</b>	He is holding a clean glass, with clear water in it.
<b> 
</b>				ELIJAH (contd) 
		--and let them make their decision, they will 
		choose the pure vessel. Islam is the only 
		religion which addresses the needs and problems 
		of the so-called Negro, especially in the

		crime, unemployment, prostitution, alcohol, 
		gambling, fornication and adultery.
<b> 
</b>	Elijah holds up the clear glass.
<b> 
</b><b>				VOICE OF MALCOLM X 
</b>		This sweet, gentle man gave me the truth from 
		his own mouth. And I adored him, in the sense 
		of the Latin root of the word. Adorare, to 
		worship and to fear. He was the first man I 
		ever feared -- not fear such as the one has of 
		a gun but the fear one has of the power of the 
		sun, I pledged myself to him, even if it cost

		nor a Democrat, not as a Mason nor an Elk, not 
		as a Christian nor a Jew, not as a Catholic nor 
		a Protestant, not as a Baptist nor a Methodist,

</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		Before there were any such things as Democrats

		the inhuman acts of bestial brutality practiced 
		by these semi-savage white policemen that 
		patrol our community, like the occupation 
		forces of a conquering enemy army... the black

		accusing the Honorable Elijah Muhammad of 
		teaching black supremacy when he tries to 
		uplift the mentality, the social, and economic 
		condition of black people in this country. And 
		the Jews, who have been guilty of exploiting

		Honorable Elijah Muhammad of being anti-Semitic 
		simply because he teaches our people to go into 
		business for ourselves and trying to take over 
		the economic leadership in our own community. 
		The black people in this country have been the 
		victims of violence at the hands of the white 
		man for 400 years, and following the ignorant 
		Negro preachers, we have thought that it was 
		God-like to turn the other cheek to the brute 
		that was brutalizing us. 100 years ago they 
		use to put on a white sheet and use a 
		bloodhound against Negroes. Today they've taken
		off sheets and put on police uniforms, they've 
		traded in the bloodhounds for police dogs. And 
		just as Uncle Tom back during slavery used to 
		keep the Negroes from resisting the bloodhounds 
		or resisting the Ku Klux Klan by telling them 
		to love their enemy or pray for those who use 
		them as spitefully today. The Honorable Elijah 
		Muhammad is showing black people that just as 
		the white man and every other person on this 
		earth has God given rights, natural rights,

</b><b> 
</b><b>				MODERATOR
</b>		Mr. X, before we start our discussion tonight 
		-- The Black Muslims: Hate Mongers -- would you 
		mind explaining for us the meaning of your 
		name, which is the letter X.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - PANEL 
</b>
	Opposing Malcolm is DR. PAYSON, a NAACP-type NEGRO. 

<b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Yes sir. As you know, during slavery time, the 
		slavemasters named most of the so-called 
		Negroes in America after themselves. Mr. Elijah 
		Muhammad teaches us once you come into the 
		knowledge of Islam, you replace your slave name 
		with an X. Since we've been disconnected, cut 
		off from our Eastern culture for so long that 
		we don't know the names we originally had, we 
		will use X until we get back to the East.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - MODERATOR
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MODERATOR
</b>		Thank you. Now Dr. Payson.
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - DR. PAYSON
</b><b> 
</b><b>				DR. PAYSON 
</b>		Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so 
		he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good 
		law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you 
		a question?
<b>  
</b><b>	CLOSE: - DR. PAYSON
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Please, go ahead.
<b> 
</b><b>				DR. PAYSON 
</b>		Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black 
		supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		For the white man to ask the black man if he 
		hates him is just like the rapist asking the 
		raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you 
		hate me!" The white man is in no moral position 
		to accuse anyone of hate.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - PANEL
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MODERATOR
</b>		Certainly, Mr. X, you must admit there has been 
		progress.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I'll talk about "progress" in a minute, but let 
		me finish with my brother.

	Malcolm gestures to the Negro panelist.  The BLACK MEMBERS of the TV 
	audience are lapping it up. Betty and Earl also sit in the TV studio 
	audience.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		Stop me if I'm wrong. I "polarize the community." 
		I "erroneously appraise the racial picture."
<b> 
</b><b>				DR. PAYSON 
</b>		You put it very well.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		You left one phrase out. Another educated 
		Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother 
		Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices 
		of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
<b> 
</b><b>				DR. PAYSON 
</b>		Entirely.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a 
		Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is 
		called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's 
		called a nigger.
<b> 
</b>	There is some blanching and guffawing from the audience. The moderator 
	is totally embarrassed, Betty roars.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		And I'm not finished. To understand this man--
<b> 
</b>	He points a sharp finger at the Negro Panelist.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		--you must know that historically there are two 
		kinds of slaves. House Negroes and Field 
		Negroes. The house Negro lived in the big 
		house; he dressed pretty good; he ate pretty 
		good and he loved the master. Yeah, he loved 
		him more than the master loved himself. If the 
		master's house caught fire, he'd be the first 
		to put the blaze out. If the master got sick, 
		he'd say: "What's a matter, boss; we sick?" 
		WE sick! If someone said to him, "Let's run 
		away and escape. Let's separate." He'd say, 
		"Man, are you crazy? What's better than what I 
		got here?" That was the House Negro. In those 
		days he was called the House Nigger. Well, 
		that's what we call them today because we still 
		got a lot of House Niggers running around.

</b><b> 
</b><b>				MODERATOR
</b>		I think, perhaps, Dr. Payson has something to--
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Don't you want to hear about the Field Nigger?
<b> 
</b><b>				DR. PAYSON 
</b>		Let him finish.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught 
		hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; 
		he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and 
		hated his master. If the house caught fire, 
		he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, 
		he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to 
		him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, 
		"Yeah, man, any place is better than this." 
		You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America 
		today. I'm one.
<b> 
</b><b>				BROTHER BENJAMIN 
</b>		Tell it.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		--there's another one. The majority of black 
		Americans today are Field Negroes. They don't

</b><b> 
</b><b>	EXT. STREET - HARLEM - DAY 
</b>
	Malcolm is walking the streets of Harlem like he is campaigning for

	follows him. Malcolm sees a WINO.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Brother Man, put that bottle down, take that 
		poison away from your lips. That's what the 
		devil wants you to do, stay high, out of your 
		natural mind. I know, I've been there.
<b> 
</b>	The wino looks at Malcolm and continues to drink his wine.
<b> 
</b>159H	--Malcolm emerges from a doorway to be met by an army of TV REPORTERS 
	armed with microphones. He walks; they follow.

<b> 
</b>	--Benjamin goes off in a corner and very quickly copies the letter,

<b> 
</b>	--Benjamin hands Malcolm his letter, Malcolm shakes his head and hands 
	it back, it's not exact.
<b> 
</b><b>159K	EXT. STREET - HARLEM - DAY

</b><b>

	Speaking to a packed STUDENT AUDIENCE. 

<b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		...My high school was the black ghetto of 
		Roxbury. My college was the streets of Harlem, 
		and I took my masters in prison. If you look 
		out the window--

<b>161A 	SHOT MALCOLM'S OLD GANG HANGOUT
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM'S VOICE
</b>		--you can see my burglary hangout. I lived 
		like an animal. Had it not been for the 
		Honorable Elijah Muhammad I would surely be in 
		an insane asylum or dead.
<b> 
</b>	ANGLE - The audience carefully listening.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Mr. Muhammad is trying to get us on God's side, 
		so God will be on our side to help us fight our 
		battles. When Negroes stop getting drunk, stop 
		being addicted to drugs, stop fornicating and
		committing adultery. When we get off the 
		welfare, then we'll be MEN. Earn what you need 
		for your family, then your family respects you. 
		They'll be proud to say "That's my father." 
		She's proud to say "That's my husband..." 
		Father means you're taking care of those 
		children. Just 'cause you made them that don't 
		mean you're a father. Anybody can make a baby, 
		but anybody can't take care of them. Anyone can 
		go and get a woman but anybody can't take care 
		of a woman. This is the type of teaching that 
		the honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us so we 
		can build the moral fiber of our people.
<b> 
</b><b>	SHOT OF REPORTERS IN AUDIENCE
</b><b> 
</b>	Beginning to scribble furiously.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I can see the gentlemen of the press, also the 
		FBI and CIA. are with us. Get it straight 'cuz 
		if I said, "Mary had a little lamb," they'd 
		write Malcolm X lampoons poor Mary.
<b> 
</b>	Loud laughter from the audience. But this response is overwhelmed by 
	the response of ANOTHER, LARGER AUDIENCE.
<b> 
</b><b>162	INT. MONSTER RALLY - NIGHT 
</b>
	Malcolm is talking before an all-black audience. It is the largest 
	rally yet; the hall is packed to the rafters.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		We have built temples in Boston, in Detroit, in 
		Atlanta, Philadelphia, Washington -- 100 
		temples in fifty states. From a handful we 
		have grown to scores of thousands.
<b> 
</b><b>	VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE RALLY 
</b>
	HAWKERS selling _The Messenger_, faces of Fruit of Islam near the 
	podium; Lorraine, Sidney, Earl, Benjamin, and Bembry. For the first 
	time a new note is seen in Bembry's face: reserve bordering on 
	resentment. When others around him cheer Malcolm, Bembry is cool. 
	Sidney notices this from his father, but makes no comment.

<b>				MALCOLM/HIS VOICE 
</b>		The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that 
		God is now about to establish a kingdom on this 
		earth based on brotherhood and 

<b>		[...]
</b>
		against peace, his history on this earth has 
		proved that. Nowhere in history has he been 
		brotherly toward anyone. The only time he has 
		been brotherly toward you is when he can use 
		you, when he can exploit you, when he can 
		oppress you, when you will submit to him. And 
		since his own history makes him unqualified to 
		be an inhabitant or a citizen in a kingdom of 
		brotherhood, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad 
		teaches us that God is about to eliminate that 
		particular race from this earth. So since they 
		are due for elimination, we don't want to be 
		with them.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - CROWD
</b><b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		If the so-called Negro were American citizens 
		we wouldn't have a race problem. If the 
		Emancipation Proclamation was authentic, you 
		wouldn't have a race problem. If the 13th, 
		14th, and 15th amendments to the Constitution 
		was authentic, you wouldn't have a race 
		problem. If the Supreme Court desegregation 
		decision was authentic, you wouldn't have a 
		race problem. All of this is hypocrisy. These 
		Negro leaders have been telling the white man 
		everything is all right, everything is under 
		control. And they've been telling the white man 
		that Mr. Muhammad is wrong, don't listen to 
		him. But everything Mr. Muhammad has been 
		saying is going to come to pass is now coming 
		to pass and now the Negro leaders are standing 
		up saying that we are about to have a racial 
		explosion. We're going to have a racial 
		explosion and that's more dangerous than an 
		atomic explosion.
<b> 
</b><b>	ANGLE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		It's going to explode because black people are 
		dissatisfied. They're dissatisfied now not only 
		with the white man, but with these Negroes who 
		have been sitting around here posing as leaders 
		and spokesmen for black people. Anytime you put 
		too many sparks around a powder keg, the thing 
		is going to explode and if the thing that 
		explodes is still inside the house, then the 
		house will be destroyed. So the Honorable 
		Elijah Muhammad is telling the white man get 
		this powder keg out of your house, let the 
		black people in this country separate from him 
		while there's still time. And if the black man 
		is allowed to separate and go on onto some land 
		of his own, where he can solve his problems, 
		then there won't be any explosion. COMPLETE 
<b>		SEPARATION IS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO THE BLACK 
</b><b>		AND WHITE PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY!!!

	Malcolm, trying to touch him. He is the hero of the hour. Sidney, Earl, 
	and Benjamin with him, enjoying the accolades and trying to help 
	Malcolm make his way out. Bembry stands apart, removed and silent.
<b>

</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM'S VOICE
</b>		Okay, last hug.
<b> 
</b>	As he enters, a smile on his face, but the concern of the evening

<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		Why are you looking at me like that?

</b>		Because you're in trouble.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		How do you know?
<b> 
</b>	She smiles.

<b>				BETTY
</b>		Dear heart, because I know you.
<b> 
</b>	A pause.

<b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I don't want to bring my troubles home. You 
		know that.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		I'm not made of glass.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I just want to sit here and be still.

<b>				BETTY
</b>		We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But 
		we're going to have one right now if you don't
		talk about it.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Talk about what?
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		The talk is everywhere!
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		There's always talk, always been talk, and 
		always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm 
		trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting 
		rich off the Nation?
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just 
		talk any more.
<b> 
</b>	She picks up the newspaper and reads from it:
<b> 
</b>				BETTY (contd) 
		"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old 
		leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today 
		faced paternity suits from two former 
		secretaries who charged he fathered their four 
		children..."
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		There are always slanders, always lies. You're 
		reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're 
		trying to bring us down, bring down the 
		Messenger.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had 
		had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 
<b>		1957..."
</b><b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I was going to talk to Bembry about it tonight.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the 
		matter with you?
<b> 
</b>	Betty gets up, goes to him gently.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are 
		you so dedicated that you have blinded 
		yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face 
		the truth? Bembry is the editor of the 
		newspaper you established. Ask him why your 
		name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a 
		year? Ask him why you rate front page in every 
		paper in the country, but not a single sentence 
		in your own.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>			(rationalizing) 
		I'm not interested in personal publicity. Our 
		people know what I'm doing.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so 
		blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah 
		Muhammad saved my life.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		A long time ago. You've repaid them many times 
		over. Ask them why they have new cars and 
		houses full of new furniture.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		What do we have, Malcolm. A broken-down jalopy 
		and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own 
		our own home. What about our children? What 
		about me? You don't even own life insurance.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		The Nation will provide for you and the 
		children if anything happens to me.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are 
		you blind?
<b> 
</b>	She touches him very gently.
<b> 
</b>				BETTY (contd)
		Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising 
		our kids practically by myself, while you're 
		running all over the world. You don't know how 
		many times the girls ask me when is daddy 
		coming home?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY
</b>		We need you too!
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		What do you want me to do?
<b> 
</b><b>				BETTY 
</b>		Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a

<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Because 1964 threatens to be a very explosive 
		year on the racial front, and because I myself 
		intend to be very active in every phase of the 
		American Negro struggle for HUMAN RIGHTS, I 
		have called this press conference, this 
		morning in order to clarify my own position in 
		the struggle -- especially in regards to 
		politics and nonviolence. In the past I thought 
		the thoughts, spoke the words of the Honorable 
		Elijah Muhammad, that day is over. From now on 
		I speak my own words, and think my own thoughts. 
		Internal differences within the Nation of Islam 
		forced me out of it. I did not leave of my own 
		free will. But now that it has happened, I 
		intend to make the most of it. Now that I have 
		more independence of action, I intend to use a 
		more flexible approach toward working with 
		others to get a solution to this problem. I do 
		not pretend to be a divine man, but I do 
		believe in divine guidance, divine power, and 
		in the fulfillment of divine prophecy. I am not 
		educated, nor am I an expert in any particular 
		field, but I am sincere, and my sincerity is my 
		credentials. I'm not out to fight other Negro 
		leaders or organizations. We must find a common 
		solution, to a common problem. I am going to 
		organize and head a new mosque in New York 
		City, known as the Muslim Mosque, Inc. This 
		gives us a religious base, and the spiritual 
		force necessary to rid our people of the vices 
		that destroy the moral fiber of our community. 
		Our political philosophy will be black 
		nationalism. Our economic and social philosophy 
		will be black nationalism. The Muslim Mosque, 
		Inc. will remain wide open for ideas and 
		financial aid from all quarters. Whites can 
		help us, but they can't join us. There can be 
		no black-white unity until there is first some 
		black unity.

	A host of questions fired all at once: How many of Elijah's followers
	will join you? etc, etc, etc.
<b> 
</b>	Malcolm calms them:
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		There is one further preparation I need. It is 
		a return to the source of our great religion. I 
		will make a pilgrimage to Mecca.

		one race. I intend to be careful not to 
		sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty. 
		I'm not a racist and do not subscribe to any of 
		the tenets of racism. In all honesty and

<b> 
</b><b>				REPORTER #1 
</b>		Malcolm, you said on your trip abroad you 
		sensed a feeling of great brotherhood.
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		As I recall, I pointed out that while I was in 
		Mecca making the pilgrimage, I spoke about the 
		brotherhood that existed at all levels among 
		all people, all colors who had accepted the 
		religion of Islam. I pointed out that what it 
		had done, Islam, for those people despite their 
		complexion differences, that it would probably 
		do America well to study the religion of Islam 
		and perhaps it could drive some of the racism 
		from this society. Muslims look upon themselves 
		as human beings, as part of the human family 
		and therefore look upon all other segments of 
		the human family as part of that same family. 
		Today my friends are black, brown, red, yellow 
		and white.
<b> 
</b><b>				REPORTER #8 
</b>		Malcolm, are you prepared to go to the United 
		Nations at this point and ask that charges be 
		brought against the United States for its 
		treatment of the American Negroes?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		Oh yes.

	The AUDIENCE applauds.
<b> 
</b>				MALCOLM (contd) 
		The audience will have to be quiet. Yes, as I 
		pointed out that during my trip that nations, 
		African nations, Asian, Latin nations look very 
		hypocritical when they stand up in the UN 
		condemning South Africa and saying nothing 
		about the racist practices that are manifested 
		everyday against Negroes in this society. I 
		would be not a man if I didn't do so. I 
		wouldn't be a man.

		significance?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		No, not particularly. But I do think that you 
		will And black people in America, as they 
		strive to throw off the shackles of mental 
		colonialism, will also probably reflect an 
		effort to throw off the shackles of cultural 
		colonialism. And then they'll begin to reflect 
		desires of their own with standards of their 
		own.
<b> 
</b><b>                   	REPORTER #2 
</b>		One of your more controversial remarks was a 
		call for black people to get rifles and form 
		rifle clubs sometime back. Do you still favor 
		that for self-defense?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		I don't see why that should be controversial. I 
		think that if white people found themselves 
		victim of the same kind of brutality that black 
		people in this country face, and they saw that 
		the government was either unwilling or unable 
		to protect them, that the intelligence on the 
		part of the whites would make them get some 
		rifles and protect themselves.

<b>

</b>		Mr. X. I have a good heart. I'm a good person

		help the cause of the Negro?
<b> 
</b><b>	CLOSE - MALCOLM
</b><b> 
</b>	He looks at her. He thinks. He speaks.

</b><b> 
</b><b>				BROTHER EARL 
</b>		Brother Minister, what is wrong?
<b> 
</b><b>				MALCOLM 
</b>		The way I feel, I ought not to go out there 
		today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this 
		tension by telling the black man not to fight 
		himself -- that's all a part of the white man's 
		big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst 
		ourselves, against each other. I'm not 
		fighting anyone, that's not what we're here 
		for.

</b><b>200B 	THE STUNNED FACES OF BLACK PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE AUDUBON BALLROOM...
</b><b> 
</b><b>	--AND IN HARLEM.
</b><b> 
</b>	OSSIE DAVIS speaking behind the above:
<b> 
</b><b>				OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE 
</b>		Here at this final hour, in this quiet place, 
		Harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its 
		brightest hopes, extinguished now and gone from 
		us forever.
<b> 
</b>200C 	DOLLY SHOT of the long line of people outside the funeral parlor, 
	waiting to see Malcolm's body, where it lies before burial.
<b> 
</b>				OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE: (contd) 
		For Harlem is where he worked, and where he 
		struggled and fought. His home of homes, where 
		his heart was and where his people are. And it 
		is therefore most fitting that we meet once 
		again in Harlem to share these last moments 
		with him. For Harlem has ever been gracious to 
		those who loved her, have fought for her and 
		defended her honor even to death. It is not in 
		the memory of man that this beleaguered, 
		unfortunate but nonetheless proud community has 
		found a braver, more gallant young champion 
		than this Afro-American who lies before us 
		unconquered still. Many will ask what Harlem 
		finds to honor in this stormy, controversial 
		and bold young captain and we will smile and we 
		will answer and say unto them:
<b> 
</b><b>2OOD  SHOTS - FACES OF HARLEM - PRESENT DAY - THE 90'S
</b><b> 
</b>	Ordinary PEOPLE in ordinary pursuits of life, BLACK PEOPLE still 
	struggling to stay afloat in a racist WHITE AMERICA that does not have 
	their best interests at hand -- 8 years of Reagan and now at least 4 
	years of Bush.
<b> 
</b>				OSSIE DAVIS'S VOICE (contd) 
		Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you 
		have him smile at you? Did you ever listen to 
		him? Did he ever really do a mean thing? Was he 
		ever associated with violence or any public 
		disturbance?

</b><b>200G	SHOT - NEWSREEL FOOTAGE OF THE _REAL_ MALCOLM X
