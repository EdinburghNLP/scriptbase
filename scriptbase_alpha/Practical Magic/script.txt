                        PRACTICAL MAGIC
                        Aunt Frances:(V.O): For more than 200 years 
                          we Owens women have been blamed by everything that's 
                          ever gone wrong in this town.
                        (V.O): Is that why people hate us so much, Aunt Frances?
                         Aunt Frances (V.O): They don't hate us, sweetheart.

                         (V. O): We just make them a little nervous.
                        Aunt Frances (V.O): Let's face it, Jet, We Owens 
                          women have always created a stir. It all began with 
                          your ancestor, Maria.
                         A woman: She was a witch.
                         Aunt Frances (V.O): The first in our family. 
                          And you are the most recent in a long and distinguished 
                          line.

                         (V.O): Is that why they wanted to hang her? Because 
                          she was a witch?
                         (V. O): The fact that she was a bit of a heartbreaker 
                          didn't help. Nor did it help that most of her lovers 
                          had wives on the hanging committee.
                         Aunt Frances (V.O): But no, I didn't think 
                          it was either of those reasons. They feared her because 
                          she had a gift a power that has been passed on to you 
                          children. She had the gift of magic. And it was this 
                          very gift that saved her life. She was vanished to this 
                          very island. With her unborn child growing inside her 
                          belly. She waited for her lover to rescue her. But he 
                          never came. No one came. In a moment of despair, she 
                          cat a spell upon herself that she would never again 
                          feel the agony of love. But as her bitterness grew the 
                          spell turned into a curse. A curse on any man who dared 
                          love an Owens woman.
                        ===== EXT. BEACH DAY=====

                          
                        (V. O): Is that why Daddy died? From the curse?
                        
                        Aunt Frances (V.O): Yes, my darling.
                         Aunt Frances (V.O): Your mother knew She heard 
                          the beetles ticking for your father's death all day 
                          long. She knew that when you hear the sound of the deathwatch 
                          beetle the man you love is doomed to die.

                        ===== EXT. HOUSE =====
                          
                        Aunt Frances (V.O): That's how you came to live 
                          with us. You tucked you into our lives then. We've raised 
                          you the best way we know how.
                        
                        Aunt Jet (V.O): In this house we have chocolate 
                          cake for breakfast. We never bother with silly things 
                          like bedtimes or brushing our teeth.

                        
                        Aunt Frances (V.O): But with the sweets comes 
                          the sour.
                        
                        Aunt Jet (V.O): So when you find yourself the 
                          center of attention
                        Young Gillian: Hi! You want to play?

                        Aunt Jet (V.O): It's not that they hate you. 
                          It's that, well... We're different.
                        Girls: You witch! Witch, witch! You're a bitch!
                        === EXT. GARDEN ===
                          
                        Aunt Jet: Gillian, Sally. The only curse in 
                          this family is sitting there at the end of the table. 
                          Your Aunt Fanny.

                        
                        Aunt Jet: Oh come on. You have to admit that 
                          any man who gets involved with an Owens woman is bound 
                          to end up 6 feet under.
                        
                        Aunt Jet: Spare me.
                        
                        Aunt Frances: What about my poor Ethan?

                        
                        Aunt Jet: Fate.
                        
                        Aunt Frances: Accident.
                        
                        Young Sally: Mommy died of a broken heart, didn't 
                          she?

                        
                        Aunt Frances: Yes, my darling girl, she did.
                        
                        Aunt Jet: My little witch. Let's go inside and 
                          do some spells.
                        
                        Young Sally: What about my homework?

                        
                        Aunt Jet: Pish! Tosh! You'll both learn things 
                          in the house. Let's go.
                        
                        Young Sally: Come on Gilly.
                        
                        Young Gillian: I'm coming, Sally.

                        === INT. KITCHEN ===
                           
                        Aunt Jet: Very good, Sally. You've been blessed 
                          with a gift.
                        
                        Young Gillian: What about me?
                        

                        Aunt Frances: We don't worry about you, Gilly- 
                          Bean. Your talents will emerge in time.
                        === KNOCKING ON THE DOOR ===
                          
                        Aunt Jet: Sally, you just stay right there. 
                          Keep working on your spells. Just keep working on your 
                          spells.
                        Aunt Jet: Get the bird.

                        
                        Aunt Frances: Get the book.
                        A woman: I want him so much, I can't think about 
                          anything else. I don't sleep. He has to leave his wife. 
                          He has to leave her now.
                        
                        Aunt Jet: Perhaps you might find one better 
                          suited.
                        

                        A woman: I don't want anyone else. He's all 
                          I think about. Why the hell else would I come here?
                        
                        Aunt Frances: Take the money, Jet.
                         A woman: I want him to want me so much he can't 
                          stand it.
                        

                        Aunt Jet: Be careful what you wish for.
                        === INT. STAIRS ===
                        Young Sally: I hope I never fall in love. I 
                          hope I never fall in love.
                        
                        Young Gillian: I can't wait to fall in love.

                        === INT. ROOM===
                          
                        Young Sally: " He will hear my call a mile 
                          away. He will whistle my favorite song. He can ride 
                          a pony backwards."
                        
                        Young Gillian: What are you doing?

                        
                        Young Sally: Summoning up a true love spell. 
                          called Amas Veritas. " He can flip pancakes in 
                          the air. He'll be marvelously kind. And his favorite 
                          shape will be a star. And he'll have one green eye and 
                          one blue."
                        
                        Young Gillian: Thought you never wanted to fall 
                          in love.
                        
                        Young Sally: That's the point. The guy I dreamed 
                          of doesn't exist. And if he doesn't exist, I'll never 
                          die of a broken heart. And if he doesn't exist, I'll 
                          never die of a broken heart.

                        === INT ROOM NIGHT===
                           
                        Gillian: Get the door. Sal, you have no idea.
                        
                        Sally: Do you love him enough to marry him?
                        

                        Gillian: Oh, come on, Sal, What's enough? I 
                          hate it here. I want to go where no one's even heard 
                          of us.
                        
                        Sally: I feel like I'll never see you again.
                        
                        Gillian: Of course you will. You can see me 
                          again. We'll grow old together. It'll be you and me 
                          living in a big house. These 2 old biddies with all 
                          these cats. I bet we even die on the same day.
                        

                        Sally: You swear?
                        
                        Gillian: (to her boyfriend) Honey! I need your 
                          pocketknife. (to Sally) Here. My blood. Your blood. 
                          Our blood.
                        === EXT. POST OFFICE ===
                           
                        Aunt Frances: Good morning. Hello, boys. Charlie! 
                          Looking good! God, what was I thinking? Oh, Franny, 
                          let it go.

                        
                        Aunt Jet: Oh My goodness, Gillian's in Orlando! 
                          (to Sally) She's in Orlando!
                        
                        Aunt Frances: I guess the Roto-Rooter man's 
                          history.
                        
                        Aunt Jet: Well, according to that.

                        
                        Sally: This is insane. She keeps going through 
                          all these guys.
                        
                        Aunt Frances: Hopefully, someday she'l find 
                          a guy who'll go through her.
                        Aunt Jet: Hello, darling, How are you?
                        

                        Aunt Frances: Oh, Jet, just give it up.
                        
                        Aunt Jet: Never.
                        
                        Sally: God, I miss her.
                        

                        Aunt Jet: Oh, sweetie! Oh, dear.
                        
                        Aunt Frances: Oh, Samson! Now, just knock it 
                          off.
                        
                        Sally: All I want is a normal life.
                        

                        Aunt Frances: My darling girl, when are you 
                          going to understand that "normal" is not necessarily 
                          a virtue? It rather denotes a lack of courage.
                        
                        Sally: Well, it's what I want.
                        
                        Aunt Jet: See this couple? He's having an affair 
                          with the babysitter. And she can eat a cake in under 
                          a minute.

                        ===EXT. GARDEN ===
                           
                        Aunt Jet: What time is it?
                        
                        Aunt Frances: Any moment now. (to Sally) Where 
                          are you going, dear?
                        

                        Aunt Jet: Most excellent.
                        Sally (VO): Dear Gillian, Today is our third 
                          anniversary and all I have to show for it are 2 beautiful 
                          little girls and a husband I just can't stop kissing. 
                          I don't even mind the beard. I wish you could see us. 
                          No more stones being thrown, no taunts cried out. Everything 
                          is just so blissfully normal. Life is perfect. Dear 
                          Sal:
                        === EXT. SWIMMING POOL ===
                        Gillian (V.O.) I'm lying in the sun. I'm hanging 
                          by the pool. I've got a million friends. You might say 
                          that life is perfect. But I don't care about any of 
                          it. In fact, I only have 2 words to say to you: Jimmy

                          because I loved him so much!
                        Aunt Frances: My poor little girl. We had no 
                          idea when we cast the spell.

                          Oh, You didn't. Please tell me that my own flesh and

                          so much to be happy.
                        
                        Aunt Frances: We never expected that you'd truly 
                          love him.

                          brought him into my life. You bring him back! I have 
                          never asked you for anything ! I never asked for spells, 
                          but do this! You can bring him back.

                          it wouldn't be Michael. It'd be something else. Something 
                          dark and unnatural.
                        
                        Sally: I don't care what he comes back as. As

                          I'm worried about Antonia. Do you know she puts on her

                          were going to open a botanical shop. Michael'd get the 
                          ingredients. And I'd make the stuff. He really loved 
                          my mint-oatmeal shaving cream. He couldn't stop eating 
                          it. I'm sure all this is really boring to you. But he 
                          really made me lough.
                        

                        Sally: Angelov? What kind of name is that?

                        Sally: Bulgarian?
                        

                        Gillian: Huh, huh. He's from somewhere near 
                          Transylvania. He has this whole Dracula-cowboy thing 
                          about him. He's just so intense. I mean, he talks about 
                          our rerationship in terms of centuries. Sometimes we 
                          just stay up all night worshipping each other like bats. 
                          Thank God for Jet's belladonna or I'd never get any 
                          sleep.
                        
                        Sally: Why are you taking that stuff?
                        
                        Gillian: I'm not using it. I just give it to 
                          him every now and then. That's all.
                        

                        Sally: So you're drugging your boyfriend to 
                          get a little shut-eye? Doesn't that seem strange to 
                          you?
                        
                        Gillian: Maybe. And he's strong. So much stronger 
                          than me. He can survive the curse. Do you forgive our 
                          mother?
                        
                        Sally: Sometimes.
                        

                        Gillian: You'll never forgive yourself unless 
                          you get up and you get dressed and brush your teeth, 
                          because your breath stinks and you take care of those 
                          little girls.
                        
                        Sally: Yeah. You're right.

                        Sally (V.O.) Dearest, Gilly. Sometimes I feel 
                          there's a hole inside me an emptiness that, at times 
                          seems to burn. I think if you lifted my heart to your 
                          ear, probably you could hear the ocean. And the moon 
                          tonight, there's a circle around it. A sign of trouble 
                          not far behind. I have this dream of being whole. Of 
                          not going to sleep each night, wanting. But still, sometimes 
                          when the wind is warm or the crickets sing I dream of 
                          a love that even time will lie down and be still for. 
                          I just want someone to love me. I want to be seen. I 
                          don't know. Maybe I've had my happiness. I don't want 
                          to believe it but there is no man, Gilly only that moon.

                        Sally: Why can't you two just stay here? 
                        Aunt Frances: We can't back out. We're on the 
                          committee. We are presenting.

                        
                        Sally: Fine. But I don't want them dancing naked 
                          under the full moon. 
                        Aunt Jet: No, of course not, dear. Nudity is 
                          entirely optional, as you well remember!

                        Sally: Let's get you out of here.
                        
                        Gillian: I'm fine.
                        
                        Gillian: He's been really crazy, you know? We've 
                          been driving for 2 weeks straight. I mean, not even 
                          straight. In these zigzags, back and forth. Damn these 
                          shose! Then today he says he wants a jelly doughnut. 
                          An he says to the kid, "Jelly doughnut, with cream." 
                          And the kid looked confused. And I said, "Jimmy, 
                          jelly's not a cream." And then the kid laughed 
                          and I laughed and then he punched me. He punched me 
                          real hard. The bastard! Blood on the moon!

                        
                        Sally: I know.
                        
                        Gillian: Blood on the moon!
                        
                        Sally: I know. Get in the car.

                        
                        Gillian: Where's my tiger's eye? It brings me 
                          luck. I left it. I got to get my tiger's eye!
                        
                        Sally: It's probably in the bag, Gilly! Gillian, 
                          come on!

                        Jimmy: You drive.
                        
                        Jimmy: You want some? Nope. Hey, Sally, you 
                          ever read any books by Louis L'Amour? Okay, Louis L'Amour 
                          is a foreigner and he loved all things cowboy. Just 
                          like me, Jimmy-boy. So Louis would write stories about 
                          rustlers. Rustlers who were really bad guys.
                        
                        Gillian: (To Sally)The belladonna is in my bag.
                        

                        Jimmy: They would try to steal the cattle. But 
                          before they could sell them they would try to take away 
                          the brand of the owner with an acid, or by scrubbing. 
                          Unfortunately, they could never get rid of it. So they 
                          would be caught and get hanged.
                        
                        Sally: What are you doing?
                        
                        Jimmy: Come on! You can't hide the brand. It's 
                          just you and me. (To Sally) Watch the road!
                        

                        Sally: Shut up! Rustlers and branding! Louis 
                          L'Amour by the way is not a foreigner! He's from Noth 
                          Dakota, you asshole! Jimmy: Watch the road!
                        
                        Sally: You're freaking ne out, Dracula freak! 
                          Give me the bottle before I plow you into a truck just 
                          to get you to shut up!
                        
                        Jimmy: Calm down! You know, girls. I'm feeling 
                          very into sisters right now.

                        Sally: I gave him plenty.

                          I love you.

                          I'll be good. I'll have babies.
                        
                        Sally: I have babies, Gillian. I had normal. 
                          And I worked really hard to get that normal.
                        
                        Gillian: It's all my fault, Sally. I didn't 
                          mean to ruin your life. I just had no one else to turn 
                          to.
                        

                        Sally: Get in the car. Get in the car. We have 
                          to go to the police. It was self-defense.
                        
                        Gillian: The old slowly-poison-him-to-death 
                          self-defense? Come on, Sally, they're never going to 
                          believe us.
                        
                        Sally: You really should stop smoking so much.
                        

                        Gillian: Why?
                        
                        Sally: I'll probably get life. I should smoke 
                          two at once. It'll shorten the sentence. I really don't 
                          want to lose my children.

                        Gillian: When Muchael died, you asked the aunts 
                          to bring him back.
                        
                        Sally: But they wouldn't.
                        

                        Gillian: Wouldn't. but couldn't.
                        
                        Sally: No, They were right. He'd come back as 
                          something dark and unnatural.
                        
                        Gillian: Jimmy already is dark and unnatural. 
                          I don't care what he comes back as.
                        

                        Sally: No, that is not an option. That is not 
                          a choice.

                          exactly call him my boyfriend. He's more like a bug 
                          mistake.

                          really see something. We all jump off the roof and fly. 
                          We kill our husband too. Or is that outside your jurisdiction?

                          this all sounds to me? I got people telling me you're 
                          here cooking up placenta bars you're into devil worship.

                          soaps and hand lotions and shampoo. And the aunts .. 
                          they like to meddle in people's love lives. Magic isn't 
                          just spells and potions. Your badge , it's just a star, 
                          Just another symble. Your talisman. It can't stop ciminals 
                          in their tracks, can it? It has power because you believe

                          I took his life. I'll tell you all need to know. I'll 
                          tell you how I did it, where I buried him, what I did 
                          it with. I'll tell you how

                          second, all right? One step at a time. I took on oath 
                          to uphold the law. I came here to bring in the bad guy 
                          because generally that's what I do. You asked me how 
                          many times I read your letter. I must've read it about 
                          a thousand times. I know now, It was your letter anything 
                          else that brought me here. It was you. And I'm all mixed-up 
                          about that.
                        
                        Sally: The reason you're here and you don't 
                          know why is because I sent for you. When I was a little 
                          girl, I worked a spell so I would never fall in love. 
                          I asked for qualities in a man that I knew couldn't 
                          possibly exist.

                          is just one of your spells? 
                        Sally: Yeah. It's not real. And if you stay, 
                          I wouldn't know if it was because of the spell and you 
                          wouldn't know if it was because I didn't want to go 
                          to prison.
                        
                        Gary Hallet: You know, all relationships have 
                          problem.

                        
                        Sally: I'm right, aren't I? You don't know,

                          here!

                        
                        Woman F: It's in the kitchen!
                        
                        Antonia: In the side door!
                        ===INT. KITCHEN NIGHT===
                           

                        Aunt Jet: Come in! It's so good of you to come. 
                          No, now's not time to be shy. Come on in. Grab yourselves 
                          a spoon. You can stir right over there.
                        Aunt Frances: You get right over here and grab 
                          that spoon and dig right in. Doesn't that look great? 
                          And the fumes are great for the pores. Not to mention 
                          sealing his nasty spirit back into the grave. 
                        Woman A: Once, I was across town, my daughter 
                          had a nightmare. I swear, I could hear her crying.
                        
                        Aunt Jet:There's a little witch in all of us.

                        
                        Sally: Everything's almost ready, Aunt Jet. 
                          (to Sara) I didn't expect to see you here.
                        
                        Sara: Ever since I was a girl, I've wanted to 
                          see inside your house.
                        
                        Sally: Thank you for coming.

                        
                        Woman F: Is this okay? It's all I had.
                        
                        Aunt Frances: Well, ladies, let's begin.
                        ===INT. ROOM NIGHT===
                           

                        Aunt Frances: All right, ladies, pick a broom 
                          from a circle.
                        
                        Woman A: Holy shit!
                        
                        Woman B: I've been strung out by a guy before, 
                          but this
                        

                        Aunt Jet: Would each of you pick up your brooms? 
                          Hold them at staff length, handle to brush. Remember 
                          that as we go forth. It is only with our hearts beating 
                          as one that we can save the life of this child.
                        (Aunt Frances starts spelling)
                        
                        Woman C: Are we supposed to say this?
                        (Everyone spells to get rid of James's spirit from 
                          Gillian)
                         Sally: Stop it! We're killing her.

                        
                        Gillian (James): Fight this, you bitch!
                        
                        Sally: Oh, God! Oh, God! Gilly! Gilly, Honey!
                        
                        Gillian: It's okay. I love you.

                        
                        Sally: Stay with me.
                        
                        Gillian: Please, just let him take me.
                        
                        Sally: No, you have to hold on. Gill, you have 
                          to stay with me. Gilly, No, stay with me. Gilly, No, 
                          stay with me.

                        
                        Gillian: No, he wants me. Just me. Everyone 
                          will be safe. Just let him take me.
                        
                        Sally: Don't die on me, Gilly Owens, please. 
                          Because we're supposed to die together, remember? The 
                          same time. You promised me that. And this is not that 
                          day.
                        
                        Gillian: I love you, Sally.

                         Sally: Okay, wait. I've got it. Get them back 
                          in a circle.
                        Sally: Hey, Jimmy, I got a worm with your name 
                          on it. You thirsty? Is this is what you want? Well, 
                          this ...you can't have. My blood. Your blood. Our blood.
                        
                        Aunt Frances: Maria's blood. Now! Push her in.
                        

                        Sally: I love you, Gillian.
                        Woman A: We did it.
                        
                        Aunt Frances: Hands up. ladies. Ashes to ashes, 
                          dust to dust.
                        
                        Woman C: I wonder if that would work on my ex-husband?

                        
                        Woman A: Come on, ladies, let's clean house!
                        
                        Sally: Through kitchen. Follow me.
                        
                        Woman A: Well done.

                        
                        Sally: Sweep him to the roses.
                        ===EXT. GARDEN DAY===
                           
                        Gillian: Hey! There's something for you.
                        

                        Sally: From Arizona.
                        
                        Sally (V.O.): "Dear Miss Owens: Any further 
                          investigations. Office hereby concluded James Angelvo's 
                          cause of death was accidental. Jewely in ashes of structure 
                          provided positive indentification. Sincerely, Gary Hallet 
                          special investigator."
                        
                        Gillian: I don't think he's in there, Sal.

                        
                        Sally: What would you do, Gilly?
                        Gillian: What wouldn't I do for the right guy?
                        (Gary Hallet comes and kisses Sally.)
                        ===EXT. HOUSE HELOWEEN NIGHT===
                        Sally (V.O.): Can love travel back in time and 
                          heal a broken heart? Was it our joined hands that finally 
                          lifted Maria's curse? I'd like to think so. There're 
                          some things I know for certain. Always throw spilled 
                          salt over your left shoulder. Keep rosemary by your 
                          garden gate. Plant lavender for luck. And fall in love 
                          whenever you can.

                        THE HAPPY END...
