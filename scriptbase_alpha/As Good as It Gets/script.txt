FADE IN:

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT

ANGLE ON apartment doorway. As it opens and an
enormously SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up
against the cold -- turning back to call inside to the
unseen love of her long life.

          SWEET-FACED WOMAN
     I'm just going to get some
     flowers, dear. I'll be back in
     twenty minutes. It's tulip season
     today. I'm so happy.

And now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness
dissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that
quickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her
apartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated.

POV - MELVIN UDALL

in the hallway... Well past 50... unliked, unloved,
unsettling. A huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever
met. Right now all his considerable talent and strength
is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the
elevator door he holds open.

          MELVIN
     Come here, sweetheart... come on.

ON DOG

Sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting.
Melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the
mutt who has ignores him.

          MELVIN
     Wanna go for a ride? Okay,
     sweetie?

The dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges
and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog
urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG
sensing a kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK.

          MELVIN
       (a malevolent tone)
     You've pissed your last floor, you
     dog-eared monkey.

The dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much
meaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout
shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the
garbage chute.

          MELVIN
     I'll bet you wish you were some
     sort of real dog now, huh? Don't
     worry...  this is New York. If you
     can make it here, you can make it
     anywhere, you know? You ugly,
     smelly fuck.

And with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and
lets go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING "ANOOOOS"
from the DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment
door opens emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON
NYE, early 30s. Simon has been born and raised with
Gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of
trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT

Frantic... he bolts into the hall... Melvin is just about
to enter his apartment.

          SIMON
     Verdell!?!! Here, good doggie...

He notices Melvin at the far end of the hall.

          SIMON
     Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey
     there!
       (as Melvin turns)
     Have you seen Verdell?

          MELVIN
     What's he look like?

Melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is
directly opposite Simon's.

          SIMON
     My dog... you know... I mean my
     little dog with the adorable
     face... Don't you know what my dog
     looks like?

          MELVIN
     I got it. You're talking about
     your dog. I thought that was the
     name of the colored man I've been
     seeing in the hall.

Simon looks O.S. -- and sees his black friend.

          SIMON
     Which color was that?

          MELVIN
     Like thick molasses, with one of
     those wide noses perfect for
     smelling trouble and prison
     food...

Simon has had it.

          SIMON
     Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.

          MELVIN
       (not missing a beat)
     How're you doing?

          SIMON
     Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I
     think you know that.

          FRANK
       (overlapping)
     Simon, you've got to get dressed.

          MELVIN
       (to Simon)
     What I know is that as long as you
     keep your work zipped up around
     me, I don't give a fuck what or
     where you shove your show. Are we
     being neighbors for now?

          SIMON
       (to Frank)
     Do you still think I was
     exaggerating?

FRANK can only smile.

          FRANK
     Definitely a package you don't
     want to open or touch.

          MELVIN
     Hope you find him. I love that
     dog.

Simon, terminally non-confrontational, still finds
himself compelled to turn back toward Melvin.

          SIMON
       (directly)
     You don't love anything, Mr.
     Udall.

Simon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the
hallway.

          MELVIN
     I love throwing your dog down the
     garbage chute.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

Melvin locks and unlocks and locks his door, counting to
five with each lock. He turns the lights quickly on and
off and on five times and makes a straight-line towards
his bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens
the medicine chest.

INT. MEDICINE CHEST

Scores of neatly stacked Neutrogena soaps. He unwraps
one -- begins to wash -- discards it -- goes through the
process two more times.

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

A group of PARTY GOERS enters -- followed by a HANDYMAN
holding Verdell who looks and finds:

SIMON

who looks up -- lights up -- and tears up as he moves
quickly toward the group and his dog.

          SIMON
     Thank the good Lord... wow... my
     honey... where have you been?

          PARTY GOER
       (thinking the greeting's
          for him)
     He always liked me.

As Simon goes past him to take the dog from the
Handyman... JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a
laugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As
the others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside.
Jackie lingers, looking on affectionately as Simon picks
some awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body... he puts
Verdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS
in protest.

          SIMON
     Just for a second, okay?

The DOG YAPS "no." Simon, delighted, picks him up again.

          SIMON
       (kissing him on the mouth)
     Look at him...  where was little
     baby?

          HANDYMAN
       (smiling)
     In the basement garbage bin eating
     diaper shit.

Simon reacts -- then notices the Handyman, tongue in
cheek, trying to suppress his amusement.

          SIMON
     Go ahead, John, you earned your fun.
       (looking at Verdell)
     How did he get down in the
     basement? I mean even if he got
     on the elevator how... ?

          HANDYMAN
     Maybe some nice neighbor shoved
     him down the garbage chute.

          SIMON
     My God! No!

He stares out... Frank frustrated following.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - NIGHT

Quiet -- safe -- just Melvin's voice reading aloud as he
writes.

          MELVIN
     'Somewhat in the dark, she had
     confessed and he had forgiven.
     This is what you live for, he
     said. Two heads on a pillow where
     there is only the safety of being
     with each other. How, she
     wondered, could she find such hope
     in the most shameful part of her.'

He barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads.

          SIMON (O.S.)
     Mr. Udall.

But Melvin's into it. His fingers flying as he reads.

          MELVIN
     'At last she was able to define
     love. Love was... '

More KNOCKING.

          SIMON (O.S.)
     Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you
     please.

          MELVIN
     'Love was... '

He almost has the rest of the sentence -- the meaning of
love -- but the knocking throws him.

          MELVIN
     ... Son-of-a-bitch-pansy-assed-
     stool-pusher.

He burst from his chair.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - NIGHT

As Simon hears MELVIN through the door and takes a step
back. Melvin throws open the door. He looks demonic.

          MELVIN
       (loud and angry)
     Yeeeess!!!

          SIMON
     Maybe this can wait.

Frank signals encouragement as Melvin opens the door.

          SIMON
     I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

          MELVIN
     Well, that's a load off.

Melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to
close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery.

          SIMON
     Did you... do something to him?

          MELVIN
     Do you realize that I work at
     him?

          SIMON
       (eyes downcast)
     No, I didn't.

          MELVIN
     Do you like to be interrupt when
     you are danging around in your
     little garden?

          SIMON
     No...  actually, I even shut the
     phone off and put a little piece
     of cardboard in the ringer so no
     one can just buzz me from d...

          MELVIN
     Well, I work all the time. So
     never, never again interrupt me.
     Okay? I mean, never. Not 30
     years from now... not if there's
     fire. Not even if you hear a thud
     from inside my home and a week
     later there's a smell from in
     there that can only come from a
     decaying body and you have to hold
     a hanky against your face because
     the stench is so thick you think
     you're going to faint even then
     don't come knocking or, if it's
     election night and you're excited
     and want to celebrate because some
     fudge-packer you dated has been
     elected the first queer President
     of the United States... and he's
     going to put you up in Camp David
     and you just want to share the
     moment with someone...  don't knock
     ...  not on this door. Not for
     anything. Got me. Sweetheart?

          SIMON
     Yes. It's not a subtle point
     you're making.

          MELVIN
     Okay, then.

Melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut.

          SIMON
     So the theory of confrontations is
     that now he'll think twice before
     messing with me?

Frank smiles affectionately. Simon turns serious.

          SIMON
     He's genuinely upsetting, isn't
     he?

          FRANK
     Won't worry about it. You go
     ahead.

Frank waits till Simon EXITS SCENE and then knocks loudly
on Melvin's door. There is a sharp change in his demeanor.

          MELVIN (O.S.)
     Oh, I'm pissed!! Now I am really
     pissed!!!

Frank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open.
Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him
forward...  Melvin is scared. Operating on survival mode.

          MELVIN
     No touch. No touch. No touch.

          FRANK
     You may think you can intimidate
     the whole world with your
     attitude, but I grew up in Hell.
     My grandmother had more attitude.
     You don't intimidate me.

          MELVIN
       (calling)
     Police! Police! Fucking crooked
     police...  doughnut-munching morons
     help me!
       (to Frank)
     Assault and battery and you're
     black.

          FRANK
     Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like
     him enough to batter you
     unrecognizable if you verbally
     abuse him or so much as touch his
     dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try
     and think how you can make this up
     to him.
       (suddenly loud)
     I hate doing this. I'm an art
     dealer.
       (beat)
     Have a nice day. Party!

He tosses Melvin back and walks out. Melvin straightens
his shirt as he steps out into the hall. Frank smiles as
he re-enters the other apartment. Melvin appears
impressed.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET NEAR CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

A crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin. His
walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the
danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear.
At times he places his palms together and extends his
arms cutting a path through people. We will be very
pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks.

CLOSER ON MELVIN

His eyes focused on the terrain.

INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

ANGLE ON WAITRESS

CAROL CONNELLY talks with another MOTHER -- a customer.
You would not guess it, but her working hours tend to be
the most carefree time of the day. She is telling a
story about her son for the umpteenth time.

          CAROL
       (to the Mother's
          little girl)
     Look at you, you're all better.

          MOTHER
     It's that new medication.

          CAROL
     You know all my son's stuff,
     right?

The Mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but
Carol interrupts her.

          CAROL
     No, no, no, I got a date tonight.
     I'm walking out the door this
     morning and he says to me, 'Mom,
     I promise not to get one of my
     fevers or coughs during your
     date.'

          MOTHER
     Isn't that sweet.

          CAROL
     Little blonde angle.
       (to child,
          affectionately)
     Eat everything.

Melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a
table towards the back and is obviously surprised to find
a MAN and WOMAN sitting at the table.

          WOMAN
     It just came out of me. I said
     you love me the way a remote
     control loves a TV. As long as I
     switch every time...

          HER MALE COMPANION
     Wonderful.

          MELVIN
     People who talk in metaphors can
     shampoo my crotch.
       (on their look)
     Eat up.

They turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the
waitress station where two waitresses, LISA and CAROL,
are talking.

          LISA
     Pay me back next week.

          CAROL
     I owe you. I told you today...
     them's the rules. Oh, excuse me,
     Melvin.

She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out
of the way. He gulps at the contact (since no one else
ever touches him) but covers his self-consciousness.

          MELVIN
     I'm starving.

          CAROL
       (firmly to Lisa)
     Will you please take it?

Melvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with
stealth, so that she must touch him again to get him out
of the way...

          LISA
     This way you take a cab home so
     you have time to get ready for the
     date.

          CAROL
     "Ready" is not my problem.

She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could
read Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the
date talk. To Carol he is as harmless as furniture.

          CAROL
       (to Melvin)
     Go sit down. You know you're not
     allowed back here...  Spencer's
     more excited about it than I am...
     He says, "Mom, I promise not to
     get a fever or couch during your date."

The other WAITRESSES and the SHORT ORDER COOK all go
"awww."

          CAROL
     I know. He's just the best.

          MELVIN
     I've got Jews at my table.

          CAROL
     It's not your table. It's the
     place's table. Behave. This
     once, you can sit at someone
     else's station.

The two waitresses signal their protests.

          CAROL
     Or you can just wait your turn...

Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper...  he hangs
near their table...  his discomfort builds in this limbo...
then:

          MELVIN
     How much more you got to eat?
     Your appetite isn't as big as
     your noses, is it?

          WOMAN
     What?!!

          MAN
       (to Woman)
     Let's go --

The Woman starts to protest.

          MAN
     Let's leave. We're going.

Melvin sits down at the table -- and takes from his
pocket a plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed.
As he opens his utensils.

          CAROL
     Bryan says he doesn't care how
     long you've been coming you ever
     act like this again you're barred
     for life. I'm gonna miss the
     excitement, but I'll handle it.

There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some
ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only
one in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear
the table.

          MELVIN
     The table's fine if it had some
     cholesterol on it. Two sausages,
     six bacon strips, fries, three
     eggs over easy and coffee.

          CAROL
     You're gonna die soon with that
     diet, you know that?

          MELVIN
     We're all gonna die soon. I will.
     You will. It sure sounds like
     your son will.

ON CAROL

Stunned. Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her
perfect guard and momentarily devastated her. Melvin
senses that he's gone way too far. He wipes his knife.

          CAROL
     If you ever mention my son again,
     you will never be able to eat here
     again. Do you understand? Give me
     some sign you understand or leave
     now. Do you understand me...
       (adds truthful label)
     you crazy freak? Do you?!?

A beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing
down.

          CAROL
     Okay. I'll get your order.

She walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower
lip. He takes some napkins and cleans the table himself.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room
sofa. He is expertly into foreplay. She begins to make
noises as she responds...  each time startling herself
with her own noise and trying to reign it in.

She's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway
-- the other -- functional mom so blown away by the
emergence of this sexy self that she laughs. The Young
Man stops and looks at her.

          YOUNG MAN
     What?

          CAROL
     I...  I...  I don't know...  You got
     me.

His eyes try to burn into hers... She is getting excited
but doesn't know how to play it...  He pushes one of the
fingers of the hand caressing her face toward her
mouth...  She closes her teeth, his fingers attempt
opening her mouth. She stops him.

          CAROL
     Let me just do whatever I do by
     myself...  I'll catch up to you
     someplace I promise.
       (as he's put off)
     Oh, no...  don't look like that.
     No. I'm sorry if I'm a goof.

And so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed
the sex into something more intimate -- and, talk about
egg in your beer, hotter. Things are getting wild when
we hear from the distance a child, SPENCER, CALLING and
COUGHING.

          CAROL
     Kissing...  kissing boys. Oh my.

Carol pulls her head away -- as Spencer's call continues.

          SPENCER (O.S.)
       (softly)
     Grandma, grandma...

          YOUNG MAN
     Maybe you better check.

          CAROL
     Like what did you think I was
     going to do?

INT. HALLWAY/BEVERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway...
she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her
mother, BEVERLY, is listening to music on headphones...
she takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the
cough.

          BEVERLY
     I'm sorry. I was hearing just
     everything you were doing so I put
     these on to give you privacy.

Carol now goes into her son's room.

INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - NIGHT

The room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights...
two drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer
(breathing contraption) a waste basket...  a night stand
filled with medicine, a blood pressure kit...  along with
some stacks of seven-year-old toys and a small TV wedged
into the tiny space.

          SPENCER
     I'm sorry.

          CAROL
     Don't be silly. How bad?

          SPENCER
     Not bad.

Carol feels his head...  that's okay. Then he coughs --
trying to suppress it...  then a bigger cough...  they each
know what that signals...  She brings up a waste basket as
he throws up...  she comforts him. He apologizes. She
loves him.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

As she re-enters. He is taking a cigarette from a pack.

          CAROL
       (a bit panicked)
     You can't smoke...  He can't take
     smoke.

He palms the cigarette -- resumes making out -- his hand
squeezes her breast -- then he stops and looks at his
hand. She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he
picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking
at her with extreme distaste...  She barks a laugh to
cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth.

          CAROL
     Oh, God...  I don't even notice
     anymore.

She crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel. Tries to make
light.

          CAROL
     That'll teach you.

          YOUNG MAN
     Don't apologize.

          CAROL
       (perturbed)
     That wasn't an apology.

She notices his demeanor -- how he avoids looking at her --
how uncomfortable he is.

          CAROL
     Hey...  this is just a little throw-
     up -- it's nothing to be so
     embarrassed about. Really.
       (as he shifts
          uncomfortably)
     Thanks for the dinner. Let me
     write down which trains you take
     to get back.

          YOUNG MAN
     No way.

She brightens.

          YOUNG MAN
     I'll take a cab.

She deflates as he moves past her.

          YOUNG MAN
     Too much reality for a Friday
     night.

EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT

A cold night in hell. Three young men bullshit near the
approach to the tunnel. Their names are VINCENT, EVAN
and DOUG, who is the oldest at 28. Vincent is dopey and
the most likeable of the gritty little trio.

          EVAN
     Why is every customer surprised I
     read books?

          DOUG
       (amazed)
     You read books?

          EVAN
     Oh, wow! I know this guy! Look!
     He even bought me dinner.

They all focus on a black BMW as it slows and stops in
front of them. CARL checks them out carefully through
the front window. He is talking on the speaker phone.

          CARL
       (slightly exasperated)
     Look, I just can't. I promised
     Simon I'd find him a model.

          FRIEND (V.O.)
       (on speaker phone,
          flirting)
     Carl, take me off the speaker.
     Did I tell you that these are
     house seats? C'mon, you could use
     a break. Hello...  Carl, are you
     there...  hello?

Seeing the hustlers:

          CARL
.                ...  I just found a model.

          DOUG
       (to Carl)
     Hey, how it's goin'...

          EVAN
     Hey, hi...  remember?

          CARL
     I only need one.

          EVAN
     You picked me up, maybe a few
     weeks, I don't know, some time
     ago. You were very flattering
     about our...  encounter.

          CARL
     Maybe just you and me...  but this
     is for a painting. I need a
     pretty face.

Carl beckons to Vincent who joins him, trying to conceal
his pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest.

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

There is a KNOCK at the door -- Simon crosses to answer.
He is more relaxed than we've seen him -- a man at peace
humming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who
scratches at the door. Simon opens the door to Vincent.

          SIMON
     Sorry, I was out in the studio
     doing some work and I forgot about
     our appointment.

He leads the way back toward the studio -- chatting away
-- unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him
and eyeing the expensive apartment.

          SIMON
     I usually make such a big deal out
     of picking models but Carl's so
     thorough. I'll bet he drove you
     nuts checking your references.

And he turns and sees the naked model.

          SIMON
       (taken aback)
     This isn't a nude.

Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes.

          VINCENT
     Just kidding around.
       (then mutters)
     So much for love.

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO (MINUTES LATER)

Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the
increasingly uneasy Simon.

          SIMON
     Exactly what is your previous
     experience?

          VINCENT
     How about that pose?
       (sing-song)
     This is not fun...
       (then)
     Give me some direction.

Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive. He
tries not to show it.

          SIMON
     Nothing. I just watch till
     something strikes me. Do anything
     you think of -- try different
     thing. Until I say, "hold that
     pose." Then just try and
     comfortably hold it.

          VINCENT
       (trying another space)
     The fact that you haven't said,
     "hold it" means I haven't done it
     right...  is that correct? I
     haven't done it right?

          SIMON
     No...  Okay. What I do is watch
     and wait for, um... You ever watch
     someone who doesn't know you're
     watching...  an old woman on a bus,
     kids going to school and you see
     this flash come over them and you
     know immediately that it has
     nothing to do with anything
     external -- that it's in respond
     to a private thought they just
     had? They are just sort of realer
     and more alive. And when you
     notice it so are you. If you look
     at someone long enough, you
     discover their humanity.

Vincent's slack-jawed expression changes. He feels an
intellectual tingle to be having this conversation.

          VINCENT
     I know exactly what you mean.

There's a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity.

          SIMON
     Hold it.

Vincent does so -- hums a bit of "Satisfaction" to
celebrate.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Carol and LESLIE, another waitress, are waiting for their
order at the cappuccino bar. Leslie is telling the story
of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life.
Carol is rapt.

As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give
him notice. Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so
-- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment
commentary on her every action.

          MELVIN
     Clippity clop -- clippity clop --
     she has to pretend she doesn't
     hear me. Listening to the story
     from the upset friend...  now she
     drops off the cappuccino and
     smiles at the putzette who doesn't
     even say, "Thank you." No, the
     putzette wanted the whipped cream
     so back she goes and now she has
     to pass him again and it's getting
     tougher to make believe.

          CAROL
       (reluctant forgiveness)
     Okay.

Melvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an
uncharacteristic rabbit punch.

          CAROL
     What's with the plastic picnic
     ware? Why not try ours...  afraid
     it isn't clean?

          MELVIN
     I see the help -- judgement call.

          CAROL
     Just give yourself a little pep
     talk. "Must try other people's
     clean silverware as part of the
     fun of dining out."

          MELVIN
     What's wrong with your son,
     anyway?

          CAROL
     What do you care?

Melvin just looks at her.

          CAROL
     He's gotta fight to breathe.
     His asthma can just shoot off the
     charts -- he's allergic to dust
     and this is New York and his
     immune system bails on him when
     there's trouble so an ear
     infection...  Is this bothering
     you?

          MELVIN
       (caught)
     No.

          CAROL
     An ear infection can send us to
     the emergency room -- maybe five,
     six times a month where I get
     whatever nine-year-old they just
     made a doctor. Nice chatting with
     you.

          MELVIN
     His name?

          CAROL
     Spencer.

          MELVIN
     Okay.

          CAROL
       (quietly)
     Spence.

She exits.

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO - DAY (SEVERAL WEEKS LATER)

The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary, as Simon puts
the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent. A beat
and then a strange figure crosses between the CAMERA and
the scene -- gone before we can examine him further.

          SIMON
     You can put on anything you want
     now. I might be sort of done
     here...

Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his
immediate needs and puts it on -- dying a little at every
second of silence during the transition... then LOUD
MUSIC PLAYS...  Vincent even GOOSING the VOLUME. Simon
does a take -- he gestures Vincent to take it down --
which Vincent does.

ANGLE - APARTMENT

where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress --
Vincent's two friends from the street sweeping all
objects into large sacks -- one of them, Doug, pauses
to look past the terrace to the studio.

          DOUG
  Lucky Vinnie -- he's a painting.

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, STUDIO - DAY

MUSIC PLAYS -- Simon cleaning up his stuff.

          VINCENT
     So you're practically finished,
     huh?

          SIMON
     Yes...  well, there's one more
     stage -- trying to figure out if
     it's any good.

Simon sneaks a look at the canvas from another
perspective...  he focuses -- then the smallest shy nod
of self-approval -- he's finished. Vincent is desperate
to distract.

CLOSE ON dog as Verdell awakens, stretches and pricks his
ears. He moves quickly to the closed door and starts to
frantically scratch, attracting Simon's attention.

As Simon keeps walking...  Vincent shoots over to the
canvas.

          VINCENT
     Wait -- I want to see the
     painting.

          SIMON
     Just a second -- he has to go.

          VINCENT
     Please!! NO!!!

Simon opens the door and Verdell shoots out like a
bullet. Vincent pauses before the painting and is thrown
to see his humanity captured -- to be "immortalized."

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Doug and Evan are nearly to the front door as VERDELL
stops them with a vicious GROWL and BARK.

Simon is distracted -- looking down at his pet so that he
continues to walk toward Doug and Evan, not noticing
them -- Vincent, terribly afraid, appears behind Simon.

          SIMON
       (to Vincent)
     What's the matter, sweetheart?

He instantly stops. Shocked. Frozen. His eyes on the
stranger, Doug, looking at him. Now Vincent comes in.
Doug greets him.

          DOUG
     Yo.

Simon turns to Vincent.

          SIMON
     Why are you doing this?

          VINCENT
     No. No. No. Hey, that painting
     in there...  I just want to tell
     you...

Now Evan appears holding a brass hat rack.

          EVAN
       (to Vincent)
     What are you doing? Cruising him?

And he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a
club, as the brief savage attack begins.

ON VERDELL

as he starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in
fear. The three attackers leave. Now silence. A single
BARK from VERDELL.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DUSK

A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is
whisked down to the elevator. It's impossible to tell if
Simon is awake or dead. Melvin is standing against the
wall near his door a cop, RAY, interviewing him.

          RAY
     Okay. So you call 911 and don't
     leave your name -- even a dumb
     geezer should know that emergency
     automatically pulls up your name.
     How come you make a mistake like
     that?

          MELVIN
     How come you're pretending to do
     cop work -- 'cause I don't think
     you could find your ass if you
     were spotted the hole.

          RAY
       (stunned)
     What?

          MELVIN
     Just move on. No one here killed
     him.

          RAY
     Oh, is he dead?

          MELVIN
     Ask him.

          RAY
     We will if we can and if we can't,
     we'll come back and ask you again
     and again.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY -
ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT

Frank standing upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a
leash and VERDELL, who is more upset making pathetic
little CRYING SOUNDS.

As we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell...  Frank is talking to the
Sweet-Faced Woman.

          SWEET-FACED WOMAN
     I've been praying for him since I
     heard.

          FRANK
     So I've got to get to the
     hospital. If you could take the
     dog just for tonight.

          SWEET-FACED WOMAN
     Oh, Lord -- I've got all these
     antique knick-knacks...  Or else
     I'd be glad...

          FRANK
     Maybe if you kept locked in
     the bathroom. No? Okay. Thanks.
       (as he turns away and she
          closes the door he adds)
     Old bitch...  Damn dog.

A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed
and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings...

VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches
his mugger:

          FRANK
     You're taking him...  yes...  you're
     taking him -- this will clear the
     books. One night. You want to
     say "no" to me? Try...  because
     I've never felt as nuts as I do
     right this second. I almost want
     you to try saying "no."

          MELVIN
       (quietly)
     I'm not saying nothing to you.

          FRANK
     Thanks for looking after him.

Frank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and
places Verdell inside.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

MUSIC IN: as Frank pulls the door partially closed to
block Verdell's escape.

The music represents Verdell's state of mind -- trapped
in the apartment of the man who tried to kill him. We
STAY with the dog during the O.S. dialogue: As his head
turns in panic we see his various POVs as the dialogue
continues O.S.

          MELVIN (O.S.)
     Hey, where are you going? You
     can't do this.
       (calls after Frank)
     I can't take a dog.
       (a confession)
     Nobody's ever been in here before.

          FRANK (O.S.)
       (threatening)
You don't want to mess with me
today. I'll figure something else
out tomorrow.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Melvin enters -- the dog cowers in the shadows. Now
Melvin sees him.

          MELVIN
     You're dead!!

VERDELL STOPS -- gives Melvin wide berth -- slinking
along the far wall. Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a
bit calming.

          MELVIN
     I don't have dog food. And I
     won't want dog food here. You'll
     eat what we have. You'll eat what
     we eat.

Melvin exits. Verdell is in a major funk.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped
meat, sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the
room.

          MELVIN
     Don't you touch anything.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Verdell cringing as his new master approaches -- MUSIC
CONTINUES ominously. Melvin sets the bowl down and
exits...  Verdell breathes excitedly though looking
alternately in all directions... his recent past making
him suspect this feast is a trick. He sniffs
cautiously -- then dives in -- GOTHIC MUSIC CHANGING on a
dime TO SCORE his RAPTURE... from O.S. we hear the sound
of RUNNING WATER as steam escapes the bathroom -- then
MUSIC OUT -- as Melvin returns...  ignoring Verdell he
sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly. It's odd.
Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl
with his tail to Melvin. Then Melvin begins to play and
sing Monty Python's "Always Look On The Bright Side Of
Life," with its cheerful whistle refrain. Verdell looks
over with surprise and pleasure. But just as mood lifts
and warmth threatens, Melvin stops abruptly, turns out
the lights and exits.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Frank on the phone.

          FRANK
       (into phone)
     Put the solid red dots on three of
     them and the hold blue dots on two
     others...  Well, we're not going to
     sell anything if they know we're
     two weeks into a show and have no
     sales. No, you can't reduce a
     price at this stage...  We're in
     free fall here. Any calls?

          JACKIE
     We can see him.

          FRANK
     I'll meet you in there.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

As Jackie enters.

          JACKIE
     How you doing, great one?

          SIMON
     I haven't looked at myself yet. I
     figured I could tell from your
     reaction.

He turns toward her. Much of his body -- taped -- his
painting hand wrapped. Simon's face is something of a
horror. Swollen, one savage discolored cut. We are into
yuccchhh...  The sight is a jolt. Jackie breaks into
tears...  sobs, actually.

          SIMON
     That bad, huh?

They share a helpless half-laugh -- then Frank appears in
the doorway.

          FRANK
     Hey, hey...
       (as he sees him)
     Haaa...  bad but temporary. The
     nurses say it's much better than
     you looked three weeks ago...  the
     hand will come back...  they're
     sure...

          SIMON
     Jackie, will you hand me the
     mirror?

          JACKIE
       (a small voice)
     No.

She starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse --
then thinks better of it.

          JACKIE
     Wait, I have a smaller one.

But he holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror --
he starts to look -- then thinks better of it.

          SIMON
     So, what's new anyway? How's
     Verdell?

          FRANK
       (sheepish)
     Your neighbor -- Udall -- is
     taking care of him.

          SIMON
       (suddenly alive and upset)
     How could you do that? He'll hurt
     him.

          FRANK
     No, I promise...  not a chance. I
     own this guy. There was no one
     else. I'm on the move too much.
     Trust me.

          SIMON
     You are very certain my dog is
     okay...  because you have no
     idea...

          FRANK
     Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.

Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery,
then he takes a breath -- like someone about to dive
underwater. First a small, mumbled pep talk to himself.

          SIMON
     Okay, waiting gives the devil
     time. Now!

He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror...
he is startled -- the bottom drops out -- leaving him
awed by his misfortune.

          SIMON
     Oh my... Where'd I go? Ummmm?

EXT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

AN ESTABLISHING SHOT FEATURING Verdell tied up in front.

INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

Melvin finishing a plate of eggs, bacon and sausage with
his plastic knife and fork. Carol looks totally beat as
she sets down a cup of coffee. Melvin is craning
periodically to keep an eye of his dog.

          CAROL
     So what are you doing with a dog?

          MELVIN
     Suckered in. Set up. Pushed
     around.

          CAROL
     You're not worried that someone
     might take him?

          MELVIN
     Well, not until now -- for
     Christ's sake.

          CAROL
     Sorry.

          MELVIN
     It's okay -- I'll sit here.

He changes tables for the first time ever so that he can
keep an eye on Verdell. Carol is amazed.

          CAROL
     You know he's a little dog. Next
     time, if Bryan's not here, you can
     bring him in.

          MELVIN
     How old are you?

          CAROL
     Oh, please...

          MELVIN
     If I had to guess by your eyes,
     I'd say you were fifty.

Carol looks at him.

          CAROL
     And if I had to guess by your
     eyes. I'd say you were kind. So,
     so much for eyes. But as long as
     you bring up age...  how old are
     you?

          MELVIN
       (quickly)
     Otherwise, you're not ugly.

          CAROL
       (laughs out loud)
     Okay, pal...  I accept the
     compliment, but go easy -- my
     knees start a-knocking when you
     turn on the charm full blast.

          MELVIN
     What's with the dark?

He indicates the bags under her eyes by tapping his own.

          CAROL
     Dawn patrol -- major dawn patrol.
     My son had a full blown attack.
     And this time, for extra fun, they
     gave us the wrong antibiotics, so
     I get him home...

She reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon -- he goes
nuts.

          MELVIN
     No...  no...  leave it...  the
     bacon's for the dog.

She is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption,
but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty.

          MELVIN
     Last week I was playing the piano
     for him and he likes it, and so I
     decide I'm going to make a little
     joke...

          CAROL
     You all set here?

Melvin nods -- a bit frustrated about not being able to
finish his dog story. He pockets the remaining bacon.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a
beat before Melvin, a remarkably event. Verdell is
avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk.

          MELVIN
     It's a beautiful day for our walk.

Melvin slows -- observes the dog mirroring his behavior.

ON VERDELL

again carefully placing his paws to avoid a crack in the
sidewalk. Melvin laughs out loud -- puts on plastic
gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level.

          MELVIN
     Don't be like me, don't you be
     like me. You stay just the way
     you are because you are a perfect
     man. I'm gonna take you home and
     get you something to eat...  what
     you love.

ANOTHER ANGLE

          FEMALE PASSERSBY
       (charmed)
     Ohhh. I'd like to be treated like
     that.

          MELVIN
       (all smiles to Verdell)
     Let's go home and do some writing.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Melvin whaling away at his computer, reading to himself
with great satisfaction as he goes.

Verdell sits at his chair, fascinated by the speed of his
master's fingers on the keyboard. He reads his writing
aloud to the dog.

          MELVIN
     "He turned off the gas jets and
     carried her outside. He kissed
     her brow and when her eyes opened
     and found him, he said, 'there are
     easier ways to break a date.' She
     laughed. The only sensible
     ambition he had ever known was now
     realized. He had made the girl
     happy. And what a girl. 'You've
     saved my life,' she said, 'you'd
     better make it up to me.'"

Exhilarated by his own words, he shuts down the machine...

          MELVIN
       (singing to Verdell)
     Done!
       (playing with him some)
     Yes, I hate the doggy...  yes, I
     hate the doggy.

He exits.

          MELVIN (V.O.)
     Sixty-two books... done!

As the dog goes shooting off to the kitchen we leave our
couple's play time for...

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY

As the rookie invalid awakens in precisely the same foul
mood he'd had on falling asleep. In the living room, the
maid, NORA, is talking with Jackie -- we catch only a few
words as they review Simon's mounting pile of bills and
talk of how long Nora can stay on.

INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

Frank knocking on Melvin's door. He opens it.

          FRANK
     How's Verdell doing?

          MELVIN
     He's a pain in the ass.

As he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and,
without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's
surprise.

          FRANK
     Simon's home. I was sort of
     hoping you could keep the dog
     until he's had a chance to think
     and adjust...

          MELVIN
       (leaping at the chance)
     It's been five weeks...  another
     few won't kill me.

          FRANK
     No. He wants him back. He'll be
     by tomorrow.

          MELVIN
       (too loudly, weirdly)
     Okay by me.

Frank exits.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Melvin sits -- Verdell looks up at him. Melvin walks to
the door. He turns the lock... then checks that they are
locked...  checks again to make sure he turned them in the
correct direction...  turns from the door...  then back to
check once more. And again...  and again...  anguished,
until now he breaks briefly, the dog looking on.

INT. NEW YORK BUILDING - MELVIN'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

Melvin opens the door -- looks at the scarred Simon in a
wheelchair and shudders...

          MELVIN
     That's some face they left hanging
     on you. You look like...

          SIMON
       (interrupting)
     Could you take it just a little
     easy, Mr. Udall?

A beat of silence as Melvin thinks whether to comply.

          SIMON
     Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?
       (to Melvin)
     By the way, thanks for saving me.

          MELVIN
     I called. I never touched you. I
     didn't leave my name or nothing.

          SIMON
       (not listening)
     Verdell?

ON VERDELL

Totally weirded out...  hiding behind Melvin...  now Melvin
shifts and Simon and Verdell see each other...  Simon
smiles at the dog...  he is emotionally caught up in the
reunion.

          SIMON
     Hi, sweetheart.

Verdell isn't eager.

ON SIMON

The first gnawing pains of rejection.

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Simon pats his leg -- trying unsuccessfully to get
Verdell to approach him. Instead the dog goes to the
door and scratches at it. Jackie starts to pick the dog
up.

          SIMON
     No. Please, don't force him.

          JACKIE
       (to dog)
     You little stinker. He's given
     you everything.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

MELVIN'S POV

Verdell's towel on the floor -- near his bowl.

BACK TO SCENE

Melvin's lips compress... he sits on the piano bench and
hits a few keys...  looks at Verdell's empty spot again...
there are those who "get the joke" -- Melvin is clearly
one -- he laughs suddenly and helplessly even as he feels
the panic rise in him...

...  all his painstaking success in keeping the lid on and
now it threatens to blow for a reason he articulates.

          MELVIN
     Over the dog...  an ugly dog.

It's hilarious. But now the humor detours. An actual
sob is choked back...  he gets up -- following a definite
pattern across the room. He is conducting a small but
highest-stakes fight for survival. Momentarily a scared,
beaten middle-aged man -- he races out the door.

EXT. NYC STREETS - DAY

Melvin charging as fast as crack checks allow and then
turning into a building with a copper sign reading
"Grammercy Park Psychiatric Group."

          MELVIN
     Worst sidewalk in New York and
     look where they put in.

INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

Melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word.

          MELVIN
     Help!

          DOCTOR
     If you want to see me you will not
     do this. You will make an
     appointment...

          MELVIN
     Explain to me how you can diagnose
     someone as "obsessive compulsive
     disorder" and then act like I have
     any choice in barging in.

          DOCTOR
     There's not going to be a debate.
     You must leave.

The Doctor moves into the hallway, forcing Melvin to
follow.

          MELVIN
     You said you could help me --
     what was that -- a tease?

          DOCTOR
     I can help you if you take the
     responsibility to keep regular
     app --

          MELVIN
       (suddenly)
     You changed the room around...

          DOCTOR
     Two years ago...

Melvin shakes his head -- as if things weren't bad enough
he must go through a careful exercise noting every new
element before he's at all comfortable... as he studies
each object. The Doctor is professionally intrigued
despite himself.

          DOCTOR
     I also regrew my beard...  but
     you're not interested in changes
     in me... so it's like I always
     told you...  when it comes to
     people you...

          MELVIN
     Shhhhhhh. I don't have this
     mountain of available time...  I
     got to get to my restaurant on
     time. Do you know how hard it is
     for me to be here?

          DOCTOR
     Yes.
       (as Melvin starts
          for the office)
     No.

INT. PSYCHIATRISTS' WAITING ROOM - DAY

More PATIENTS in the almost-crowded waiting room. Melvin
passes through -- visibly drawn and upset. He stops.
Eyes on them. Then:

          MELVIN
       (to other patients)
     What if this is as good as it
     gets?

They look stricken. He exits.

INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

As he walks to his booth and sits down. Enormous relief.
CHERYL, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his
table -- unseen by Melvin as he takes out his utensils
and arranges them. In a corner booth, four big TRANSIT
AUTHORITY POLICE are having a meal together. Cheryl
looks at his utensils.

          CHERYL
     What the heck are those for?

          MELVIN
     No. No. Get Carol.

          CHERYL
     I'm filling in. We don't know if
     she's coming back. She might have
     to get a job closer to home.

          MELVIN
     What are you trying to do to me?

          CHERYL
     What the heck do you mean?

          MELVIN
     Hey, elephant girl, call her or
     something...  just let her do my
     one meal here. I'll pay whatever.
     I'll wait.
       (as she doesn't
          budge; he screams)
     Do it!!!

The MANAGER comes over, gesturing to the table of police
that he can handle it. All attention is on Melvin.

          MANAGER
     Out. Be silent or leave.

          MELVIN
     I'll be quiet. Just let me wait.
     No problem. Get her here -- have
     her get me two sausages, four
     bacon, two eggs over easy and
     coffee. I'm not a prick here --
     I'm a great customer. This day is
     a disaster. I can't handle this,
     too.

          MANAGER
     Get out immediately or there's
     going to be trouble.

Melvin looks at the police, sizes up the hopeless
situation and rises.

          MELVIN
     There's going to be trouble???

He walks toward the door as Cheryl and all the other
employees applaud his defeat. As he passes a BUSBOY near
the door he hands him 20 dollars.

          MELVIN
     Carol's last name?

          BUSBOY
     Connelly.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

An uncomfortable Melvin sitting in the back of a taxi.

MELVIN'S POV

A neighborhood in Brooklyn -- a community. Melvin, ever
the shark observer, looks from the cab to see slices of
community life -- MEN in front of a bar, PARENTS giving
their CHILD a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local
store -- two YOUNG WOMEN discuss dating.

EXT. CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY

As he exits -- RINGS the BELL and is BUZZED in.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DOOR/HALLWAY - DAY

Carol opens the door just as he arrives on her landing.
She holds a container of ice, washclothes and a
thermometer.

          MELVIN
     I'm hungry.
       (on Carol's astonished
          look)
     You've upset my whole day. I
     haven't eaten.

          CAROL
     What are you doing here?

Melvin ignores the question, instead answering a charge
he had imagined she might make...

          MELVIN
     This is not a sexist thing. If
     you were a waiter I would still be
     here saying...

          CAROL
     Are you totally gone? This is my
     private home...

          MELVIN
     I am trying to keep emotions out of
     this. Even though this is an
     important issue to me and I have
     strong feelings about the subject.

          CAROL
     What subject? That I wasn't there
     to take crap from you and bring
     you eggs? Do you have any control
     over how creepy you allow yourself
     to get?

          MELVIN
     Yes, I do, as a matter of fact...
     and to prove it I have not gotten
     personal and you have. Why aren't
     you at work? You're not sick --
     you don't look sick... just very
     tired and bitter.

          CAROL
     My son is sick, okay?

Even saying the sentence, "My son is sick" pushes some
emotions toward the surface which are wasted on the crazy
man at her threshold.

          MELVIN
     What about your mother?

          CAROL
     How do you know about my mother?

          MELVIN
     I hear you talk when I'm
     waiting!!!

She crosses to the sink to dump the ice. Melvin takes a
step inside. Spencer, seven and looking ill, walks into
the room.

          CAROL
     Sorry, honey...  I'll be right
     there.

          MELVIN
       (uncomfortably)
     How ya doing?

Spencer just stares at him.

          MELVIN
       (miffed)
     You should answer when someone
     talks to you...

Carol eyes Melvin with disgust and disbelief then
emphatically gestures him to "clear out." Melvin backs
out the door.

          CAROL
     Sorry. There is a limit, Melvin,
     and I can't handle you teaching
     my son manners.

She closes the door in his face, then walks to her son
and leads him back to his room.

INT. SPENCER'S ROOM

CAMERA MOVES TOWARD mother and son sitting on the edge of
Spencer's bed. She holds a digital thermometer to his
ear. They both count down the seconds.

          CAROL AND SPENCER
     5...  4...  3...  2...  1...  Bingo.

          SPENCER
     104.9

          CAROL
     We are going to treat ourselves to
     a cab ride.

EXT. BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - ANGLE ON CAROL - DAY

As Carol carries her young son through a class of
uniformed KIDS from a Catholic elementary school. She
spots Melvin about to enter a cab.

          CAROL
     Melvin, wait!

The school kids pick up the chant in unison.

          SCHOOL KIDS
     Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait!
     Melvin, wait!

He turns to face them.

          MELVIN
     Shut up, kids!

They immediately obey as Carol approaches him.

          CAROL
     Melvin...  give us a lift. We've
     got to go see our friends at the
     hospital.

Melvin is thrown...  he pauses a beat...  then holds the
rear door open as Carol hustles the kid inside. The
maneuver puts the beet red, sweating Spencer at his face.

          MELVIN
     I'll ride up front. Cover your
     mouth when you cough, kid.

INT. BROOKLYN CAB - DAY

As they settle in and drive off.

          CAROL
     Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital,
     please and quickly please.

EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

As Carol enters the hospital.

          CAROL
       (calling back)
     I owe you three dollars.

Melvin follows behind her as she carries her son...

          MELVIN
     Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll
     get back to work today?

          CAROL
       (furiously)
     No!!! Stay away from me!

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for
Melvin. Jackie sits across from Simon's wheel chair...
she has some index cards in her laps which she
occasionally consults and shuffles.

          JACKIE
     I feel terrible that I have to...
     Simon? Forget about the dog for a
     second.

Simon forces his attention to Jackie.

          SIMON
     Sorry. What are those cards?

          JACKIE
       (a bit embarrassed)
     Frank's idea. He thought I should
     have notes so I did this right...
     maintained focus, didn't get
     emotional and tried not to terrify
     you.

          SIMON
       (scared shitless)
     Terrify me?

          JACKIE
     See, he's right. I need the
     cards.
       (reading from cards)
     Simon, you're broke.

ANGLE ON VERDELL

as their conversation continues -- the dog is distressed.

          JACKIE (O.S.)
     The medical bill are 61 thousand
     now. I've spoken to your parents
     and they didn't hang up or
     anything -- they just said they
     would feel strange calling you.

          SIMON (O.S.)
     Well, I can't reach them.

Verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off. He turns
for:

          SIMON
       (to Verdell)
     Here, baby...  what is it,
     Verdell?...  You miss the tough
     guy...
       (trying to be
          Melvin-like)
     Well, here I am, you little pissant
     mop, happy to see me? How about
     another ride down the chute? Oh,
     God...  I don't mean it,
     sweetheart...
       (on Jackie's look)
     I'm sorry. I know...

Verdell hides behind a chair.

          JACKIE
     Frank loves you. You know that...
     but I've spoken to him and he
     feels that --
       (reading from card)
     -- as a businessman, with limited
     resources...

          SIMON
     I'll be able to keep my apartment
     and studio, won't I?...  Just tell
     me.

As Jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card.

          SIMON
       (overwhelmed)
Wow...

Verdell has come near him -- he reaches out a hand to pet
the dog and the dog ducks.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

He is trying to write. He can't. His world has been upset.
He walks away from his work -- a highly unusual act. He
is distressed -- and then an idea and he exits.

INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY

We are looking at ZOE, the receptionist. She is listening
with interest to an O.S. conversation while answering
phone calls, "Premier Publishing."

          FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
     Yes, you write more than anyone
     else. Yes, you make us a lot of
     money, but isn't there someone
     more appropriate to...

          MELVIN (O.S.)
     I need this. Just say, "Melvin,
     I'll try," okay?

          FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
       (resigned)
     Melvin, I'll try.

They appear now -- the woman tall, attractive, etc. She
pauses at the elevator.

          FEMALE EXECUTIVE
     Now, on a pleasant note, our son
     got accepted at Brown. My
     husband...

          MELVIN
       (curtly)
     Great, wonderful. I don't need
     you to wait with me.

She nods, pissed, waves and leaves. As Melvin waits, Zoe
summons her moxie.

          ZOE
     I can't resist. You usually move
     through here so quickly and I have
     so many questions I want to ask
     you. You have no idea what your
     work means to me.

          MELVIN
     What's it mean?

          ZOE
     That somebody out there knows what
     it's like to be...
       (taps her head and heart)
     in here.

          MELVIN
     Oh God, this is like a nightmare.

          ZOE
     Aw come on, just a couple of
     questions -- how hard is that?

As he hits the button, wipes his fingers, hits the button
etc.

          ZOE
     How do you write women so well?

          MELVIN
       (as he turns
          toward her)
I think of a man and take away
reason and accountability.

The fan is jolted as the elevator doors open and close.

EXT. STREET NEAR CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY

A depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home. She is
suddenly wary -- SOUND DIALED DOWN -- as we MOVE CLOSER.

CAROL'S POV

A car at the curb with "MD" license plate.

BACK TO SCENE

As Carol breaks into a run.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWAY/HALLWAY - DAY

As she bounds the stairs, comes to her apartment door and
jiggles with the keys, a strange prescient whimpering
sound coming from her. As she enters the apartment.

          CAROL
     Hello? Hello?

          VOICE (O.S.)
     Mrs. Connelly, I'm in here.

The worst confirmed, she moves down the narrow hallway,
her innards squirting the same chemicals that drives elk
on opening day of the hunting season.

INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - DAY

          CAROL
     What? Please? Now? Tell me?!

          DR. BETTES
     Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes
     ...  Dr. Bettes.

          CAROL
     Not your name...  what are you
     telling me your name for!! Where
     is he?

          DR. BETTES
     He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.

          CAROL
       (overlapping)
     Tell me how bad it is. I let him
     go out last night when it was so
     cool without an overshirt -- just
     and underone with just the straps
     and I know better...  and I let him
     talk me into it. He was whining
     and...  you don't need this. Give
     me a second to catch hold.

And so she does. Wow does she... and gives us some
notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it
takes to subdue it as Dr. Bettes keeps reassuring her and
she keeps nodding... finally a deep breath as Spencer
enters from the bathroom. All at hyper speed now.
Salvation as farce.

          SPENCER
       (to his mother)
     Hi...
       (they kiss)
     Did you know there are doctors who
     come to your house?

          CAROL
     No, I didn't.
       (to Bettes)
     So why are you h...

Beverly, Carol's mother, enters the room. She is ebullient
which, if life allowed, would be her natural state.

          BEVERLY
     I didn't know you had a secret
     admire.

          CAROL
     Huh?

          BEVERLY
     You met the gift.

          SPENCER
     He's good...  And I'm an expert on
     doctors.

          CAROL
       (to Spencer)
     Stay out of this...  Doctor?

          DR. BETTES
     My wife is Melvin Udall's
     publisher.
       (as Carol reacts)
     She says I have to take great care
     of this guy because you're
     urgently needed back at work.
     What work do you do?

          CAROL
     I'm a waitress.

ON Dr. Bettes' reaction her mother adds a saving grace.

          BEVERLY
     In Manhattan.

          VOICE (O.S.)
     Dr. Bettes?

          DR. BETTES
     In here.

A NURSE enters.

          NURSE
     Sorry it took so long. I don't
     know Brooklyn.

          DR. BETTES
     It's okay, Terry.
       (hands her blood
          vail)
     Tell the lab I'd like the report
     back today.

Carol and her mother exchange a look of incredulity.

          CAROL
     You're going to get the results
     today?!

MOVING SHOT

As we approach the doctor and Carol seated across from
each other at a small table... soft voices...  relaxation.
Bettes is examining medicine bottles.

          DR. BETTES
     How long has he been having
     problems?

          CAROL
     Since forever.

          DR. BETTES
     Have they done blood tests on him?

          CAROL
     Yes.

          DR. BETTES
     Only in the emergency room or when
     he was well.

          CAROL
     Emergency room only.

          DR. BETTES
     Have they done skin testing for
     allergies?

          CAROL
     No.

          DR. BETTES
     They haven't done the standard
     scratch test. Where they make
     small injections into the skin?

          CAROL
     No. I asked. They said it's not
     covered under my plan. And it's
     not necessary anyway.

          DR. BETTES
     It's amazing these things weren't
     done.

          CAROL
     Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of
     shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.

          DR. BETTES
     No. Actually, I think that's
     their technical name.

          CAROL
     Once the tests come back, is there
     someone I can reach in your office
     for the results?

          DR. BETTES
     Me. My home number is on this
     card.

          CAROL
     His home number.

Carol look at her mother -- they share a laugh. Beverly
has a hard time stopping.

          CAROL
       (to doctor)
     Do you want some juice or coffee
     or two female slaves?

          DR. BETTES
     Water...  Nobody told you it might
     be a good idea to remove the
     carpeting and drapes in Spencer's
     room?

          CAROL
     No.

She starts towards Spencer's room.

          DR. BETTES
     You don't have to do it this
     second...  it's not dangerous or
     anything. It's just something
     that's advisable. Look, there's
     a lot to be checked but...  Hey,
     your son is going to feel a
     good deal better at the very
     least...

She pats his head...  Then embraces him with fierce
intimacy.

          CAROL
     Doc!!!
       (then)
     So listen, you gotta let me know
     about the additional costs -- one
     way or the other we'll...

          DR. BETTES
     They're considerable. But Mr.
     Udall wants to be billed.

She takes this as a blow to the heart, stomach and groin.

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Simon practices walking using his cane. A tearstained
Nora hugs him good-bye.

          NORA
     You poor, poor man.

          SIMON
     Let's use just one poor, okay?
     Anyway, dear, thanks for
     everything. Forgive my recent
     crankiness and as soon as things
     are on track again I'll call.

She kisses him and starts for the door and suddenly a
sharp intake of breath -- she's forgotten something.

          SIMON
     What's wrong?

          NORA
     Who's going to walk Verdell?

Simon hadn't thought of this either.

          SIMON
     No, no.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DAY

Nora holding her things, knocks on Melvin's door. Melvin
opens the door. Nora is still sniffling. He misinterprets.

          MELVIN
     Is he dead yet?

          NORA
     No! Would there be any way for
     you to be willing to walk his dog
     for him?

          MELVIN
     Absolutely.

          NORA
     Not just today -- Uh, could you
     do it -- until, until he gets
     back on his feet?

          MELVIN
     Sure thing.

          NORA
     You're a wonderful man. Two
     o'clock is a good time. Here's
     the key in case he's asleep. Open
     the curtains for him, so he sees
     God's beautiful work and knows
     that even things like this happen
     for the best.

          MELVIN
     Where'd they teach you to talk
     like this -- some Panama City
     "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"?
     Or was today getaway day and your
     last shot at his whiskey. Sell
     crazy some place else -- we're all
     stocked up here.

He closes the door in her face. She stands there...
thrown by the abruptness -- then lifts the two paper
shopping bags holding her things -- walks back toward the
elevator -- pausing briefly outside Simon's door -- then
continues on her way.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT

The doctor gone, mother and daughter arguing.

          CAROL
     There is a seriously goofy man
     behind this. You are not allowed
     to block out that fact.

          BEVERLY
     Do you really want to go back to
     the runt doctors in Emergency who
     keep telling us they can't help?

          CAROL
     It lets a crazy man into our
     lives.

          BEVERLY
     Come on. Why fight when we know
     how it will come out. This isn't
     like stocking or a string of
     pearls. You don't send this one
     back.

EXT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Shades drawn. Simon is a wheelchair...  the PHONE RINGS.
He goes to answer... the phone across the bed so that
reaching for the phone is a brief but difficult
struggle... he grunts with pain, hope and anxiety as he
answers.

          SIMON
     Hello?...  yes...  sure...  finally,
     huh? Why, "finally"? Because I
     called you so many times. Maybe
     20.
       (relief)
     Oh, boy...  I was hoping it was
     something like that. You didn't
     get one of them, huh? 'Cause I
     mean it wasn't only your office --
     it was your home, hotel and the
     cigar club you like in San
     Francisco. No -- Sarcastic...  Of
     course. I believe you. No, don't
     fire anyone...  Please. Maybe I'm
     wrong about the 20 times. Take a
     breath...
              (more)
     So, you miss me a little? Hey,
     strike the question -- How's the
     case going? Really. Fantastic.
     I didn't hear. I haven't been
     watching. Great. Just great.
     I'm so happy. Whoopie! Me?
     Well, I'm mending. No, I look
     fine. Well, some of the damage
     might still be noticeable if you
     look closely...

He runs a hand across his scarred and still bloated and
beaten face...

          SIMON
     Carl, I need some help and you're
     the logical one to turn to.
       (aghast)
     No! Not 'cause I blame you for
     what happened. I hardly get how
     you can ever think that. No, I'm
     not being sarcastic.
       (trying to figure it
          out)
     I guess because you hired the guy
     who did this you think...  No, I am
     a sarcastic person. Well, if
     you must know, the reason I said
     you were the logical person is
     because you always told me how you
     thought I was this great person
     who made you feel good about
     humanity and everything. You do
     remembering saying that? Well, whew.
     Okay, so Carl. I hate asking but
     this money thing is ridiculously
     serious...

He picks up an index card from his night stand and takes
the leap -- reading the text he prepared in advance.

          SIMON
     "Will you please loan me money? I
     will pay you back. I will give
     you whatever percentage of my
     income I don't absolutely need
     until I do. It will take a while.
     But I don't know what I'll do if
     you say"... that.
       (as he listens)
     I understand...  yes...  No, I do.
       (a bit of boldness)
     But you know, you know -- you
     didn't even ask how much, Carl?
     Well, Frank has no right to
     discuss how much I'm in hock...
     no, you're right -- not the point.
     So...  what have you been up to???
     Uh-huh... Oh, the group show...
     how was it? Well, I'm not
     surprised that there's that much
     talent around...  great...  Look --
     gotta go...  no, you shouldn't feel
     that way at all...  take care, you,
     too...  you, too...  Good-bye.
       (as he hangs up)
     Pal o' mine.

It's very quiet.

LONG SHOT - SIMON

A lonely figure -- who now holds his good hand up to his
face and appears on the verge of enormous emotional
release -- CAMERA MOVES TOWARD him as if to rendezvous
with the moment of catharsis...

...  but Simon is denied even this small luxury as the
CAMERA ABRUPTLY ADJUSTS just as he begins sobbing to
focus on the door opening and Melvin and Verdell entering
the room.

          MELVIN
     Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

          SIMON
     Thank you for walking him.

Simon wheels away from Melvin.

          SIMON
     If you'll excuse me I'm not
     feeling so well.

          MELVIN
     It smells like shit in here?

          SIMON
     Go away.

          MELVIN
     That cleaning woman doesn't...

          SIMON
     Please, just leave.

          MELVIN
     Where are all your queer party
     friends?

          SIMON
       (his first shout)
     Get out.

Melvin pauses -- Simon weeping... Verdell looks at Simon
with concern. Melvin is thrown. Moved?

          SIMON
     Nothing worse than having to feel
     this way in front of you?

          MELVIN
     Nellie, you're a disgrace to
     depression.

          SIMON
     Rot in hell, Melvin.

          MELVIN
     No need to stop being a lady...
     quit worrying -- you'll be back on
     your knees in no time.

Simon swings his arm and cast at Melvin -- the sudden
attack jolts Melvin but not as much as what follows.

          SIMON
     Is this fun for you? Well, you
     lucky devil...  It just gets better
     and better. I am losing my
     apartment and Frank wants me to
     promise to paint hotter subjects
     and to beg my parents, who haven't
     called, for help... and I won't.
     And I don't want to paint anymore.

Melvin has made for the door...  Simon blocks him.

          SIMON
     So the life I was trying for is
     over. The life I had is gone and
     I am feeling so damn sorry for
     myself that it is difficult to
     breathe. Right times for you --
     huh, Melvin. The gay neighbor is
     terrified...
       (a sudden screamed
          word surprises them
          both)
     Terrified...  Lucky you, you're
     here for rock bottom...  me
     wallowing in self-pity in front of
     you, you absolute horror of a
     human being...

As Simon works to stop crying, Melvin is weird with
discomfort.

          MELVIN
     Well, I'll do one thing for you
     that might cheer you up.

          SIMON
     Get out.

          MELVIN
     Don't piss on a gift, tough guy.
     You want to know why the dog
     prefers me...  it's not affection.
     It's a trick.

Simon looks up, his mood turning on a dime -- he's
rapt...  Melvin comes and stands by his wheelchair.

          MELVIN
     I carry bacon in my pocket.

          SIMON
       (pleased)
     Oh, my gosh.

          MELVIN
       (hands him bacon)
     Now we'll both call him.

          SIMON
     Come on, sweetheart...

          MELVIN
     Yo, yo, yo...

Verdell goes like a bullet to Melvin... who is totally
surprised and staggered by the implications. True love
and such.

          SIMON
     Would you leave now, please?

          MELVIN
     Stupid dog.
       (to Simon)
     I don't get it.

He exits...  looking apologetically at Simon in stoic
ruin.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Carol in bed on the pullout sofa...  She is in turmoil...
there is THUNDER, but no rain. She walks to the kitchen.
She is trembling as she drinks a glass of water and exits.

INT. BEVERLY BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is on an air shaft and this is where Carol
shares a closet with her mother, who is now asleep.

Carol quietly extracts a dress from the closet, leaving
her nightgown on the floor. There is something sexy
here, the woman in Carol churning. She plops on a summer
dress -- no time for underwear.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

Carol seeing a bus and dashing after it.

EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - TWO AM

Carol crossing to Manhattan. She looks as if she's on
her way to some final exam where she has no notion of the
subject.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NEAR MELVIN'S BUILDING -
NIGHT (RAIN)

Hot summer night as she gets off the bus and now the
rains come...  We are in a familiar neighborhood.

ANGLE ON MELVIN AND SIMON'S APARTMENT HOUSE

As Carol consults the slip of paper with the address on
it.

INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT (RAIN)

As she enters building and realizes it's not just that
she's wet -- the thin summer dress is a winner in any wet
T-shirt contest...  the fabric clinging to her breasts,
like the old movie poster of The Deep.

INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

As Carol passes Simon's door...  stands in front of
Melvin's apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness
and knocks on the door...  then RINGS the BELL. Finally
Carol hears MUFFLED THROAT CLEARING on the other side
of the door.

          CAROL
     Uh, Udall?

          MELVIN (O.S.)
     Carol the waitress?

          CAROL
     Yes.

As we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her
breasts and gasps. She grasps the fabric and holds it
straight out just as Melvin opens the door. His hair is
static city, standing on end as he periodically gives it
self-conscious pats.

          CAROL
     The doctors had your billing
     address. I'm sorry about the
     hour.

          MELVIN
     I was working...  can't you just
     drop me a thank-you note?

          CAROL
     That's not why I'm here...
       (tearing suddenly)
     ...  though you have no idea what
     it's like to have a real
     conversation with a doctor about
     Spencer...

           MELVIN
       (very uncomfortable)
     Note. Put it in the note.

          CAROL
     Why did yo do this for me?

          MELVIN
     To get you back at work so you can
     wait on me.

          CAROL
     But you do have some idea how
     strange that sounds??? I'm
     worried that you did this
     because...

She pauses -- the beginning of an extraordinarily long
silence. Finally.

          MELVIN
     You waiting for me to say
     something?
       (as she shakes her head)
     What sort of thing do you want?
     Look, I'll be at the restaurant
     tomorrow.

          CAROL
     I don't think I can wait until
     tomorrow. This needs clearing up.

          MELVIN
     What needs clearing up?

          CAROL
       (strong and true)
     I'm not going to sleep with you.
     I will never, ever sleep with you.
     Never. Not ever.

Melvin's reaction? Well, he'll never get credit for the
brief but intense inner struggle -- the struggle not to
scream --

-- not to cry -- to process the sudden and stunning hurt
during his half turn away from her -- and then answer
hoarsely.

          MELVIN
     I'm sorry. We don't open for the
     no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.

Carol is amused, surprised...  maybe, in some small way
ever taken by his style...  but top priority is clarity.

          CAROL
     I'm not kidding.

          MELVIN
     Okay!!!! Anything else?!?

          CAROL
     Just how grateful I am.

Her mission completed -- she turns.

          MELVIN
     So you'll be at work?

          CAROL
     Yes.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

It's a 3:22 a.m. as the two digital clocks on Melvin's
night stand tell us...  He gets up -- the first time we've
seen his waking routine -- taps one foot on the floor
twice -- then the other foot -- two more taps and his
body angles from the bed in a deliberate way.

He is having anxiety. He sits at the piano and plays
very briefly...  Stops -- wipes some sweat from his
forehead...  Walks to his computer room -- turns the light
on and then quickly off...  Walks to his refrigerator...

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN, INSIDE REFRIGERATOR -
NIGHT

As he grabs a cardboard take-out box...

INT. NEW YORK APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY/SIMON'S APT.

He knocks of Simon's door...  It opens quickly.

SIMON'S APARTMENT

          MELVIN
     I took a chance you were up.

Simon walks painfully back to a chair.

          MELVIN
     I brought you Chinese soup.

          SIMON
     Thanks.

          MELVIN
     I have never been so tired in my
     life. Okay, if I sit here?

          SIMON
     Got any easier questions?

Melvin sits and moans -- the dog sitting near him.

          MELVIN
     I haven't been sleeping. I
     haven't been clear or felt like
     myself. I'm in trouble. Some son
     of a bitch is burning my bridges
     behind my back...  But the
     tiredness -- boy...  Not just
     sleepy.

          SIMON
     But sick -- nauseous -- where
     everything looks distorted and
     everything inside just aches --
     when you can barely get up the
     will to complain.

          MELVIN
       (brightening)
     Yeah...

He feels a touch of community and not knowing where to
take it from here.

          MELVIN
     I'm glad we did this.

He rises and makes an awkward exit.

          MELVIN
     Good talking to you.

He exits -- Simon puzzled and concerned.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Carol seated working on a letter... She is trying to
express her gratitude... An enormous sheaf of completed
pages sit next to her... She is so involved she doesn't
even look up as a young man, SEAN, knocks on the door and
is let in by Beverly.

They exchange greetings and move inside where we faintly
hear Spencer greeting him... We MOVE IN and read over
Carol's shoulder -- "I'm sorry to have gotten sloppy and
emotional in this letter, but it would have been on my
conscionce (sic) forever if I didn't tell you how
gratefull (sic)... "

          BEVERLY
     You're not still writing that
     thank-you note?

          CAROL
     I'm on the last page. How do you
     spell conscience?

          BEVERLY
     C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean
     from the bakery to baby-sit so
     let's go out.

          CAROL
     I still don't feel safe leaving
     Spencer with someone. How do you
     spell it again?

          BEVERLY
     Spencer is okay. You'd better
     start finding something else to do
     with your free time. If you can't
     feel good about this break and
     step out a little...
       (struts and pumps
          her arms)
     You ought to get Mr. Udall to send
     you over a psychiatrist.

          CAROL
       (more emotionally
          than she intended)
     I don't need one 'cause I know
     what's really going on here. I
     have to finish this letter or
     I'll go nuts.
       (looking at paper;
          weepy)
     This can't be right -- con-
     science.

Carol breathes heavily -- gets control, stopping herself
on the brink of crying.

          BEVERLY
     Carol. What?

Carol is amazed at herself... that she might not be able
to stem the flow... wide-eyed with apprehension, she
looks at her mother, who, in return, only nods permission
for Carol to let it go. A last defiant snort from Carol
-- and then she is overwhelmed. The headline comes first.

          CAROL
     I don't know... It's very strange
     not feeling that stupid panic
     thing inside you all the time.
     Without that you just start
     thinking about yourself -- and
     what does that ever get anybody.
     Today, on the bus there was this
     adorable couple and I felt myself
     giving them a dirty look -- I had
     no idea everything was...

          BEVERLY
     Go ahead.

          CAROL
       (great, forceful
          hand gestures)
     ... moving in the wrong
     direction... Away from when I
     even remembered what it was like
     to have a man to... anything...
     hold fucking -- sorry -- hands
     with, for Christ's sake. I was
     feeling like really bad that Dr.
     Bettes is married.
       (this next one's
          tough)
     Which is probably why I make poor
     Spencer hug me more than he wants
     to... Like the poor kid doesn't
     have enough problems. He has to
     make up for his mom not getting
     any.
       (weeps at her
          insight)
     Oh, boy. Who needs these
     thoughts?

          BEVERLY
     Spencer's doing fine. So what are
     you saying, that you're frustr...

          CAROL
     Leave me be! Why are you doing
     this? Why are you picking at my
     sores... What is it that you
     want?... You want what? What's
     with you? I hope getting me
     thinking of everything that's
     wrong when all I want is to not
     do this has some purpose.
       (puffy; red;
          furious)
     What is it, Mom? No kidding.

Slumped, fought out -- Carol gets out one last, naked
husky voiced question.

          CAROL
     What is it you want? What?

          BEVERLY
     I want us to go out.

A beat, then.

          CAROL
       (simply)
     Okay.

INT. CAROL'S APT, SPENCER'S ROOM, HALLWAY - NIGHT

As they enter, still wiping away the effects of their
cry.

          CAROL
       (to Sean)
     We're going out.

          SEAN
       (looking at their
          red eyes)
     Looks like fun.

She kisses Spencer -- almost getting involved in what
he's doing -- then sees her mother waiting.

          CAROL
     Okay -- we're out of here. I love
     you.

Spencer nods -- involved with Sean. CAMERA FOLLOWS Carol
as she exits the apartment -- her mother leading.
Halfway down the stairs, she stops and reverses herself,
going back to the apartment which she re-enters -- then
to her son to ask:

          CAROL
     Do you love me?

          SPENCER
     Uh-huh.

Carol exits.

EXT. STREET - NEAR CAROL'S BLDG. (MOVING) - DAY

Beverly and Carol walking past the store windows. A
simple and unprecedented experience in their recent
lives.

          BEVERLY
     Nice to get out, isn't it?

Carol nods tightly... then they wrap arms around each
other and continue walking, turning into a corner bar.

INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON CAROL - DAY

As Carol stands nervously while Lisa finishes reading her
14-page letter. In the b.g. Melvin and Frank are seated
at the same table and in earnest conversation. Lisa
keeps flicking away tears -- a few drops on the pages.

           CAROL
     Don't get it wet.

Lisa brushes the paper -- finishes and embraces Carol.

          CAROL
     So it's okay?

          LISA
     You almost have me liking him.
     You sure come from the heart. I
     never knew what you went through
     with everything.

          CAROL
     I wanted him to know how much he'd
     done.
       (looking over)
     Can you believe he's eating with
     someone.

ON MELVIN & FRANK

          MELVIN
     It's not my dog and this Simon
     seems to have enough on his mind
     -- but he did throw up twice and
     his spark is off.

          FRANK
     Sure -- take him to the vet.

          MELVIN
     I did. And his stomach is out of
     whack. So they need him for a
     couple of days.

          FRANK
     Do it.

          CAROL
     Melvin.

She self-consciously hands him with the thick envelope.

          MELVIN
     What's this?

          CAROL
       (sotto)
     A thank-you note for what you did
     for me.

He hands it back to her deliberately. She takes it and
walks back to the service area where, embarrassed,
confused, and messed with -- she tosses the note.

After Carol leaves...

          FRANK
     She's nice.

          MELVIN
       (to Frank)
     Really nice. Shouldn't that be a
     good thing... telling someone,
     'no thanks required.'

          FRANK
     It looks like it really went over.
     You're sure making the rounds.
     Simon says you brought him soup
     last night. I hope he doesn't
     write you a note.

Melvin looks up -- wary -- his brain sends a disturbing
message.

          FRANK
     What?

          MELVIN
     "What?" Look at you... You sense
     a mark.

          FRANK
     Hey -- you called me... I...

          MELVIN
     About a dog.

          FRANK
     Yeah, but it's all about Simon
     now... you helped with the dog...
     And now there are other things.
     I'm just as concerned as you are
     about Simon.

          MELVIN
     Concerned. I'm just the hall
     monitor here.

          FRANK
     It's not only financial
     assistance. What he's got to do
     is go to Baltimore tomorrow and
     ask his parents for money. It's
     not going to happen on the phone.

          MELVIN
     Yeah. If his parents are alive
     they've got to help -- those are
     the rules. Good.

          FRANK
     Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high
     maintenance selling painter coming
     through... So I'm out. Can you
     take him?

          MELVIN
     Think white and get serious.

Carol enters scene.

          FRANK
     Take my car -- a convertible. Do
     you drive?

          MELVIN
       (loudly)
     Like the wind but I'm not doing
     it.

          CAROL
     Getting loud, getting loud.

          MELVIN
     He wants me to take his car and
     his client to Baltimore.

          CAROL
     I want your life for a minute
     where my big problem is someone
     offers me a free convertible so I
     can get out of this city.

She exits. Frank prepares to depart.

          MELVIN
     Okay. I'll take him. Get him
     packed -- ready -- tomorrow
     morning.

Frank stumbles back... self-satisfied, he relaxes.

          MELVIN
       (excited)
     Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow.
     Let's not drag this out. We don't
     enjoy another that much.

          FRANK
     If there's some mental health
     foundation that raises money to
     help people like you be sure to
     let me know.

          MELVIN
     Last word freak.

Frank adjusts and exits... Carol approaches calling a
"good-bye" to him.

          CAROL
     So. Anything else?

          MELVIN
     Yes. I'm going to give my queer
     neighbor a lift to Baltimore.

          CAROL
     Okay.

          MELVIN
     Hey, what I did for you is working
     out?

          CAROL
       (a breath; then)
     What you did changed my life.

She offers him the note.

          MELVIN
     No... no thank you notes.

          CAROL
     Well, part of what I said in this
     entire history of my life which
     you won't read is that somehow
     you've done more for my mother, my
     son and me, than anyone else ever
     has... And that makes you the most
     important, surprising, generous
     person I've ever met and that you
     be in our daily prayers forever.

          MELVIN
     Lovely.

          CAROL
     I also wrote one part... I wrote
     I'm sorry... I was talking about I
     was sorry when I got mad at you
     when you came over and you told my
     son that he ought to answer back
     so I wrote that.
       (reading from the
          letter, Melvin
          wildly uncomfortable)
     I was sorry for busting you on
     that... and I'm sorry for busting
     in on you that night... when I
     said I was never... I was sorry
     and I'm sorry every time your food
     was cold and that you had to wait
     two seconds for a coffee filler...

Melvin wants to disappear but Carol is getting into it --
emotionally moved by her own words.

          CAROL
     ... and I'm sorry for never
     spotting, right there at the table
     in the restaurant, the human being
     that had it in him to do this
     thing for us... You know what, I'm
     just going to start from the
     beginning... I have not been able
     to express my gratefulness to
     you... even as I look at the word
     "grateful" now it doesn't begin to
     tell you what I feel for you...

And finally Carol notes Melvin's mood and pauses.

          MELVIN
     Nice of you... thank you.

          CAROL
     Thank you.

          MELVIN
     Now I want you to do something for me.

She looks at him for a very strange, long beat.

          CAROL
     Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say,
     "what?" I thought I said,
     "what?"... What?

          MELVIN
     I want you to go on this trip.

          CAROL
     No, sir...

          MELVIN
     I can't do this alone. I'm afraid
     he'll pull the stiff one eye on
     me. I need you to chaperon.
     Separate everything but cars. You
     said you liked convertibles. Now
     I'm on the hook.

          CAROL
     The stiff one eye?

          MELVIN
     Two days.

          CAROL
     I can't. I work.

          MELVIN
     You take off when you have to.

          CAROL
     My son.

          MELVIN
     Bettes tells me he's doing fine.

          CAROL
       (no other way)
     Melvin, I'd rather not.

          MELVIN
     What's that got to do with it?

          CAROL
     Funny, I thought it was a strong
     point.

          MELVIN
     Write me a note and ain't she
     sweet. I need a hand and where'd
     she go.

          CAROL
     Are you saying accepting your help
     obligates me!?

          MELVIN
     Is there another way to see it?

          CAROL
     No.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Carol takes an old weekend case down from the top shelf
of the closet.

          CAROL
     Well, here's a little suitcase
     shocked that it's been used.

She holds up a dress -- a pretty one... then decides it's
too pretty and puts it back... Now she looks in another
drawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries
of the ages. She hesitates then talks to herself.

INSERT -- UNDERWEAR DRAWER

Her best underwear neatly stacked alongside her everyday
"girl Jockies." She fingers the good stuff -- puts it
back -- then the everyday -- hesitates.

          CAROL
       (furiously exasperated)
     There's not way to pack for this
     trip... well, I'll tell you -- I'm
     not packing the camera.

As she exits the room --

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

As she picks up the phone.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Melvin is in his bedroom -- everything he's taking neatly
stacked on the bed waiting to be packed (he is taking a
camera). He has a list of what he needs. All items --
underwear, socks, etc... with four checks next to each
one and still he -- checks each stack on the bed and adds
another check. The PHONE RINGS. This is an amazing
development. He has almost no recent experience with
receiving a nighttime phone call. He makes a little
comment to himself as he moves.

          MELVIN
     Woo-woo.

He stops -- briefly trying to remember where the phone is
-- and then, remembering, crosses and picks it up but
before bringing it to his mouth nervously clears his
throat.

ON CAROL

As she hears his throat being cleared. It is not a
pretty sound. (The following conversation is INTERCUT.)

          CAROL
     Hello?

          MELVIN
     Are you still coming?

          CAROL
     Yes.

Melvin visibly relaxes.

          CAROL
     Melvin... I'd like to know exactly
     where we are going.

          MELVIN
     Just south to Baltimore, Maryland.
     So I know what you're going to ask
     next.
       (correcting himself)
     That you might ask -- I'm not
     certain.

          CAROL
     There's... there's no need to
     bring anything dressy... or... I
     mean -- I didn't know if we'd be
     eating at any restaurant that
     have dress codes.

          MELVIN
     Oh.
       (a beat)
     We might. Yes. We can. Let's.

          CAROL
     Okay, gotcha. What did you think
     I was going to ask?

          MELVIN
     Whether crabs are in season there
     now...

          CAROL
     Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good
     night.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Beverly looks up expectantly as her daughter enters.

          BEVERLY
     How was it talking to him?

          CAROL
     Stop treating this like I'm going
     away with a man. He's just going
     to say those crappy, sick,
     complaining, angry things to me.
     I hate this, Mom -- I hate this.
     He's a freak show -- the worst
     person I ever met.

          BEVERLY
     Well, maybe he has nice friends.

EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Beverly and Spencer wait with her. The bus approaches.
She kisses them.

          CAROL
       (to Spencer)
     You stand there and I'll wave to
     you from the back window.

As she boards the bus.

          BEVERLY
     Call me as soon as you're settled.

          CAROL
       (to Spencer)
     I love you.

The bus driver closes the doors on her -- she shoves them
open.

          CAROL
       (to bus driver)
     Sensitive, huh?!

The bus pulls out. He runs after the bus -- waving at
his mother who grows concerned that he might be taxing
himself.

INT. VETERINARIAN'S WAITING ROOM - DAY

A female VETERINARIAN in surgical scrubs holds Verdell as
Melvin finishes filling out some forms.

On opposite sides of the waiting room, a very large black
dog and a tiny Chihuahua sit patiently with their owners.

          VETERINARIAN
     Anything unusual in the dog's
     diet?

          MELVIN
     No. Everybody gets their own
     cage?

          VETERINARIAN
     Certainly.

          MELVIN
       (pointing to
          Chihuahua)
     Put him in with that one, not that
     one...
       (pointing to large
          dog)
     ... Builds his confidence.

EXT. BUS STOP NEAR APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY

Carol disembarks.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY

As she walks and turns a corner.

CLOSE ON CAROL

The shot of the prisoner taking the walk toward the death
chamber. But the prisoner -- has grit -- her knees do
not buckle. She does not whimper. No prison "screws"
will have to support her weight. Still, the prospect
couldn't be grimmer.

CAROL'S POV

Melvin next to a spiffy convertible. Top down. Trunk open.

CLOSER ON MELVIN

He is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the
tussle Frank and Simon are having just inside the
building.

          FRANK
     I'm sorry that I'm not taking
     you.

          SIMON
       (upset)
     So am I, Frank.

Frank starts to leave -- Simon stops him. They embrace.

          MELVIN
     Soak it up -- it's your last
     chance at a hug for a few days.

As Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor
changes... that quickly there is a shyness.

          CAROL
     Hi.

          MELVIN
     Thanks for being on time... Carol,
     the waitress, this is Simon, the
     fag.

          CAROL
     Hello... Oh, my God, who did that
     to you?

          SIMON
     I, uh... I was... attacked.
     Walked in on people robbing me. I
     was hospitalized. I almost died.

          MELVIN
     Let's do the small talk in the
     car. Load up.

Carol puts her bag in the car.

          MELVIN
     I was going to do that for you.

          CAROL
       (taken aback)
     It's okay. No problem. Where
     should we sit?

          MELVIN
       (totally non-plussed)
     I -- uh, I... Well, there is no
     place cards or anything.

          CAROL
       (to Simon)
     Let me go in back. You look like
     you need all the room you can
     manage.

          SIMON
     That's very thoughtful.

          MELVIN
     Never a break. Never.

Carol steps into the back. Melvin disappointed that he's
not sitting next to Carol... Carol is wedged in the small
back seat. She struggles to get her feet in.

          MELVIN
     You're really jammed back there.

He reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his
seat and, with some effort,  wrenches it forward giving
Carol more room and putting his right against the wheel.
She is startled by the gesture.

          CAROL
     Thanks, Melvin.

          MELVIN
     Welcome.

And off they go. Simon and Carol stunned by the manners.

EXT. 12TH STREET

Turning onto Fifth.

          MELVIN
     I got the whole ride programmed.

CAMERA FOLLOWS as Melvin goes to a rack of CDs -- all
carefully labelled. He selects and begins to play the
one marked "ICEBREAKER." It is a song which we clearly
and quickly judge as off the circumstances -- a quick
burst of "Y.M.C.A." Melvin STOPS the MUSIC and chuckles.

          MELVIN
     Just wanted to see what you'd do.
     No, we have greatness here.

He goes for another CD labelled "FOR USE TO REP THINGS
UP."

The car turns onto Seventh as we hear BEAUTIFULLY
SELECTED MUSIC.

          CAROL (O.S.)
     Hey, I like this music.

And, as the MUSIC PLAYS, Simon looks out.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

The three of them... Carol chattering away.

          CAROL
     I don't know the last time I've
     been out of the city... Hey, my
     arms are tanning. I used to tan
     great. We gotta stop soon so'se
     I can check on Spencer.

          SIMON
       (during the above)
     I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I
     can't turn my head all the way
     yet... tell her we can't hear her.

          MELVIN
     Doesn't matter. She's enjoying
     herself. Consider it part of the
     music.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

A short time later. Carol is now driving.

          CAROL
     I'm sure, Simon, they did
     something real off for you to feel
     this way... But when it comes to
     your partners -- or your kid --
     things will always be off for you
     unless you set it straight. Maybe
     this thing happened to you just to
     give you that chance.

          MELVIN
     Nonsense!

          CAROL
     Anybody here who's interested in
     what Melvin has to say raise their
     hands.

Simon does not raise his hand. Simon and Carol have thus
declared their majority.

          SIMON
     Do you want to know what happened
     with my parents?

          CAROL
     Yes. I really would.

          SIMON
     Well...

          CAROL
     No, let me pull over so I can pay
     full attention.

Car pulling over toward parking spot.

EXT. HIGHWAY - CURBSIDE - CONVERTIBLE - DAY

She takes the car curbside and parks.

          CAROL
     Now go ahead.

Simon looks back at Melvin as does Carol. He looks
innocent. Several beats -- Melvin almost says something
-- a hidden hand gesture from Carol stops him. Finally.

          SIMON
     Well, I always painted. Always.
     And my mother always encouraged
     it. She was sort of fabulous
     about it actually... and she used
     to... I was too young to think
     there was anything at all wrong
     with it... and she was very
     natural. She used to pose nude
     for me... and I thought or assumed
     my father was aware of it.

          MELVIN
     This stuff is pointless.

          CAROL
     Hey -- you let him...

          MELVIN
     You like sad stories -- you want
     mine.

          CARL
     . Go ahead, Simon. Really.
     Please. Don't let him stop you. Ignore him.

          SIMON
     Okay. Well, one day my father
     came in on one of those painting
     sessions when I was nine -- and he
     just started screaming at her --
     at us -- at evil. And...

          MELVIN
       (very quickly)
... my father didn't leave his
room for 11 years -- he hit my
hand with a yardstick if I made a
mistake on the piano.

          CAROL
     Go ahead, Simon. Your father
     walked in on you and was yelling
     and... really, come on.

          SIMON
     I was trying to defend my mother
     and make peace, in the lamest way.
     I said, "she's not naked -- it's
     art." And then he started hitting
     me. And he beat me unconscious.
     After that he talked to me less
     and less -- he knew before I left
     for college, my dad came into my
     room. He held out his hand. It
     was filled with money. A big wad
     of sweaty money.
       (gathers himself)
     And he said to me, "I don't want
     you to ever come back." I grabbed
     him and I hugged him... He turns
     and walked out.

Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as
strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so
much more complicated than her meat and potatoes
troubles. She looks out her window -- then kisses her
fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek. A nice,
understated, gesture of friendship.

          CAROL
     Well, you know -- I still stay
     what I said. You've got to get
     past it all when it comes to your
     parents. We all have these horror
     stories to get over.

Melvin shifts INTO the FRAME.

          MELVIN
     That's not true. Some of us have
     great stories... pretty stories
     that take place at lakes with
     boats and friends and noodle
     salad. Just not anybody in this
     car. But lots of people -- that's
     their story -- good times and
     noodle salad... and that's what
     makes it hard. Not that you had
     it bad but being that pissed that
     so many had it good.

          CAROL
     No.

          SIMON
     Not it at all, really.

          MELVIN
       (a veteran's irony)
     Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to
     the hotel. And if you're lucky
     tomorrow Dad will give you another
     wad of sweaty money.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM/CARL'S ROOM - DAY

          MELVIN
     Two bedrooms and the sofa opens...

Carol is on the phone in the living room -- she hangs up.

          CAROL
       (to Simon)
     No answer... Maybe we should just
     drive there tomorrow. Can I have
     that one?

          MELVIN
     Yes... sure.
       (to Simon)
     I'll take the sofa.

Carol walks into her room -- the nicest room she'll ever
have slept in... She goes to the phone and dials...

          CAROL
       (into phone)
     Hello... Hi, Spencer... Why are
     you out of breath? You did?!?
     That is great... So great... So --
     no, wait a second, Spence...

INT. HOTEL SUITE - MELVIN AND SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Melvin watches Simon struggle to unpack his especially
neat suitcase. Melvin is uncomfortable.

          MELVIN
     Can I ask you a personal question?

Simon laughs loudly in apprehension squared.

          MELVIN
     Do you ever get an erection for a
     woman?

          SIMON
     Melvin...

          MELVIN
     Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier
     if you were not...

          SIMON
     You consider your life easy.

          MELVIN
     I give you that one...
       (eyes suitcase)
     Nice packing.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Carol enters the common living room... Melvin is sitting
there. Carol is dealing with a number of unsettling new
factors in her life.

          CAROL
     My son was outside playing soccer.
     I never saw him playing ball. Come
     on, you guys -- take me out for a
     good time... Take me out dancing.

          MELVIN
     Dancing?

          SIMON
     I can't, I'm exhausted.

Carol walks to Simon and puts an arm on him. Melvin is
visibly disturbed by her gesture.

          CAROL
       (to Simon)
     I don't blame you... This is a
     monumental first day out... You
     sad or anything?

          SIMON
     No... Nervous. It would be very
     rough, Carol, if you weren't
     along.

          CAROL
     What a nice compliment.

She gives Simon a kiss... Melvin deals with jealousy.
She turns to him.

          CAROL
     I'm happy. And you're my date.
     Let's get dressed.

She exits the room. Melvin unnerved.

          MELVIN
     I'm going to jump in the shower.
     I'll be right with you.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

As Carol, dressed in a thrift shop find, enters the main
room of the suite and hears the SHOWER running -- she
sits down to wait -- through...

SERIES OF DISSOLVES

Showing the enormous length of time which transpires until
finally a seriously clean Melvin emerges from the bathroom
through a cloud of steam. They exit.

EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

As they drive up.

          VALET
     Good evening, sir.

          MELVIN
     They sell hard shell crabs here?

          VALET
     Yes.

INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

As they enters...

          HEAD WAITER
     Good evening.

          MELVIN
     Hi. You have hard shells, right?

          CAROL
     Stop asking everyone.

          MELVIN
     Just him and that's it. Okay, you
     can answer -- we've worked it out.

          HEAD WAITER
     Yes, we do... And I can give you a
     tie and jacket.

          MELVIN
     What?

          HEAD WAITER
     They require a tie and jacket but
     we have some available.

He reaches into the coat and check room and withdraws them.

          MELVIN
     No... I'm not wearing that -- and
     just in case you were going to ask
     I'm not going to let you inject me
     with plaque either.

          CAROL
     You promised a nice place -- can't
     you just...
       (to Head Waiter)
     You have these dry cleaned all the
     time, don't you?

          HEAD WAITER
     Actually, I don't think so.

          MELVIN
       (to Carol)
     Wait here.

EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

As Melvin takes his car back from the valet.

EXT. STREET - SHOPPING MALL - NIGHT

As the car goes right across the street to a shopping
mall.

INT. SHOPPING MALL - MEN'S STORE - NIGHT

Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly.

          SALESMAN
     Good evening.

          MELVIN
     I need a coat and tie.

OTHER ANGLE

CAMERA REVEALS that the floor is intricately patterned so
that passage for Melvin is impossible.

          SALESMAN
     Come on in.

          MELVIN
     No.

          SALESMAN
     No?

          MELVIN
       (pointing)
     That jacket and give me a tie.

EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

As he pulls up - a new VALET taking his car.

          VALET #2
     Good evening.

          MELVIN
     You have hard shells?

          VALET #2
     I'm not sure.

          MELVIN
     Everyone else says you do.

          VALET #2
     Then I guess we do.

INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT

As he enters, looks for and then spot Carol. She is
having a martini at the bar... Sitting on a stool --
watching COUPLES dance... Happy by herself... Turning
down a MAN who wants to buy her another... And Melvin
watches... Watches his date.

          HEAD WAITER
     Shall I get her for you?

          MELVIN
     No, it's all right. I'll just
     watch.

He enjoys watching her for a few more beats... She turns
-- Melvin makes a "Haul your ass over here" gesture...
and she smiles and walks toward him... A WAITER has
lifted her drink -- placed it on a tray and follows her.
She takes a bit of a slalom course through the tables,
giddy as the MUSIC PLAYS and couples dance in the b.g.
She notices the waiter in her trail.

          CAROL
      (mouthing the words
       to Melvin)
     My drink is following me.

Melvin watches her approach. It is all too exquisite.
He takes a breath -- it doesn't come easily.

          CAROL
     You look s...

She stops herself from saying "sexy," regathers, then...

          CAROL
     You look great.

They arrives at the table. He holds out her chair for her.

          CAROL
     You wanna dance?

          MELVIN
     I've been thinking about that
     since you brought it up before.

          CAROL
       (rising)
     And?

          MELVIN
     No...
       (and before she can
          digest that)
     ... I don't get this place. They
     make me buy an outfit but they let
     you wear a house dress. I don't
     get it.

ON CAROL

Melvin has no idea he has insulted her. Sandbagged in
extreme, she gets up -- actually ready to leave.

          MELVIN
     No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't
     mean it. You gotta sit down. You
     can still give me the dirty
     look... just sit down and give it
     to me.

          CAROL
     Melvin, pay me a compliment... I
     need one and quick... You have no
     idea how much what you said just
     hurt my feelings.

          MELVIN
       (really pissed,
          mutters)
     That monominute somebody gets that
     you need them they threaten to go
     away. Never fails.

          CAROL
     That's not compliment, Melvin...
     That's just trying to sound smart
     so I feel stupid... A compliment
     is something nice about somebody
     else... Now or never.

          MELVIN
     Okay.

He waves her down.

          CAROL
       (sitting)
     And mean it...

          MELVIN
     Can we order first?

She thinks and then nods. The waiter is across the room.
This does not stop Melvin.

          MELVIN
       (calling)
     Two crab dinners and pitcher of
     cold beer.
       (to Carol)
     Baked or fries?

          CAROL
     Fries.

          MELVIN
       (calling)
     One baked -- one fries.

          STARTLED WAITER
       (shouting back)
     I'll tell your waiter.

          MELVIN
       (to Carol)
     Okay, I got a real great
     compliment for you and it's true.

          CAROL
     I am so afraid you're about to say
     something awful...

          MELVIN
     Don't be pessimistic. It's not
     your style. Okay... Here I
     goes... Clearly a mistake.
       (this is hell
          for him)
     I have this -- what? Ailment...
     And my doctor -- a shrink... who
     I used to see all the time... he
     says 50 or 60 percent of the time
     a pill can really help. I hate
     pills. Very dangerous things,
     pills. "Hate," I am using the
     word "hate" about pills. My
     compliment is that when you came
     to my house that time and told me
     how you'd never -- well, you were
     there, you know... The next
     morning I started taking these
     pills.

          CAROL
       (a little confused)
     I don't quite get how that's a
     compliment for me.

Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion --
so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly --
then:

          MELVIN
     You make me want to be a better
     man.

Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so
slip under her guard. She stumbles a bit -- flattered,
momentarily moved and his for the taking.

          CAROL
     That's maybe the best compliment
     of my life.

          MELVIN
     Then I've really overshot here
     'cause I was aiming at just enough
     to keep you from walking out.

Carol laughs.

          CAROL
     So how are you doing with those
     pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.

          MELVIN
     Takes months to know... They work
     little by little.
       (holds his head;
          then)
     Talking like this is exhausting.

Carol moves to the chair next to him... She sits very
close -- he tenses.

          CAROL
     Have you ever let a romantic
     moment make you do something you
     know is stupid?

          MELVIN
     Never.

          CAROL
     Here's the trouble with never.

TIGHT SHOT

for the kiss. Their faces are close -- she looks at
him... She closes her eyes -- her face moving toward him
-- he is wide-eyed and afraid... His face almost moves
away -- in a shot this close it's almost flight... But
now his head moves back and he receives her kiss. It is
brief. Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself.
Melvin can't bear the pleasure.

          MELVIN
     You don't owe me that.

          CAROL
     That wasn't payment. When you
     first came into breakfast, when I
     saw you -- I thought you were
     handsome... Then, of course, you
     spoke... So now that your soft
     li'l underbelly is all exposed.
     Tell me, why did you bring me?

Melvin's voice is soft -- hesitant, okay, vulnerable...
as he holds up his hands in a "stop" signal.

          MELVIN
     Well, ah... that's a personal
     question.

          CAROL
     Tell me even if you're scared.
     Tell me why you wanted me here.
     It's okay.

She kisses him again.

          CAROL
     If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."

          MELVIN
       (dissembling)
     There are lots of reason... I had
     a thought that if you had sex with
     Simon it might...

          CAROL
       (humiliated)
     Sex with Simon?

          MELVIN
     It's one idea...

          CAROL
     That's why you brought me? Look
     at me! Is that really why you
     brought me... Like I'm a what and
     I owe you what?!

          MELVIN
     I don't know why I brought you --
     that idea occurred to me is all...
     It came out first... Hey, you kiss
     him -- me... He says he loves
     you. You two hit it off. But you
     don't want to... fine... Forget
     what I said about sex with Simon.
     It was a mistake.

          CAROL
       (wiping away tears)
     I'll never forget you said it.

          MELVIN
     It was a mistake.

But she has already turned away and exits the
restaurant... Melvin alone and miserable.

INT. SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

He finishes dialing. He is extremely tense -- not
breathing -- a lump in his throat -- trying not to let
the anxiety immobilize him... the NUMBER RINGS twice,
then a humorless male voice:

          PARENTS' VOICE
       (humorless male
          voice)
     Hi. This is Fred Bishop...
       (perky woman's
          voice)
     ... and Betty.
       (Fred again)
     We are sorry to be unable to take
     your call right now. Please leave
     a message and we'd appreciate your
     including the time/date and
     purpose of your call.
       (Simon mouths the
          word "date," then
          Betty speaks before
          the beep Bye-bye.

          SIMON
     Ah, this is Simon... I'm here in
     town...
       (he waits)
     ... and, folks, you haven't come
     home later than 10 in your lives.
     Please pick up -- really...
     Okay... I'm going to call again in
     the morning. I need to see you.
     Or, at least get you to answer the
     phone.

He hangs up. His parents want no part of him and he
needs help.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - CAROL'S ROOM - NIGHT

As Carol enters with some energy. We FOLLOW her as she
goes into her room -- takes her suitcase, begins throwing
things in.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - NIGHT

          SIMON
     Hello... Hello???

Carol thrusts open the door and enters...

          SIMON
     Was this supposed to be your room?

          CAROL
     Our room. I don't want to see him
     and he's not going to come
     knocking on your door.

Simon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him,
inadvertently venting some anger as she does so.

          SIMON
     Can you not be violent?

          CAROL
     I don't think so. You need help
     with the pants?

          SIMON
       (emphatically)
     No!!!

          CAROL
     I'm going to take a big bath and
     order a big meal.

          SIMON
     Uh-huh...

          CAROL
     I'm sorry... are you okay?

          SIMON
     Well, considering everything's
     horrible and tomorrow I have to
     face my parents... Don't ask me
     ... I'm sick of my own complaints
     ... got to get me a new set of
     thoughts.

          CAROL
     Why? What have you been thinking
     about?

          SIMON
     How to die, mostly.

          CAROL
     Can you believe in our little mix
     you're the good roommate.

Simon laughs -- as she crosses to the bathroom and begins
to prepare a bath.

          SIMON
       (turning off the light)
     Good night.

          CAROL
     Good night.

We are ON Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or
sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he
faces the bathroom and we have...

SIMON'S POV

Carol sitting at tub's edge -- a towel around her and now
as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair
-- the towel falls -- a better than perfect breast
exposed...

BACK TO SCENE

          SIMON
       (a whisper)
     Hold it.

He leaves the bed.

ANGLES ON HOTEL DESK

What's he up to... he takes the blotter from the desk set
and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair
and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of
the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol.

          SIMON
     I've got to sketch you.

          CAROL
     No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer
     than you think. I give the wrong
     impression sometimes and...

          SIMON
     I haven't even been thinking about
     sketching for weeks.

          CAROL
     Stop staring. Do a vase.

          SIMON
     But you're beautiful... your skin
     glows.

          CAROL
     Thanks. But I just want to take a
     bath and...

          SIMON
     That long neck -- the line of
     you... you're porcelain... your
     back goes on forever. You're
     classic... you're why cavemen
     chiseled on walls...

          CAROL
     All right, cut me a break.

Simon's pen moves across the blotter -- Carol sees him
earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly
but deliberately she lowers the towel. He's right.
She's breathtaking.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink. He's been talking to
the bartender.

          MELVIN
     So then, the next thing I know,
     she's sitting right next to me,
     and then, well, it's not right to
     go into the details, but I screwed
     up. I got nervous. I said the
     wrong thing and if I hadn't, I
     could be in bed now with a woman
     who if you could make her smile
     you got a life. Instead, I'm here
     with you, no offense, a moron
     pushing the last legal drug.

He sits there, just another Joe on a bar stool with his
heart breaking.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - CLOSE ON SIMON - NIGHT

He's excited -- smiling... We hear Carol -- also revved.

          CAROL (O.S.)
     I don't care how you put it --
     We're being naughty here, pal.

FULL SHOT

Carol holding a pose for Simon... He is holding a
ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter. His
style cramped by his cast.

          SIMON
     No. No. This is great, this is
     so great. I can't get the angle
     with this cast.

He struggles with the cast, and then decides to struggle
no more. Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece
from the cast, freeing his hand -- he roars ironically --
a lion's roar of liberation. He is back at his center.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Melvin is having a room service breakfast.

The door opens... Simon enters. A new Simon -- better
than ever, clearly happy -- a morning-after glow.

          MELVIN
     Did you have sex with her?

Carol follows his out. Her arms are filled with the
hotel soaps, shampoos, etc.

          MELVIN
     Sorry, didn't realize she was
     right there.
       (a beat)
     Did you have sex with her?

          CAROL
     To hell with sex.

Carol looks at Melvin -- he can't meet her gaze.

          CAROL
     We held each other. It was better
     than sex. What I need he gave me
     great.

          SIMON
     I just love her.
       (beat)
     How're you doing?

Melvin reacts.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

Simon finishes dialing the phone... a brief wait, then:

          SIMON
     Hello, hi, Mom -- I can barely
     hear you. Do you have to whisper?
     No -- don't apologize -- it was
     the luckiest thing for all of us
     that you didn't answer last
     night... I can't hear you... okay,
     dear, just listen to me then.

ON MELVIN AND CAROL

Melvin has been reduced to straight talk as Carol brings
the bathroom bounty into the room and begins to put it in
her suitcase.

          MELVIN
     I get why you're angry. It's no
     snap to explain why I was like
     that, but let's not try to do it
     on the run...

          SIMON
     ... so Mom. Truly no grudges --
     truly. A little odd that you
     didn't come to see me when you
     heard I was hurt, but the
     important thing I want you to know
     is your son is happy. I'm working
     again. I'll make do -- I don't
     want a thing. Wouldn't take it if
     it was offered. I'll drop you a
     note from wherever I land and then
     it's up to you. I hope we patch
     things up but know that if we
     don't, I wish you both the very
     best... I can't hear you. You
     heard me, though, right? Good --
     take good care. 'Bye.

He hangs up, totally satisfied with himself and rips over
to Carol and Melvin.

          MELVIN
     ... Now he's going to want to
     stay. And they'll want to take a
     ride to the lake or whatever. So
     it's a good five hours back. It
     gives us a chance to take it easy
     and...

          SIMON
     I'm going back with you.

          CAROL
     But what about...

          SIMON
     I'll take care of myself --

          MELVIN
     What are you talking about? You
     got real problems.

          SIMON
     I know. I'm a little bit nervous.
     Suddenly everything seems so easy.
     Carol, a load has been lifted.

          CAROL
     One night with me!

          SIMON
     You think you're kidding.

Melvin stalks out.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The car parked near a phone booth --

          MELVIN
       (to Frank over
          the phone)
     Aww Jesus! No choice.

Carol walks up to Simon in the car.

          CAROL
     I got a gift for you.

She hands him a base ball cap.

          MELVIN
       (on phone)
     Nothing like no choice to make you
     feel at home.

          CAROL
       (to Simon)
     Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!

          MELVIN
     Do it then. Get the dog picked
     up. I can't believe you let it
     stay there.

Melvin hangs up the phone.

          MELVIN
     Good-bye.
       (to Simon)
     Well, your luck is holding. They
     sublet your place. You're
     homeless. Frank's got a line on
     another place you can use for now.

          SIMON
     Another place where?

          MELVIN
     Does it matter?

Melvin gets in -- goes to the glove compartment for a
special CD labelled "For Emergency Use Only." As it
PLAYS a confessional love SONGS:

          CAROL
     I don't want to hear that music
     right now.

          MELVIN
     What do you mean? You said you
     liked it.

          CAROL
     I don't.

          MELVIN
     This one has a special meaning.

          CAROL
     It's your car but I don't want to
     hear it. If that means anything.

Melvin hesitates and then turns OFF the SONG in mid-
proclamation of love.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - NIGHT

As the car arrives... They get out...

          MELVIN
     Here are the keys to my apartment.
     I'm going to park you in my place
     while I take Carol home.

          CAROL
       (hefting bag)
     I'll take a bus.

           MELVIN
     I'll take you... why not?

          CAROL
     I don't care what you did for me.
     I don't think I want to know you
     anymore -- all you do is make me
     feel badly about myself.
       (turning to Simon)
     You have my number.

          SIMON
       (hugging her)
     I love you...
       (sotto)
     Let him take you home.

          CAROL
     Don't want to. I love you.

She shakes her head and walks off. Simon looking at
Melvin with some sympathy.

          MELVIN
     Don't say anything.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Where Verdell's ears prick.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

As they enter.

          MELVIN (O.S.)
     I told you to go on in.

          SIMON (O.S.)
     Look, I've got to get a hold of
     Frank and see where I'm hanging my
     hat 'cause...

The door opens, revealing them:

          MELVIN
     I think you gotta camp it here...

          SIMON
     What are you talking about?

The dog vaults toward them -- all else forgotten as the
dog greets his two favorite people and they talk to him.

          SIMON
       (to Verdell)
     I know the feeling -- you feel
     like your ol' self again, huh? --
     Mommy and Daddy are home.

Melvin reacts.

          SIMON
     Sorry... You're fun to mess with.

Melvin gets up... Simon notices some of his paintings.

          MELVIN
     They took your place furnished.
     Jackie said she grabbed your
     personal stuff -- they were
     supposed to set you up here.
       (leading the way)
     There's this extra room -- I
     never use. It gets good light.
     No other answer really.

Simon follows.

INT. SIMON'S NEW ROOM - NIGHT

As they enter... the room clean and organized -- a small
but lovely garret.

          SIMON
     Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm
     me.

          MELVIN
     They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?

          SIMON
     I love you.

Melvin looks at him finally -- pretensions fall.

          MELVIN
 I'll tell you, buddy, I'd be the
 luckiest guy alive if that did it
 for me.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As Carol unpacks, she gives gifts to her mother and
Spencer. But clearly something gnaws at her psyche.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart... each
around 1:55 a.m... He sits in a chair still fully
dressed... forlorn... Verdell in his lap. A beat then we
hear Simon's whispered voice.

          SIMON (O.S.)
     Where is my big hairy boy?

Melvin is alarmed. He stops breathing as his gay houseguest
approaches.

          SIMON (O.S.)
     Verdell, sweeties?

Melvin breathes again. Simon enters the room.

          SIMON
     Sorry, didn't know you were awake.
     I just thought Verdell shouldn't
     get too used to sleeping in here
     'cause then...

          MELVIN
     Look, we both want the dog --
     and...

The PHONE RINGS... they look at each other. Melvin
doesn't move.

          SIMON
     Should I get it?

Melvin nods. Simon walks into the next room... several
beats as he finds the phone. We hear him pick it up and:

          SIMON (O.S.)
     Hello.

ON SIMON

          SIMON
       (into phone)
     Hello. It's me. He took me in.
     Did you know? Hold on, I'll get
     him for you.

He walks back to Melvin's room.

INT. MELVIN'S ROOM - NIGHT

As he enters.

          SIMON
     It's Carol.

Melvin is quickly out of his chair -- the dog in one
mitt... he thrusts it at Simon.

          MELVIN
     Here. Take the dog.

As he speeds him out...

          SIMON
     Good luck.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

As Melvin picks up the phone... He clears his throat
loudly. Following is INTERCUT between Carol and Melvin
-- the first such CUT showing Carol blasted by the throat
clearing.

          MELVIN
     Hello.

          CAROL
     Yeah... Well...

          MELVIN
       (very concerned)
     How you doing?

          CAROL
     I can trust my brain.

          MELVIN
     That seems like a good choice.

          CAROL
     I don't know whether I'm being
     sensible or hard on you.

          MELVIN
     The two might go together.

          CAROL
     See. There's an example. I don't
     know whether you're being cute or
     crazy now.

          MELVIN
       (what the hell)
     Cute.

          CAROL
     You don't have to answer
     everything I say. Just listen to
     me. Okay?

He nods his head, "yes."

          CAROL
     It's really something that you're
     looking after Simon. And what I
     said on the street. That was a
     bad thing to say. And it made me
     sick to my stomach. It was a bad
     thing to say. And I'd be lying if
     I didn't say that I enjoyed your
     company... but the truth is you do
     bother me enormously and I know --
     think -- that it's best for me to
     not have contact with you because
     you're just not ready and you're a
     pretty old guy to not be ready...
     and I'm too old to ignore that.
     But there were extraordinary
     kindnesses that did take place.
     So thanks for the trips...

She's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than
ever. It's hard to know whether to die or not.

          MELVIN
     Okay to say something now?

          CAROL
     Go ahead.

          MELVIN
     I should've danced with you.

          CAROL
     Okay. Good-bye.

          MELVIN
     So long.

Carol hangs up. She feels strange. A shoe hasn't dropped.
Oh, hell... she missed him.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room. He
is impatient.

          MELVIN
     You going to come talk to me or
     not?

          SIMON
     I'm coming.

We enters the room carrying Verdell who strains to be
allowed closer to Melvin. Simon releases him.

          SIMON
     What did she say?

          MELVIN
     I'm a great guy --
     "extraordinary"...
       (before Simon can
          celebrate)
     ... and she doesn't want contact
     with me.
       (a beat)
     I'm dying here.

          SIMON
     Because...
       (gently)
     ... you love her?

          MELVIN
       (sharply)
     No... and you're supposed to be
     sensitive and sharp.

          SIMON
     Okay... you tell me why --
       (mimics him)
     "You're dying here."

          MELVIN
     I don't know... Let me sleep on it
     and figure it out.
       (then)
     Because I'm stuck! Can't go back
     to what I had... She's evicted me
     from my life.

          SIMON
     Did you like it that much?

          MELVIN
       (furiously)
     It was better than this... Look,
     you, I'm very intelligent. If
     you're going to give me advice or
     conversation or consolation or
     hope, you got to be better than
     you're doing. If you can't be at
     least momentarily interesting than
     shut the hell up. I'm drowning
     and you're describing water.

          SIMON
       (getting pissed)
     Picking on me won't help.

          MELVIN
     Well, if that's true then I'm
     really in trouble.

          SIMON
     But you know where you're lucky?

          MELVIN
     Absolutely not.

          SIMON
     You know who you want. I'll take
     your seat any day. So do
     something... don't sleep on it...
     go over there. I don't think
     anybody should ever sleep on
     anything -- it's not always good
     to let things calm down.

          MELVIN
     Hey... I'm charged here. But she
     might kill me for showing up this
     late.

          SIMON
     Then get in your jammies and I'll
     read you a story... I think you've
     got a chance. The only real enemy
     you have is her ability to think
     logically -- the best thing you
     have going for you is your
     willingness to humiliate yourself
     if it gives you one chance in
     whatever -- so go catch her off-
     guard.

          MELVIN
     Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.

He moves for the door... stops suddenly, jolted.

          SIMON
     What's wrong?

          MELVIN
     I forgot to lock the door.

EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING (CAROL'S NEIGHBORHOOD) -
NIGHT

As he parks. He exits the car -- now wary... looks at
his watch... hesitates... walks reluctantly into the
apartment house.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

As Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great
uncertainty.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Carol in a cotton wrap-around dress/bathrobe... sitting
directly in front of a fan... the windows open, reading
one of Melvin's books...

There is the briefest possible sound of a DOORBELL...
someone has jabbed her downstairs button ever so briefly
-- so briefly that she's not certain it's her DOORBELL --
until the same brief sound REPEATED... She walks to
her wide open window and looks over.

HER POV

The convertible at the curb.

BACK TO SCENE

She hesitates --

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

As Melvin gives up and starts out... turning as the
sudden blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds.
He bolts for the door and enters.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She opens the door... she hears the sound of MELVIN
SOUNDING HEAVILY up the stairs... He reaches her side.

          CAROL
     What do you want, Melvin?

          MELVIN
     Were you asleep?

          CAROL
     What do you want?

          MELVIN
     'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm
     sorry. And you could be grouchy.

          CAROL
     Grouchy?

          MELVIN
     ... 'Cause of being woken up, and
     it would make my job impossible.
     So then I wouldn't even try.

          CAROL
     What job?

          MELVIN
     Were you asleep?

          CAROL
     What are you doing here?

ANOTHER ANGLE

Beverly in the hallway looking on --

BACK TO SCENE

          MELVIN
     I'm sorry I woke you -- some other
     time.

He half turns to leave.

          CAROL
     I wasn't asleep!!

          MELVIN
     What a break...

          CAROL
       (losing it a bit)
     Is it a secret what you're doing
     here?

          MELVIN
     I had to see you...

          CAROL
     Because...

          MELVIN
     It relaxes me... I'd feel better
     just sitting on the curb in front
     of your house than anyplace else
     I can think of or imagine.

Carol has not ever heard anything like that before...
it's sort of sexy in its sincerity.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As we see in the b.g. that Beverly, standing near her
door down the hallway, has heard at least this last
part...

Melvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone...

          MELVIN
       (serious)
     Wait a minute, I'm overstating
     here, maybe the inside stairs. I
     don't want to sit with my feet in
     the gutter. What does that serve?
     It only...

But suddenly Carl is shouting to the heavens.

          CAROL
     Stop it!! Why can't I have a
     normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out
     of here. Just a regular boyfriend
     who doesn't go nuts on me...

          BEVERLY
       (butting in)
     Everybody wants that, dear -- it
     doesn't exit...
       (as Carol turns
          to her)
     Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.

She disappears into her room. Carol snorts a laugh --
gathers herself. A beat.

          MELVIN
       (hopefully)
     Boyfriend?

          CAROL
     Oh, come on in and try not to ruin
     everything by being you.

          MELVIN
     Maybe we could live without the
     wise cracks.

She looks at him -- then:

          CAROL
     Maybe we could...

Melvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carol's kitchen
linoleum and stalls at the door.

          MELVIN
     It feels a little confined here.
     Let's take a walk.

          CAROL
     See. It's four in the morning. A
     walk sounds a little screwy to me,
     if you don't mind.

          MELVIN
     If you need an excuse, there's a
     bakery on the corner. There's a
     shot it'll open soon -- that way
     we're not screwy -- we're just
     two people who like warm rolls.

          CAROL
     Okay.

EXT. STREET - NEAR BAKERY - NIGHT

They walk quietly -- Melvin still walking with his usual
attention to where he steps.

CAROL'S POV

Melvin walking -- and though we can see an improvement --
it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids
stepping on the lines.

BACK TO SCENE

Carol sighs. It is the sound of possibilities crashing
down. Melvin looks at her -- embarrassed, self-conscious
-- his habits making him appear unworthy.

          CAROL
      (gently; almost
       lovingly)
     I'm sorry, Melvin -- but whatever
     this is -- is not going to work.

ON MELVIN

He takes this hard. It forces him to half-whisper
something he hasn't at all said to himself... given his
history... this is an extraordinary intimacy.

          MELVIN
     I'm feeling... I've been feeling
     better.

          CAROL
     Melvin, even though it may seem
     that way now -- you don't know me
     all that well...
       (as he scoffs)
     I'm not the answer for you.

She starts to turn. He tugs at her arm. As she turns
back to him.

          MELVIN
     Hey, I've got a great compliment
     for you.

          CAROL
     You know what? I...

          MELVIN
     Just let me talk.
       (gathers himself
          with uncertainty,
          then:)
     I'm the only one on the face of
     the earth who realizes that you're
     the greatest woman on earth. I'm
     the only one who appreciates how
     amazing you are in every single
     thing you do -- in every single
     thought you have... in how you
     are with Spencer -- Spence...
       (he has reached
          her)
     ... in how you say what you mean
     and how you almost always mean
     something that's all about being
     straight and good...

ON CAROL

She stands on the precipice of being transported away
from the logic which has been her lifeline.

          MELVIN
     I think most people miss that
     about you and I watch wondering
     how they can watch you bring them
     food and clear their dishes and
     never get that they have just met
     the greatest woman alive... And
     the fact that I get it makes me
     feel great... about me!
       (a real question
          filled with
          concern for her)
     You got a real good reason to walk
     out on that?

That last question clearly a true question, not the least
rhetorical -- she considers her answer, then:

          CAROL
     No! It's certainly not. No -- I
     don't think so. No.

          MELVIN
       (tentatively)
     I'm gonna grab you.
       (with conviction)
     I didn't mean it to be a question.
     I'm gonna grab you.

He kisses her. An awkward bomb of a kiss. They separate.
A tense beat. Then:

          MELVIN
     I know I can do better.

They embrace again. He does indeed do much better. A
first-class smooch. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to see his foot
land squarely on a crack in the sidewalk without his
knowledge. They break -- look at each other without a
notion of where to take it from here, and the ALMOST in
unison begin to walk away FROM CAMERA, Melvin following a
path that avoids cracks. Suddenly the lights of the
bakery turn on as it opens for business.

          CAROL
     Warm rolls...

They walk to the bakery, Melvin avoiding the cracks. As
they enter the bakery, a WORKER moves toward them to
clean the entranceway. Melvin, forced to step back onto
a crack, this time notices -- registers the momentous
fact and joins Carol inside as we:

                     FADE OUT
