                         crashes in a fireball. Followed by newsboys 
                         hawking special editions, people on

                         Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something 
                         about the newspapers.

                         locate the lucky man. When I do, it's 
                         your job to keep the newspapers away 
                         from him.

                         of freight are being loaded. Cedar, 
                         Cobb and Anderson stand in front of 
                         a welcome sign. The three obviously 
                         are out of their element here - obviously 
                         "City folks."
                                      
                         Over their shoulders. We hear Cobb's 
                         voice as he reads:

                         Where the scenery enthralls -
                                     
                         Where no hardship e'er befalls -

                         Cobb and Cedar exchange glances.

                         Are you sure this is the town he lives 
                         in?

                         Yes sir, Mr. Cedar. This is the town 
                         all right.

                         Well, I dropped everything at the office 
                         - I hope it's not a wild goose chase.

                         No, sir. We checked it thoroughly. He 
                         lives here all right.

                         Ah! I spy a native. Let's ask him.
 
                                                              
                         CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they cross 
                         to a small, one-story old brick building, 
                         covered with ivy. This is the ticket 
                         and freight office combined. In front 
                         of it is a very old man, a stoop-

                         shouldered rail agent with a face of 
                         a million wrinkles - puttering around 
                         some packages.

                         He picks up a package and disappears 
                         into the building. Cedar and Cobb look 
                         at each other.

                         That's an excellent start. At least 
                         we've broken the ice.
                                      
                         The old man returns to his pile of packages.

                         He again disappears.

                         The old man shows up again.

                         We'd like to get in touch with him. 
                         It's very important.

                         Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. 
                         You won't have no trouble at all. Talk

                         Whereupon the old man carries another 
                         package inside. Cobb is properly exasperated 
                         now.

                         The old man emerges from the building 
                         and looks up at them as if he's never 
                         seen them before.

                         Cobb grabs the old man as he turns to 
                         head back into the building.

                         He turns again - but Cobb holds him 
                         by the arm and sets him down on a small 
                         packing case.

                         didn't you say so in the first place 
                         instead of beating around the bush? 
                         Those other fellows don't know what 
                         they're talking about.

                         Come on, I'll take you there in my car. 
                         If they'd only explained to me what

                         Longfellow crosses to his tuba near 
                         a chair. He takes a mouthpiece out of 
                         his pocket.

                         Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. 
                         I never saw him, but my mother's name 
                         was Semple, you know.

                         the taxes, it amounts to something in

                         I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.

                         Who kept Semple away from the mob.

                         No, he's too fussy for that. That's 
                         what's the matter with him. There are

                         I looked everywhere. I even went to 
                         his house. It's locked up.

                         He probably had a change of heart.

                         Cedar glances off.

                         The band has already begun and is now

                         expression comes into Cobb's eyes. He 
                         grabs Cedar by the arm - who glances 
                         in the direction he points.

                         standing on the observation platform,

                         issues from the clerks. A secretary 
                         looks up.

                         The men come to life. Some rise - others

                         of Cedar - tall and athletic. The third 
                         is a small, frightened-looking man. 
                         He is Budington.

                         didn't like me?

                         I told you to be nice to him. Ten years 
                         we've been waiting for that old man 
                         to kick off. And then we were going 
                         to be on Easy Street. Yeah - on Easy 
                         Street!

                         Oh, shut up! It's too late now, and 
                         you're a nuisance!

                         That's just what I'm going to be - a 
                         nuisance. I'm going to be a nuisance 
                         until I get hold of some of that money!

                         The editor stands in front of his desk. 
                         Four of five reporters in front of him 
                         - several photographers. In the b.g., 
                         leaning against the wall near the door, 
                         apparently indifferent, is Babe Bennett. 
                         The editor, Mac, is haranguing them.

                         He's news! Every time he blows his nose, 
                         it's news. A corn-fed bohunk like that 
                         falling into the Semple fortune is hot 
                         copy . . . But it's got to be personal. 
                         It's got to have an angle. What does 
                         he think about? How does it feel to 
                         be a millionaire! Is he going to get 
                         married! What does he think of New York! 
                         Is he smart? Is he dumb? . . . A million 
                         angles!

                         She has a string in her hand which she 
                         keeps flicking, trying to get a knot 
                         into it - in the manner of cowboys with 
                         a rope. Mac's voice continues over scene:

                         You know Corny Cobb. He's keeping him 
                         under lock and key.

                         They scramble to their feet. One of

                         to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if

                         with that sort of thing. He left everything

                         and enjoyed himself. You should do the

                         while ago, wanted to handle my affairs 
                         for nothing too. It puzzles me why these 
                         people all want to work for nothing. 
                         It isn't natural. So I guess I'd better 
                         think about it some more.

                         Mr. Semple, I think it only fitting 
                         that his nephew, Mr. Longfellow Deeds, 
                         should be made our next Chairman. I 
                         therefore nominate him.

                         That's impossible. The opera has never 
                         paid.

                         care to be head of a business that kept 
                         losing money. That wouldn't be common

                         They all stare at Longfellow. Over scene 
                         comes the low wailing cry of a siren, 
                         which increases in volume as it gets 
                         closer to the building.

                         He rushes to the window and peers out. 
                         The others stare unbelievably. The shriek 
                         of the siren finally dies down. Longfellow 
                         turns back.

                         must be something wrong. Maybe you charge 
                         too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. 
                         Maybe lots of things. I don't know.

                         take it up with me at the office.

                         There's only one place you're going, 
                         and that's out the door.
                                      
                         Hallor looks up, surprised.

                         Besides, there's something fishy about 
                         a person who would settle for a million 
                         dollars when they can get seven million. 
                         I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's 
                         supposed to be a smart man, couldn't 
                         see through that.

                         Longfellow stares after him disgustedly, 
                         wiping his hands with his handkerchief.

                         Longfellow, exiting his bedroom, wearing 
                         a coat and hat. He comes to the top 
                         of a grand staircase, looks around slyly 
                         and sees that no one is watching. He 
                         slides down the bannister and touches 
                         the statue at the bottom for good luck.

                         down, lifts her head. We see it is Babe 
                         Bennett. Her eyes are closed, apparently 
                         in a dead faint.

                         so, her eyes open and she looks up at 
                         him, feigning bewilderment.

                         The musician leans into them with romantic 
                         strains.

                         if you went to Mandrake Falls you'd 
                         look just as funny to us . Only nobody 
                         would laugh at you and make you feel 
                         ridiculous - 'cause that wouldn't be 
                         good manners.

                         As he rises, continuing:

                         I guess maybe it is comical to write 
                         poems for postcards, but a lot of people 
                         think they're good. Anyway, it's the 
                         best I can do. So if you'll excuse me, 
                         we'll be leaving. I guess I found out 
                         that all famous people - aren't big 
                         people . . .

                         The group watches him silently as he 
                         leaves the table accompanied by Babe. 
                         For a moment they are nonplussed - then 
                         they break into raucous laughter - all 
                         but Morrow.

                         With Longfellow and Babe as they take 
                         several steps. Then he abruptly stops.

                         There's just one thing more. If it weren't 
                         for Miss Dawson being here with me, 
                         I'd probably bump your heads together.

                         Longfellow stares at her for a moment.

                         He starts back toward the table.

                         Protectively, Brookfield and Henaberry 
                         rise from their chairs. But they are 
                         too late, for Longfellow clips Brookfield 
                         on the chin first with his left fist 
                         - and with his right catches Henaberry 
                         on the jaw. The punches are almost simultaneous. 
                         The surprise attack catches the men 
                         off-guard and they fall backward. A 
                         waiter rushes forward to escort Longfellow 
                         and Babe out.

                         and who has watched Longfellow with 
                         great admiration, now rises to catch 
                         up to him.

                         Babe, who are on their way out. The 
                         waiter is shooing people away.

                         and would fall over backwards a couple 
                         of times in midsentence if the alert

                         Walter leans over the bed violently, 
                         shaking Longfellow, who is lost in drunken 
                         sleep.

                         If you'll permit me to say so, sir, 
                         you were out on quite a bender last 
                         night, sir.

                         Longfellow opens one eye - and then 
                         the other, blinking. As consciousness 
                         returns to him, he glances around the 
                         room as if to get his bearings.

                         Bender? You're wrong, Walter. We started 
                         out to a binge but we never got to it.

                         Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
 
                                                              
                         Longfellow takes it and downs it in 
                         one swig.

                         Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone 
                         number on a piece of paper.

                         Longfellow looks up slowly. Walter goes 
                         on:

                         I did what!

                         As a matter of fact, you came home without 
                         any clothes. You were in your - uh - 
                         shorts. Yes, sir.

                         Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't 
                         walk around in the streets without any 
                         clothes. I'd be arrested.

                         The ones who brought you home, sir. 
                         They said you and another gentleman 
                         kept walking up and down the streets, 
                         shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are 
                         a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"

                         Slowly it is all coming back to him.

                         be a great author, but I think he's 
                         crazy. The man's crazy, Walter.

                         Longfellow slowly swings out of bed 
                         into a sitting position. Walter kneels 
                         to put on Longfellow's slippers. Longfellow 
                         balks, points, silently reminding Walter 
                         that he has broken his promise not to 
                         kneel down in front of him.

                         Longfellow's expression begs no disagreement. 
                         Walter stands, fumbling with the shoes 
                         from a stooped posture.

                         Going through my pockets. You said you

                         Following Walter's exit. Longfellow

                         They keep their eyes glued on the bus

                         One girl has a paper open.

                         They are gone. Longfellow glares after

                         From over their shoulders, looking down

                         He does try. The wind blows it back 
                         on him. She laughs, takes out a handkerchief 
                         and wipes it off his coat.

                         He doesn't say anything right away.

                         they'll go on writing them till they 
                         get tired. You don't believe all that

                         why people seem to get so much pleasure

                         buildings and I got to thinking about 
                         what Thoreau said. They created a lot 
                         of grand palaces here - but they forgot 
                         to create the noblemen to put in them.

                         Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun 
                         there when I was a little girl. I used 
                         to love to go fishing with my father. 
                         That's funny. He was a lot like you, 
                         my father was. Talked like you, too. 
                         Sometimes he'd let me hold the line 
                         while he smoked - and we'd just sit 
                         there for hours. And after awhile, for 
                         no reason, I'd go over and kiss him 
                         and sit in his lap. He never said very 
                         much but once I remember him saying: 
                         "No matter what happens, honey, don't 
                         complain."

                         knowing.
                                      
                         There is a pause while Longfellow watches 
                         her, and she is lost in thought.

                         She starts again, and he sings "Humoresque" 
                         in counterpoint to her drumming.

                         They wait with their camera. When they 
                         hear the singing, they look up, and 
                         then at each other in surprise.

                         I wonder if they'd want to make it a 
                         quartet.

                         Longfellow and Babe. They are having 
                         a grand time with their singing. A policeman 
                         saunters into the scene and stands watching 
                         them for a few seconds, without their 
                         being conscious of his presence. He 
                         smiles, shakes his head and passes on 
                         out of scene. Over the shot we hear 
                         the low moan of a siren in the distance.

                         They reach the climax of their song 
                         - and laugh joyously. At this moment, 
                         the shrieking of the siren is nearer 
                         and louder. Longfellow looks up quickly. 
                         Excited, he jumps up and runs toward 
                         street. Babe looks up, surprised.

                         see how they do it. Wait for me, will 
                         you?

                         They dash by the policeman, who looks 
                         up, startled.

                         As the fire engine slows down - and 
                         people are beginning to gather. We see 
                         Longfellow running toward the truck 
                         and hopping aboard.

                         Several feet away from her Mabel Dawson 
                         stands in front of an easel, working 
                         silently on a painting. She dabs at 
                         it and turning, pauses a moment to watch 
                         Babe, who at the moment rests her forehead 
                         on the typewriter carriage.

                         Babe is too much absorbed to hear this. 
                         Getting no response, Mabel turns and 
                         studies her for a few seconds.

                         Longfellow is in bed in his pajamas, 
                         playing the tuba. Walter enters.

                         Longfellow stops, looking daggers at 
                         him.

                         What do you mean by coming in here when 
                         I'm playing?

                         Walter hurries out. Longfellow jumps 
                         up and chases him down the grand staircase. 
                         Longfellow stops at the top of the stairs, 
                         struck by an idea.

                         Walter halts. Longfellow gives a shout 
                         from the top of the stairs. There is 
                         a discernible echo.

                         Longfellow gives another shout. There 
                         is another echo. He tries it again - 
                         louder. Another echo. It is all very 
                         satisfactory.

                         Why, that's an echo, sir!
                                     
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         You try it.
                                     
                         WALTER

                         Me, sir?
                                     
                         LONGFELLOW

                         Yeah.
                                     
                         Walter gives a bird-like hoot. There 
                         is an echo.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         (firmly)
                                     
                         Louder.
                                     
                         Walter gives a louder hoot. And louder. 
                         Each time, an echo.
                                      
                         A butler in a bathrobe emerges to see 
                         what all the hullabaloo is about. Longfellow 
                         spots him.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         (to butler)
                                     
                         You try it.
                                     
                         BUTLER
                                     
                         Me, sir?
                                     
                         But the butler clearly relishes the 
                         opportunity. He gives a little high-pitched 
                         squeak.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         Louder!
                                     
                         The butler tries it again - much better. 
                         Another man-servant has emerged. Longfellow 
                         points to him.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         You try it!
                                     
                         The man-servant tries it - very raspy, 
                         another tone altogether.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         (waving like a conductor)
                                     
                         All together!
                                     
                         A symphony of hoots, shrieks, barks 
                         and echoes.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         Again!
                                     
                         The household staff do it again.
                                     
                         ? 405 ?
                                     
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         (surveying the scene - then, dramatically)
 
                                                              
                         Let that be a lesson to you.
                                     
                         With that, Longfellow spins on his heel 
                         and returns to his bedroom.
                                      
                         There is a pause. The butler takes command 
                         of the other two.
                                      
                         BUTLER
                                     
                         (gesturing imperiously)
                                     
                         Go back to your room, both of you!
 
                                                              
                         Walter and the man-servant hasten to 
                         exit.
                                      
                         The butler waits until nobody is looking, 
                         then gives one, final hoot. He murmurs 
                         to himself with satisfaction as he exits.

                         Madame Pomponi greets a group of guests. 
                         Ad-lib chatter is heard. From inside 
                         music emanates.

                         So good of you to come.

                         I'm just dying to see the "Cinderella

                         CAMERA MOVES SWIFTLY among groups of 
                         people picking out vignettes of conversation. 
                         Longfellow is the hot topic.
                                      
                         A husband and a wife whispering:
                                     
                         A HUSBAND
                                     
                         Shh! - he may hear you.
                                     
                         A WIFE
                                     
                         Even if he heard you, he wouldn't understand.
 
                                                              
                         A man and a woman gossiping:
                                     
                         A MAN
                                     
                         I hear he still believes in Santa Claus.
 
                                                              
                         A WOMAN
                                     
                         Will he be Santa Claus? That's what 
                         I want to know.
                                      
                         Another man holding forth to two elegantly-dressed 
                         women:
                                      
                         ANOTHER MAN
                                     
                         Have you all got your slippers ready 
                         for the "Cinderella Man"?

                         woman hanging around him.
                                      
                         Two women in evening dress twittering

                         My dear, I hear he can't think unless 
                         he plays his tuba!

                         Babe is listlessly packing her few things 
                         in a small handbag. She slowly and meticulously 
                         folds a silken undergarment, wrapping 
                         it in tissue. Her eyes have a distant 
                         look. Mabel watches her, concerned. 
                         There is a long pause before either 
                         of them speaks.

                         You're a fool, Babe.

                         I just couldn't stand seeing him again.

                         What'll I tell him if he calls up?

                         Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I 
                         got a job in China - some place.
                                      
                         MABEL
                                     
                         You're acting like a school girl.

                         What else can I do? Keeping this up 
                         is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.

                         They are suddenly startled by the boisterous 
                         entrance of Bob and Frank, whose voices 
                         are heard as they barge in.

                         hides her bag - and follows Mabel to 
                         greet them in the living room.

                         They stand - stupefied.

                         She waves her hand back of her, for 
                         them to hide.

                         They duck behind the sofa, CAMERA PANNING 
                         WITH THEM.

                         Longfellow enters. Mabel closes the 
                         door behind him, watching him speculatively. 
                         Longfellow turns to Mabel.

                         Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. 
                         Yes, I've been her sister for a long 
                         time.

                         Is she home?
                                     
                         MABEL

                         They look at each other stupidly - smiling 
                         feebly.

                         Featuring the camera. A hand comes in 
                         from behind the sofa and yanks the camera 
                         out of sight.

                         Mabel and Longfellow still standing, 
                         looking at each other.

                         Oh, Mary? Yes, of course. Well, I don't 
                         know whether she's home or not. I'll 
                         see.
                                      
                         As she turns, Babe appears in doorway.

                         Why there she is! Of course she's home.

                         you over an hour. I thought maybe you'd 
                         forgotten.

                         Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from 
                         seeing you. So I threw them out!

                         Mabel raises her eyebrows.

                         I guess that'll be in the papers tomorrow. 
                         It will give 'em something else to laugh

                         They exit. Mabel sighs relievedly. The 
                         boys jump from their crouching positions.

                         Frank grabs his camera and both bolt 
                         toward the door. Mabel gets there one 
                         step ahead of them, and blocks their 
                         path.

                         their faces.

                         Continuing on them, as they slowly walk 
                         around the block.

                         I just don't fit in around here. I once 
                         had an idea I could do something with 
                         the money, but they kept me so busy 
                         here, I haven't had time to figure it 
                         out. I guess I'll wait till I get back 
                         home.
                                      
                         There is a long pause. Both lost in

                         All my life, I've wanted somebody to 
                         talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always 
                         used to talk to a girl.

                         Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike 
                         a lot through the woods and I'd always 
                         take this girl
                                      
                         ? 412 ?
                                     
                         with me so I could talk to her. I'd 
                         show her my pet trees and things. Sounds 
                         kind of silly but we had a lot of fun 
                         doing it.

                         She was beautiful.
                                     
                         (then moodily)
                                     
                         I haven't married 'cause I've been kinda 
                         waiting. You know, my mother and father 
                         were a great couple. I thought I might 
                         have the same kind of luck. I've always 
                         hoped that some day that imaginary girl 
                         would turn out to be real.
                                      
                         They have arrived back at the front 
                         steps of Babe's home.

                         He now takes the poem out. The paper

                         slowly unfolds it. Just as she is about 
                         to read Longfellow lays a hand on her 
                         arm.

                         She looks into his eyes, but does not 
                         respond. Then she holds the paper up 
                         and begins reading. Longfellow watches

                         Longfellow has started out toward him. 
                         In two long strides, Longfellow has 
                         grabbed Cobb by the shirt-front, ready 
                         to strangle him.

                         With his free hand, he reaches into 
                         his coat pocket. He unrolls a newspaper. 
                         Longfellow shifts his glance over to 
                         the photograph in the newspaper Cobb 
                         holds up, and slowly his grip on Cobb 
                         relaxes. He takes the newspaper.

                         Cobb and Walter watch him sympathetically.

                         hand. It seems to bring him to his senses.

                         he hides his face in his hands and sobs.

                         The man sits, eating. He seriously bends 
                         over his food. Longfellow sits opposite

                         officious-looking men have made their 
                         appearance and wait for him to conclude.

                         A guard sits at a desk near a door, 
                         talking on the telephone.

                         Babe rounds the corner quickly, heading 
                         for the door. The guard hurriedly hangs 
                         up and stands to block her.

                         Longfellow is seated by the far wall, 
                         peering moodily out the window. Cobb 
                         paces about. Suddenly, he wheels on 
                         Longfellow.

                         back and let them railroad you? It's 
                         as pretty a frameup as ever hit this 
                         rotten town! If you'd just let me get

                         Longfellow pays no attention to him.

                         being ready to protect yourself in the 
                         clinches. Cedar's too smart. With the 
                         array of talent he's got lined up against 
                         you - you're cooked!

                         Longfellow is still unresponsive. Cobb 
                         thinks a moment, watching him studiously; 
                         then pleading tenderly:

                         Listen, pal - I know just how you feel. 
                         A blonde in Syracuse put me through 
                         the same paces. I came out with a sour 
                         puss - but full of fight. Come on, you 
                         don't want to lay down now.
                                      
                         Longfellow is still unresponsive.

                         Do you realize what's happening? They're 
                         trying to prove that you're nuts! If 
                         they win the case, they'll shove you 
                         in the bughouse. The moment they accuse 
                         you of it, they have you half licked. 
                         You've got to fight!
                                      
                         Longfellow disregards him and Cobb sighs, 
                         resignedly.

                         to check the door is locked.

                         Cobb, in a troubled frame of mind, doesn't 
                         respond and starts down corridor - CAMERA 
                         TRUCKS WITH HIM. Babe catches up with 
                         him.

                         It is practically full. The few empty 
                         seats are being quickly filled. People 
                         stumble over each other to find a seat. 
                         The judge is not yet at his bench. There 
                         is a general chatter of excitement and 
                         anticipation.

                         Cedar and his assistants arrange their 
                         papers. Two dignified gentlemen, psychiatrists, 
                         await action, arms folded. Near them 
                         is Henry Semple, the complainant, his 
                         nose twitching nervously. By his side 
                         is his wife, sparkling expectantly.

                         From a side door Longfellow enters, 
                         accompanied by his guard. Immediately 
                         the place is astir. As he advances to 
                         a chair in front of a table—

                         Impulsively she starts to rise, but 
                         Mac puts a restraining hand on her.

                         Longfellow turns neither to left nor 
                         right. He is slumped low in his chair, 
                         staring solemnly into space. Cobb breaks 
                         into scene and sits down beside him.

                         The court wishes to warn those present 
                         that it will tolerate no disturbances.

                         Regarding the sanity hearing of Longfellow 
                         Deeds, are you represented by counsel, 
                         Mr. Deeds?

                         Almost imperceptibly, Longfellow shakes 
                         his head no. The Judge looks troubled. 
                         There is a stir in the courtroom.

                         I understand that you have no counsel, 
                         Mr. Deeds. In fact, that you have no 
                         intention of defending any of these 
                         charges. Now, if you wish to change 
                         your mind, the hearing can be postponed.

                         I have before me a series of articles 
                         written by a newspaper woman who was 
                         an eye-witness to his conduct ever since 
                         he came to New York.
                                      
                         CAMERA STOPS on Babe and Mac. Cedar's 
                         voice goes on:

                         She tells how, in the midst of a normal 
                         conversation, he would suddenly begin 
                         playing his tuba. She tells of his attacks 
                         upon several of our eminent writers 
                         - for no apparent reason. In fact, there 
                         are many instances not recorded in these 
                         articles in which Mr. Deeds satisfied 
                         an unnatural desire to smash people 
                         up without provocation.

                         his mental quirks, and constantly fearful 
                         of assault, turned down an opportunity 
                         to represent him as his attorney. This 
                         newspaper woman, whom we have subpoenaed 
                         to testify, tells how he tied up traffic 
                         for an hour feeding doughnuts to a poor 
                         horse. And by his own statement, waiting 
                         for that horse to ask for a cup of coffee.

                         There is laughter in the courtroom -

                         this little episode, and other photographs 
                         showing Mr. Deeds jumping upon a fire 
                         engine. This scarcely sounds like the 
                         action of a man in whom the disposition 
                         of twenty million dollars may safely 
                         be entrusted. This writer of these articles 
                         - a woman whose intelligence and integrity 
                         in the newspaper world is unquestioned 
                         - held him in such contempt that she 
                         quite aptly named him "The Cinderella 
                         Man."

                         We have witnesses here from Mandrake 
                         Falls, his own home town, who will tell 
                         of his conduct throughout his lifetime, 
                         proving that his derangement is neither 
                         recent nor a temporary one.
                                      
                         Longfellow's interest is only slightly 
                         aroused. He lifts his eyes in a casual 
                         glance around him.

                         We have others who will tell of his 
                         unusual behavior when he invited the 
                         great leaders of the musical world to 
                         his home, and then proceeded to forcibly 
                         eject them. Only recently when he was 
                         in the County Hospital for observation, 
                         he not only refused to be examined by 
                         these gentlemen, the state psychiatrists, 
                         but he actually made a violent attack 
                         upon them.

                         with an undercurrent of social unrest, 
                         the promulgation of such a weird, fantastic 
                         and impractical plan as contemplated 
                         by the defendant, is capable of fomenting 
                         a disturbance from which the country 
                         may not soon recover. It is our duty 
                         to stop it! Our government is fully 
                         aware of its difficulties and can pull 
                         itself out of its economic rut without

                         There is a mild stir, and all wait expectantly 
                         for Babe to appear.

                         Babe, eyes on Longfellow, slowly walks 
                         to the stand.

                         There is no answer. Babe continues to 
                         stare off at Longfellow, hoping he will 
                         look up. Cedar speaks to her again:

                         But Babe's attention remains focused 
                         on Longfellow.

                         done in an orderly fashion. When you 
                         have learned to show some respect for

                         an affectionate arm around her shoulders.

                         Two old ladies are being led to the 
                         witness stand. Their eyelids flutter 
                         excitedly as they go.

                         The Falkner sisters are rather timid, 
                         Your Honor, and wish to be together. 
                         If the court pleases, I will only have 
                         one of them testify.

                         Cedar turns to them.

                         I'll direct my questions to you, Miss 
                         Jane. You can answer for both. Do you 
                         know the defendant, Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
 
                                                              
                         The two old ladies look at each other, 
                         then in the direction in which Cedar 
                         points.

                         How long have you known him?
                                     
                         Jane turns to her sister, and they whisper 
                         to each other.

                         Since he was born.

                         Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.

                         Thank you, that's fine. Do you see him 
                         very often?

                         conference again.

                         Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. 
                         Now, will you tell the Court what everybody 
                         at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
 
                                                              
                         The two old ladies consult each other 
                         once more.

                         They think he's pixilated.

                         Now, that's a rather strange word to 
                         use, Miss Jane. Can you tell the court 
                         exactly what it means?
                                      
                         While the two ladies go into a huddle:

                         Perhaps I can explain, Your Honor. The 
                         word pixilated is an early American 
                         expression - derived from the word 'pixies,' 
                         meaning elves. They would say, 'The 
                         pixies had got him,' as we nowadays 
                         would say a man is 'balmy.'

                         Falkner sisters nod in pleasant agreement. 
                         Cedar sighs victoriously.

                         Now tell me, why does everyone think 
                         he's - uh - pixilated? Does he do peculiar

                         Now Dr. Von Holler, will you kindly 
                         tell the court what your opinion is 
                         on this case?
                                      
                         VON HOLLER
                                     
                         This is purely a case of manic depression. 
                         In cases of this kind, patients sometimes 
                         go on for years before being detected.
 
                                                              
                         He turns to one of the psychiatrists, 
                         sitting with the Judge.
                                      
                         VON HOLLER
                                     
                         You remember, Dr. Fosdick, in my last 
                         book there are some very fine examples.
 
                                                              
                         DR. FOSDICK
                                     
                         (nodding)
                                     
                         Uh-huh.
                                     
                         VON HOLLER
                                     
                         Especially, the one of the young nobleman, 
                         you remember?
                                      
                         DR. FOSDICK
                                     
                         Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. 
                         Very interesting.
                                      
                         VON HOLLER
                                     
                         It reminds me very much of this one. 
                         Nicht wahr?
                                      
                         DR. FOSDICK
                                     
                         Ja.
                                     
                         VON HOLLER
                                     
                         It takes so long to detect them—
                                     
                         (to Judge)
                                     
                         —because their mood changes so often 
                         and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may 
                         I show you? May I use the chart?

                         JUDGE
                                     
                         By all means.
                                     
                         He moves to a blackboard. There are 
                         chalk marks on it. A straight line runs 
                         diagonally across the center. Other 
                         lines run zig-zag over and below this 
                         center line.
                                      
                         VON HOLLER
                                     
                         (indicating chart)
                                     
                         Below here, they are extremely depressed, 
                         melancholy, impossible to live with, 
                         and often become violent.
                                      
                         (running a line up)
                                     
                         From this mood the manic depressive 
                         might gradually change until they reach 
                         this state.
                                      
                         (he reaches the center line)
                                     
                         Here is lucidity. Here they are perfectly 
                         normal. As normal as you or I—
                                      
                         (smiling)
                                     
                         —assuming, of course, that we are normal.
 
                                                              
                         (he starts up with chalk)
                                     
                         Then, the mood changes again until—
 
                                                              
                         (chalk reaches top)
                                     
                         —they reach this state, a state of highest 
                         exaltation. Here everything is fine. 
                         Here the world is beautiful. Here they 
                         are so elated - how do you express it?
 
                                                              
                         (quickly, as it comes to him)
                                     
                         —they would give you the shirt off their 
                         backs!

                         Dr. Von Holler, how would you say that 
                         applied to Mr. Deeds's case?
                                      
                         VON HOLLER
                                     
                         The symptoms are obvious.
                                     
                         (points to top line)
                                     
                         When he was here, on top of the wave, 
                         he felt nothing but kindliness and warmth 
                         toward his fellow-men. He wanted them 
                         around him. So he decided he would give 
                         a big reception. But in the meantime, 
                         his mood has changed.
                                      
                         (chalk goes down)
                                     
                         He is now at the bottom of the wave 
                         - depressed - melancholy. So, when his 
                         guests arrive, he throws them out. They 
                         are now his imaginary enemies.

                         As Von Holler's voice continues:
                                     
                         VON HOLLER'S VOICE
                                     
                         Other instances of high elation are 
                         when he plays his tuba, when he writes 
                         his poetry, when he chases fire engines 
                         in his desire to help humanity. This 
                         is contrasted with his present mood, 
                         which is so low that even the instinct 
                         for self-preservation is lacking.

                         Von Holler still continues:

                         Oh, the man is verrukt. Your Honor, 
                         this is decidedly a case of a manic 
                         depressive.

                         Dr. Von Holler returns to his seat.

                         There is a shifting of bodies, and a 
                         renewed interest, as they wait for the 
                         next move. The Judge and his own two

                         The Judge watches him a few moments,

                         experts.

                         testimony and your continued silence 
                         and upon recommendation of the doctors, 
                         the Court considers it advisable for 
                         your own safety that you be committed 
                         to an institution as prescribed by law. 
                         You need medical attention, Mr. Deeds.

                         Suddenly the air is rent with the shrill 
                         voice of Babe.

                         All are startled and look up. Babe runs 
                         right to the Judge.

                         principally by me. He's been the victim 
                         of every conniving crook in town. The 
                         newspapers pounced on him - made him

                         Your Honor, her testimony is of no value. 
                         Why shouldn't she defend him? It's a 
                         tribute to American womanhood - the 
                         instinct to protect the weak. I'm not 
                         saying that nobody likes the boy. I 
                         cherish a fond affection for him myself.

                         Miss Bennett said. I'm her editor. When 
                         she quit her job, she told me what a 
                         swell fellow this man was. And anything 
                         Babe Bennett says is okay with me.

                         a lot of fuss has been made about that. 
                         If a man's crazy just 'cause he plays 
                         the tuba, then somebody better look 
                         into it, 'cause there are a lot of tuba

                         I don't see any harm in it. I play mine

                         As he looks up from the document. He 
                         is a trifle self-conscious. Laughter 
                         comes from the courtroom.

                         That may make you look a little crazy, 
                         Your Honor, just sitting around filling 
                         in O's - but I don't see anything wrong 
                         'cause that helps you to think. Other 
                         people are doodlers.

                         That's a name we made up back home for 
                         people who make foolish designs on paper 
                         when they're thinking. It's called doodling. 
                         Almost everybody's a doodler. Did you 
                         ever see a scratch pad in a telephone 
                         booth? People draw the most idiotic 
                         pictures when they're thinking. Dr. 
                         Von Holler, here, could probably think 
                         up a long name for it, because he doodles 
                         all the time.
                                      
                         Dr. Von Holler, who is in the middle 
                         of some doodling, flinches. A roar of 
                         laughter comes from the spectators. 
                         Longfellow reaches over to where Dr. 
                         Von Holler sits and picks up a piece 
                         of paper.

                         (to Dr. Von Holler)
                                     
                         Thank you.

                         This is a piece of paper he was scribbling 
                         on.

                         I can't figure it out. One minute it 
                         looks like a chimpanzee - and the next 
                         minute it looks like a picture of Mr. 
                         Cedar.

                         You look at it, Judge.
                                     
                         The Judge, with a serious mien, takes 
                         the paper.

                         It is a doodle face.

                         Dr. Von Holler is somewhat uncomfortable.

                         Looks kind of stupid, doesn't it, Your 
                         Honor? But I guess that's all right 
                         if Dr. Von Holler has to doodle to help 
                         him think. That's his business. Everybody 
                         does something different. Some people 
                         are—

                         He looks up, startled, his nose twitching 
                         more violently than ever. The courtroom 
                         rocks with laughter.
                                      
                         His wife, in her nervousness, pulls 
                         at her fingers.

                         Mrs. Semple quickly drops her hands

                         with laughter.

                         He swings a key-ring around his forefinger. 
                         Suddenly he realizes Longfellow might 
                         get to him, and he hastily palms the 
                         keys and shoves them in his pocket.

                         - biting the end of his pencil. The 
                         one next to him nudges him and silently 
                         points to the pencil in his mouth. The 
                         reporter gets the idea and, smiling 
                         sheepishly, yanks it out of his mouth.

                         Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting 
                         people from your home?

                         Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those 
                         people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi 
                         told the truth. I did throw them out 
                         because I didn't want the party in the 
                         first place. I didn't invite anybody. 
                         Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just 
                         came to see what kind of a freak the 
                         "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how 
                         people like that are supposed to act, 
                         Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman 
                         is an example, I'll stick to simple 
                         folks. She just came in, talked my ear 
                         off, and took charge of everything. 
                         If I were a friend of hers, I'd have 
                         her examined.

                         Your Honor, this is becoming farcical. 
                         I demand that Mr. Deeds dispense with 
                         side remarks and confine himself to 
                         facts! Let him explain his wanderings 
                         around the streets in underclothes, 
                         his feeding doughnuts to horses!

                         Mr. Cedar's right. Those things do look 
                         kind of bad, don't they? But to tell 
                         the truth, Your Honor, I don't remember 
                         them. I guess they happened, all right, 
                         because I don't think a policeman would 
                         lie about a thing like that, but I was 
                         drunk. It was the first time I was ever 
                         drunk in my life. It's probably happened 
                         to you, some time. I mean, when you 
                         were younger, of course.
                                      
                         The Judge clears his throat in embarrassment. 
                         Several women giggle. The Judge sternly 
                         pounds his gavel.

                         It's likely to happen to anybody. Just 
                         the other morning I read in the paper 
                         about Mr. Cedar's own son - about how 
                         he got drunk and insisted on driving 
                         a taxi-cab, while the driver sat inside. 
                         Isn't that so, Mr. Cedar? Isn't that 
                         so , Mr. Cedar?
                                      
                         344. MED. SHOT OF COURTROOM
                                     
                         All eyes have turned to Cedar.
                                     
                         345. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR

                         Now about the Falkner sisters. That's 
                         kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar 
                         going all the way to Mandrake Falls 
                         to bring them here. Do you mind if I 
                         talk to them?
                                      
                         JUDGE
                                     
                         Not at all.
                                     
                         Longfellow turns. Everybody stretches 
                         to get a better look at them.

                         Why, you own it, Longfellow.
                                     
                         AMY
                                     
                         Yes, you own it.

                         JANE
                                     
                         (after conferring with Amy)
                                     
                         No, we don't pay any rent.

                         As Longfellow continues questioning:

                         Oh, yes.
                                     
                         AMY

                         Now, Jane, a little while ago you said 
                         I was pixilated. Do you still think 
                         so?
                                      
                         JANE
                                     
                         (after the usual conference)
                                     
                         Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
 
                                                              
                         AMY
                                     
                         Always.
                                     
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         (smiling)
                                     
                         That's fine. I guess maybe I am.
                                     
                         (seriously)
                                     
                         Now tell me something, Jane. Who else 
                         in Mandrake Falls is pixilated?
                                      
                         Jane turns to her sister and this time 
                         they go into a prolonged huddle. It 
                         is apparently a difficult thing to figure 
                         out. Finally they come out of it.
 
                                                              
                         JANE
                                     
                         Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in 
                         pixilated - except us.

                         There is an outburst of laughter which 
                         the Judge quickly quells with his gavel.

                         Now, just one more question. Do you 
                         see the Judge here? He's a nice man, 
                         isn't he?

                         Do you think he's pixilated?
                                     
                         JANE
                                     
                         (quickly)
                                     
                         Oh, yes.

                         There is more laughter. More pounding 
                         of the judiciary gavel.

                         Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon 
                         a most important thing. This rather 
                         fantastic idea of yours to want to give 
                         away your entire fortune. It is, to 
                         say the least, most uncommon.

                         Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your 
                         Honor.
                                      
                         CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSER SHOT, featuring 
                         Longfellow and Judge, as former continues:

                         Suppose you were living in a small town 
                         and getting along fine, and suddenly 
                         somebody dropped $20,000,000 in your 
                         lap. Supposing you discovered that all 
                         that money was messing up your life, 
                         was bringing a lot of vultures around 
                         your neck, and making you lose faith 
                         in everybody. You'd be a little worried, 
                         wouldn't you? You'd feel that you had 
                         a hot potato in your hand, and you'd 
                         want to drop it. I guess Dr. Von Holler 
                         would say you were riding on—

                         —those bottom waves, 'cause you wanted 
                         to drop something that was burning your 
                         fingers.

                         Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's 
                         raving about. From what I can see, no 
                         matter what system of government we 
                         have, there will always be leaders and 
                         always be followers.

                         Farmers in audience, as Longfellow's 
                         voice continues:

                         It's like the road out in front of my 
                         house. It's on a steep hill. Every day 
                         I watch the cars climbing up. Some go 
                         lickety-split up that hill on high—

                         —some have to shift into second - and 
                         some sputter and shake and slip back 
                         to the bottom again. Same cars - same 
                         gasoline - yet some make it and some 
                         don't. And I say the fellows who can 
                         make the hill on high should stop once 
                         in a while and help those who can't.

                         That's all I'm trying to do with this 
                         money. Help the fellows who can't make 
                         the hill on high.

                         with it? Give it to him - and a lot 
                         of other people who don't need it?

                         like I'm out in a big boat and I see 
                         one fellow in a rowboat who's tired 
                         of rowing and wants a free ride - and 
                         another fellow who's drowning. Who would 
                         you expect me to rescue? Mr. Cedar, 
                         who just got tired of rowing and wants 
                         a free ride? Or those men out there 
                         who are drowning? Any ten-year-old child 
                         will give you the answer to that.
 
                                                              
                         (to farmers etc. in courtroom)
                                     
                         All right, fellows. Thank you. Sit down.
 
                                                              
                         362. MEDIUM SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM

                         Now, my plan is very simple. I was going 
                         to give each family ten acres - a horse, 
                         a cow and some seed. And if they work 
                         the farm for three years, it's theirs. 
                         Now, if that's crazy, maybe I ought 
                         to be sent to an institution. But I 
                         don't think it is. And what's more, 
                         Mr. Cedar doesn't either.
                                      
                         (vehemently)
                                     
                         Just before the hearing started, he 
                         offered to call the whole thing off 
                         if I made a settlement with him. So 
                         you see, he wouldn't think I was crazy 
                         if he got paid off.

                         He jumps to his feet, highly incensed.

                         Anything else, Mr. Deeds?

                         (eyes still on Cedar)
                                     
                         No.
                                     
                         (changes his mind; turns to Judge)
 
                                                              
                         Yes. There's just one more thing I'd 
                         like to get off my chest before I finish.
 
                                                              
                         JUDGE
                                     
                         Proceed.

                         He rises to his feet, takes one step 
                         forward, and clouts Cedar flush on the 
                         jaw. As Cedar falls into the arms of 
                         an associate, pandemonium breaks loose.

                         The Judge pounds his gavel. There are 
                         cries of approval from the spectators. 
                         In the midst of the commotion—

                         The Judge comes out of the huddle; his 
                         face is very stern.

                         the police have orders to arrest anyone 
                         creating a disturbance.

                         His mouth curls up in a contented grimace.

                         All eyes are upon the Judge, who clears 
                         his throat.
                                      
                         JUDGE
                                     
                         (serious mien)
                                     
                         Mr. Deeds, there has been a great deal 
                         of damaging testimony against you. Your 
                         behavior, to say the least, has been 
                         most strange.
                                      
                         An audible gasp is heard from audience. 
                         Judge goes on:
                                      
                         JUDGE
                                     
                         But in the opinion of the Court, you 
                         are not only sane, but you are the sanest 
                         man that ever walked into this courtroom. 
                         Case dismissed!
                                      
                         The shout that greets this is tumultuous. 
                         The Judge smiles warmly, and clasps 
                         Longfellow's hand. Immediately, Longfellow 
                         is surrounded by a crowd of people who 
                         come running down the aisles.

                         They sit, stunned, disappointed. Mrs. 
                         Semple turns to her husband and slaps 
                         him.
                                      
                         MRS. SEMPLE
                                     
                         You nose-twitcher!
                                     
                         Budington rises to confront Cedar.

                         Oh, I knew it! I knew it! You, you—
 
                                                              
                         Cedar disgustedly pushes him in the 
                         face, aside.

                         She smiles ecstatically, too excited 
                         to move. Suddenly she rises.
                                      
                         379. MEDIUM SHOT
                                     
                         As Babe tries to get to Longfellow, 
                         but finds herself on the fringe of a 
                         jubilant crowd in the center of which 
                         is Longfellow. She tries to break through, 
                         but finds it impossible. Desperately, 
                         she jumps on a chair and tries frantically 
                         to get a glimpse of him. At that moment, 
                         several farmers have lifted Longfellow 
                         on their shoulders.

                         As jubilantly, Longfellow is carried 
                         out on the shoulders of the excited 
                         crowd.

                         As Babe frantically tries to reach Longfellow, 
                         but is jostled aside. The parade envelops 
                         her.

                         The shouting mob is heading for the 
                         door at end of courtroom. Everyone crowds 
                         forward.

                         Babe is left helplessly out.

                         still whispering to each other, and 
                         Babe, sitting helpless and forlorn.

                         Her eyes are filled. Dismally she starts 
                         forward. We hear a rising commotion 
                         from the outside, at this moment.

                         the mob, shouting, back of him. He reaches 
                         courtroom, slams the doors shut behind 
                         him. Babe, attracted by the noise, looks 
                         up. He runs toward her, and swoops her 
                         up in his arms.

                         388. CLOSE SHOT - BABE AND LONGFELLOW
 
                                                              
                         She kisses him over and over again. 
                         He looks around and over his shoulder 
                         at the mob, a little dazed. Finally, 
                         he notices her effort, and gives her 
                         one passionately back.
                                      
                         All that is heard is the cheering of 
                         the crowd outside and the Columbia music.
 
                                                              
                         FADE OUT.
                                     
                         THE END
