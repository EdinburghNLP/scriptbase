     TITLE CARDS:   THIS FILM IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY (BEAT)

                                 (SORT OF)

     INT. DMV -- AFTERNOON

     The DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES.
     People are jam-packed into the internal maze of cubicles. It
     doesn't get more crowded and disgusting than this. THE SOUND
     OF SCREAMING BABIES IS INTERRUPTED BY A-

     BING.

                          ROBOTIC FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                Now serving F134. Please report
                to window eight.

     This is the sound that the DMV AUTOMATED SYSTEM makes every
     fifteen seconds. A BING for each human being who waits to be
     processed through the system.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                When I was a little girl... my
                mum took me to Euro Disney on
                opening day. I was told that it
                was the happiest place on earth.

     BOY looks down at the little piece of PAPER in his hand with
     the number B144 printed on it... wakes up DAD. They move
     toward window twelve.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                A week later... we moved to Los
                Angeles. I was told that this was
                the saddest place on Earth. The
                Department of Motor Vehicles in
                Los Angeles.

     The CAMERA PANS across more POOR PEOPLE. They look down at
     their numbers.  Mostly Hispanic, African-American.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                They wait for their number to be
                called. They wait for this
                license to drive to yet another
                miserable job... dive pub...
                drive by shooting.
                     (beat)
                That is if they're lucky enough
                to own an automobile. Most of
                them aren't. They need a license
                to prove their citizenship or
                else they'll be deported.

     The CAMERA ARRIVES at the last chair on the row. There is a
     FRATERNITY GUY named FRANCES (20) sitting in it.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Except for this bloke. His name
                is Frances. Mr. 90210 college boy
                had found himself in the wrong
                place at the wrong time.

     Frances has a MOTOROLA to his ear. He seems very anxious.

                          FRANCES
                     (whispering into the phone)
                I said... they're about to call
                my number. Are you in... or are
                you out?

     Frances taps his shoe nervously on the linoleum floor.

                          FRANCES (CONT'D)
                A thousand all in for one
                license. That's the deal.

     Frances grits his teeth.

                          FRANCES (CONT'D)
                You have to decide right now.
                They're gonna call my number any
                second.

     Frances takes a deep breath. A sigh of relief.

                          FRANCES (CONT'D)
                Alright. We're on.

     He hangs up the phone, then glances up at the MONITOR...
     waiting for his number. The CAMERA MOVES slowly into his
     face.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                There are three kinds of people
                in this world. The rich... the
                poor... and everyone in between.

     A bead of SWEAT rolls down Frances' temple. He glances over at a
     BLACK TEENAGER filling out a form. Brief eye contact. Frances
     looks away.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                The poor people hate the rich
                because... well... they're
                fucking rich.

     BING.

                          ROBOTIC FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                Now serving G086. Please report
                to window six.

     Frances glances down at his number. G086. He takes a deep
     breath and walks over to WINDOW SIX.

     Sitting behind the counter is LATEESHA RODRIGUEZ (28). She is
     filing her FINGERNAILS. They are VERY LONG... VERY SHARP...
     and VERY COLORFUL.

                          FRANCES
                Kee Kee.

     Lateesha raises her eyes to meet Frances. He drops an
     ENVELOPE on the desk in front of her. Lateesha's demeanor
     changes. She slowly opens the envelope and removes a piece of
     PAPER from inside.

                          FRANCES (CONT'D)
                Four.

     Lateesha returns her gaze to Frances. She then folds the
     paper, places it back into the envelope and drops it into a
     drawer.

                          LATEESHA
                Four to six weeks.

     Frances glares back at her.

                          FRANCES
                You said you could deliver the
                ID's tonight.

     Lateesha has gone back to filing her turbo nails.

                          LATEESHA
                Four to six weeks... Frances.

     Frances' blood has begun to boil.

                          FRANCES
                    (fierce whisper)
                Listen, bitch. I'm paying you
                double this time. Kee Kee said
                tonight. I paid half in advance
                like she said.

     Rage is building in Lateesha's eyes. No one talks to her this
     way and gets away with it.

     In the next CUBICLE... RAOUL SANCHEZ (30), an OBESE HISPANIC
     MAN with BLONDS HIGHLIGHTS, leans his head over.

                          RAOUL
                Lateesha... I need that web link.

     Lateesha does not answer. Her eyes are locked on Frances.

                          LATEESHA
                Kee Kee don't make the rules. I
                said... four to six weeks.

                          FRANCES
                I don't know if you realize who
                the fuck you're dealing with
                here. I can have your job
                eliminated like that.
                    (beat)
                Say good-bye to your little side
                business...

     Frances cranes his neck to see the NAME PLATE on her desk.

                          FRANCES (CONT'D)
                ...Lateesha. If that is your real
                name.
                    (beat)
                If you don't have those ID's
                ready tonight by 8PM like Kee Kee
                promised... you can say hello to
                the fucking welfare line... cause
                your life as government employee
                is over.

     Raoul is persistent.

                          RAOUL
                Teesha... I need that web link!
                The J-Lo concert is probably sold
                out already!

     Lateesha raises one GIGANTIC FINGERNAIL in Raoul's direction
     as if to say... IN A MINUTE. Raoul sighs impatiently and
     ducks back into his cubicle... cursing her in Spanish.

                          FRANCES
                What's it gonna be, Lateesha? Get
                ready to start counting those
                food stamps.

     Lateesha opens the DRAWER and removes the envelope. Gears are
     turning. Decisions are being made.

                          LATEESHA
                Tonight. 8PM.

     She taps her nails on the plastic surface of the table.

                          LATEESHA (CONT'D)
                Anything else?

     Frances shakes his head slowly.

                          FRANCES
                Nope.

                          LATEESHA
                Good-bye... Frances.

     As Frances turns to leave, Lateesha slams a PLASTIC SIGN down
     onto the ledge of WINDOW SIX. It reads: THIS WINDOW CLOSED.
     Lateesha then unfolds the piece of PAPER inside the envelope.

     The following SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS are printed in BLACK INK:

          774-32-5543 : 342-77-0098 : 323-34-5452 : 854-80-6745

     Lateesha stares at the numbers... gears turning.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Love is a desperate measure.

     Lateesha takes the LOCKET that hangs around her neck and
     opens it. Inside... there are two photographs. A TEENAGE GIRL
     and a LITTLE BABY.

                          LATEESHA
                Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em all.

     Lateesha takes a deep breath... kisses the locket and closes it.
     She drops the paper down on the table and begins to type the
     SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS into her COMPUTER.

     Raoul leans over once again.

                          RAOUL
                Lateesha... I needed that web
                link an hour ago!

     Lateesha continues typing... disregarding his annoying plea.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Desperate measures often have
                disastrous consequences...

     Raoul stands up. He is losing his temper.

                          RAOUL
                Lateesha... girl... are you
                listening?

     Nope. Fingernails keep typing. FOUR DRIVER'S LICENSES pop up on
     her computer screen. We get a glance at FOUR DMV PHOTOS. FOUR
     MEN. FRANCES is one of them.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                The story of my life.

     Raoul's voice has become an unbearable high-pitched shrill.

                          RAOUL
                LATEESHA... THE WEB LINK. I NEED
                IT RIGHT NOW! THE CONCERT IS
                GONNA SELL OUT! WE'RE NOT GONNA
                MAKE IT!

     Lateesha whips her head around with the SASSY OUTRAGE
     cultivated by so many years at this shitty job.

                          LATEESHA
                    (screaming out)WWW.SHUT-THE-FUCK-UP.COM





     The entire DMV is silenced.  Raoul lowers back into his chair.

     Lateesha turns back to her computer screen. She aligns the
     MOUSE POINTER on the word SEND. She then lowers her GIGANTIC
     FINGERNAIL onto the MOUSE with the sound of DISTANT THUNDER.

     BEGIN CREDIT SEQUENCE: U2 & JOHNNY CASH - THE WANDERER

     The STREETS are filled with MILLIONS upon MILLIONS of
     DOMINOES. They are assembled in many colorful patterns seen
     in such 80's television programs as "THAT'S INCREDIBLE!" and
     "RIPLEY'S... BELIEVE IT OR NOT!".

     At the intersection of Wilshire and Santa Monica, THOUSANDS
     of falling dominoes assembled to spell out:

                         NEW LINE CINEMA PRESENTS


     In Beverly Hills... there are thousands of falling dominoes
     assembled to spell out:

                   A DAVIS FILMS/SCOTT FREE PRODUCTION

     On the abandoned 10 FREEWAY the dominoes read:

                            A TONY SCOTT FILM

     On the abandoned 405 FREEWAY the dominoes read:

                          D   O   M   I   N   O


     We follow the IMMENSE TRAIL of falling dominoes throughout
     the city... through DOWNTOWN... CENTURY CITY... SANTA
     MONICA... COMPTON... revealing the rest of the OPENING
     CREDITS.

     As we near the end of the sequence the trail takes us out
     into the DESERT where the falling dominoes read:

                         WRITTEN BY RICHARD KELLY

     The dominoes approach the lights of LAS VEGAS... approaching the
     western end of the STRIP. It is completely desolate. The lights
     twinkle... but there is no one there.

     The dominoes finish on a PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC BRIDGE that
     crosses the strip. They read:

                          DIRECTED BY TONY SCOTT


     The TRAIL of dominoes tapers off into a CEMENT HALLWAY...
     leading into the shadows. A METAL DOOR looms in the distance.

     The CAMERA lingers on the FINAL DOMINO... moving through the
     METAL DOOR.

     INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT

     DOMINO HARVEY (25) sits alone at a METAL TABLE. Despite her
     disheveled appearance, she looks like she could be on the cover
     of VOGUE.

     Her hands are cuffed together. She holds a MARLBORO RED between
     the fingers on her right hand... raising it to her mouth. There
     is BLOOD SPLATTERED on her hand. A small cut on her lip.

     A SINGLE TEAR traces down her cheek. There is a CHILD LINGERING
     just beneath the tough surface veneer.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                My name is Domino Harvey.
                    (beat)
                I am... a bounty hunter.

     Domino flips a book of MATCHES between her fingers. She raises
     her eyes to the GLASS WALL on the south end of the room.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                They're watching me from behind
                that two way mirror. What I say
                over the next several hours will
                determine whether or not I spend
                the rest of my life in prison.

     Domino takes a pull from her Marlboro, wiping the tear away from
     her face. The METAL DOOR opens... and an attractive woman in a
     black business suit steps into the room. Her name is TARYN MILES
     (38).

                          TARYN
                Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn
                Miles. I'm a criminal
                psychologist working for the FBI.
                I'm here to ask you a few
                questions.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Here's the part where I'm
                supposed to get all defensive and
                say... 'not until I speak with my
                attorney.'

     Domino takes another pull from her Marlboro... then stubs it in
     the ash tray.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                Sure... I'll tell you everything
                I know.

     Taryn removes a file from her attache case and places it on the
     table.

                          TARYN
                Thirty-six hours ago... ten
                million dollars was stolen from
                an armored car that was
                subsequently found abandoned at
                the Hoover Dam.

     EXT. DESERT -- DAWN -- THIRTY-SIX HOURS BEFORE


     The CAMERA SOARS over the desert... approaching the lights at
     the Hoover Dam. An ARMORED CAR is parked on the edge of the
     cement abyss.

                          TARYN (V.O.)
                The driver's name was Locus
                Fender. We know that he was in on
                the heist.

     INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT

     LOCUS FENDER (30s) is behind the wheel of the armored car. His
     unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in
     his security uniform.

     INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT

     Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad.

                          TARYN
                Where is the money?

                          DOMINO
                I don't know.

                          TARYN
                I think that you're lying. I
                think you know exactly where the
                money is.

                          DOMINO
                You're trying to scare me into
                falsely incriminating myself...
                and it's not working. I said I'd
                tell you everything I know. You
                and your friends behind the
                mirror.

     Domino waves to the mirror. Taryn calmly opens her file...
     refusing to lose control.

                          TARYN
                Is it true that you were hired to
                track down and capture the
                thieves... and then deliver them
                to Drake Bishop... owner of the
                Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?

                          DOMINO
                Yes.

                          TARYN
                You then learned where the
                thieves had hidden the money...
                and at the instructions of your
                employer went to retrieve it
                yourself.

                          DOMINO
                He sent us out to the Fender
                Compound. Out in the desert near
                the Chicken Ranch.


     INT. FENDER HOUSE -- THE PREVIOUS NIGHT

     The FRONT DOOR to this house is KICKED FORWARD... snapping
     off its hinges onto the cheap tile floor.

     A HISPANIC MAN named CHOCO (38) is standing there with a
     SHOTGUN. He steps forward into the DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER HOME
     attached to an ADOBE SHACK.

     Behind him is a CAUCASIAN MAN named ED MARTIN (50s) wielding
     his own shotgun.

     As the two men part ways... DOMINO... wearing jeans and a T-
     shirt... follows them through the doorway into the house. She
     carries a SEMI-AUTOMATIC PISTOL... moving into the FAMILY ROOM
     ahead of the men.

     The tiny family room is pure SOUTH-WESTERN DESERT TRAILER PARK
     kitsch. None of the furniture matches. Shag carpeting. Georgia
     O'Keefe knockoffs on the walls. Stained wagon-wheel coffee
     tables.

     Domino notices the LA-Z-BOY in the corner of the room. It is
     gently rocking back and forth.

     A low growling noise can be heard from the kitchen.

                          DOMINO
                EDNA! WE KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE!

     Domino turns back to the men with a raised finger... issuing
     a silent warning.

     In the KITCHEN... EDNA FENDER (60s) is sitting on the floor
     against the cabinets. There is a SHOTGUN in her left hand. A
     PIT-BULL is restrained by its COLLAR in her right.

     She looks down at the dog, CHI-CHI (3), with a clenched jaw.

                          EDNA
                Sick boy... Sick-em!

     SHE LETS GOT OF THE COLLAR AND CHI-CHI SPRINTS AROUND THE
     CORNER...

     BLAM!

     Choco fires a SHOTGUN BLAST into the floor of the trailer...
     detonating a HOLE in the carpet that is two feet wide.

     CHI-CHI falls YELPING into the hole... cartwheeling down into
     the DARK ABYSS beneath the trailer.

     Domino turns back to Choco and sees that he still has his
     SHOTGUN aimed at the floor. Smoke drifts from the barrels
     into the gloom of the house.

                          CHOCO (SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                FUCK... I MISSED!

     Domino throws him a nod of gratitude anyway. He returns.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                That's my best friend. His name
                is Choco. He's always fancied
                me... but too shy to ever do
                anything about it.

                          EDNA
                Chi-Chi!
                    (desperate beat)
                CHI-CHI!

                          DOMINO
                Chi-Chi has gone to doggie
                heaven, bitch!

     Choco cocks his shotgun for emphasis. SHELLS drop down into
     the abyss. He likes it when Domino talks rough.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                The next one is going to doggie
                hell!

     Ed snaps his fingers... and Choco removes his BACKPACK and
     begins to retrieve something from it.

                          ED
                All we want is the money, Edna!

     Domino looks back at him... waiting for a signal.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                That's Ed Martin. The most
                legendary bounty hunter in all of
                Los Angeles. He's my boss. My
                mentor. The father I never had.

     Edna is now SOBBING loudly.

                          EDNA
                Chi-Chi... my poor Chi-Chi.

     Ed throws Domino a nod. She moves further into the family
     room.

     Edna may have shitty taste... but she isn't poor. Domino
     notices the MITSUBISHI widescreen. Surround Sound. DVD
     Player. The Manchurian Candidate is playing.

                          DOMINO
                The Manchurian Candidate, huh
                Edna?

     In the KITCHEN... Edna leans over and grabs a BUDWEISER
     longneck from a STYRO-FOAM COOLER. With the shotgun still in
     her left hand, she cracks the bottle open with her right and
     takes a long swig.

                          EDNA
                Is that you, Domino?

                          DOMINO
                Nice to see you again, Edna.

     Edna lets out a sly cackle... wiping the bitter tears from
     her face. She is wicked tough... not to mention wicked drunk.
     Age has not been kind to this desert harlot.

                          EDNA
                Your father must be so proud.
                    (beat)
                Look what has become of his
                little angel.

     Ouch. That hit Domino below the belt.

                          DOMINO
                Listen bitch! We've got your son!
                If you don't deliver the money...
                we're gonna wax his fucking ass!

     Edna takes another swig of Budweiser. The RAGE returns.

                          EDNA
                YOU DON'T HAVE SHIT!

     Domino turns back to Choco. He has unwrapped a LARGE OBJECT
     from the backpack. It remains hidden in the shadows. Domino
     stares at it with trepidation. She's in over her head.

     Choco steps forward into the light and we see that the object
     is a SEVERED HUMAN ARM. The BLOODY STUMP ends at the UPPER
     BICEP.

     Choco lobs the arm over the KITCHEN COUNTER and it lands on
     the linoleum floor next to Edna with a loud thump.

                          ED
                Don't fuck with us, Edna! There
                are at least three more limbs
                where that one came from!

                          DOMINO
                I can certainly think of one
                more!

     Edna stares at the severed arm with her mouth twisted into a
     grimace of horror.

     Edna closes her eyes... takes a swig of Budweiser and then
     LEAPS up onto her FEET. She COCKS the shotgun and aims it
     blindly over the counter into the FAMILY ROOM.

                          EDNA
                AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!

     SHE UNLOADS TWO ROUNDS. TWO SHOTGUN BLASTS RIP HOLES IN THE WALL
     BETWEEN ED AND CHOCO. EVERYONE HITS THE GROUND.

     Edna drops back down to the kitchen floor.

     Domino's face is buried into the shag carpet. Her heart is
     pounding.

                          DOMINO
                HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!

                          EDNA
                PROVE IT!

     Domino looks back at Ed... sweat pouring down his face. He
     then motions to Choco... who moves out the front door.

     EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- NIGHT

     Choco comes through the front door of the FENDER HOUSE... a
     one-story RANCHER built from several double-wide trailers.

     The FENDER COMPOUND sits out in the desert near JOSHUA TREE.
     There are JUNKED CARS, BARBED WIRE and SIGNS saying Keep out,
     Private Property, and Beware of Dog. Several FIRES are
     burning in metal barrels... sending smoke signals out across
     the horizon.

     Parked near the GATE of the compound is a large WINNEBAGO.
     Choco unlocks the door and steps inside.

     INT. WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Inside the winnebago are BRIAN AUSTIN GREEN (30s) and IAN
     ZIERING (40s), former stars of "BEVERLY HILLS, 90210". They are
     both handcuffed and splattered with blood. We will soon learn
     why.

     Next to them sits an AFGHANI MAN named ALF (40s). He is
     eating PIZZA at the kitchen table while watching "WHO WANTS
     TO BE A MILLIONAIRE" on a small television.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                We gotta show Edna her son.

     The Afghani nods his head... waiting for the show contestant
     to answer the question.

                          ALF (IN ARABIC WITH SUBTITLES)
                Eat dick. I'm watching
                Millionaire.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                Raghead.

                          ALF (IN ARABIC WITH SUBTITLES)
                Wetback.

     Alf wipes his mouth and turns to the back of the winnebago.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                That's our driver. He's from
                Afghanistan. He once ate a cat.
                    (beat)
                We can't understand how to
                pronounce his fucking name so we
                just call him Alf. The cat-eating
                alien.

     We see that he is wearing a T-shirt with a picture of ALF (THE
     ORANGE FUR COVERED SITCOM ALIEN) on it.

     Alf disappears behind a curtain. We hear someone moaning from
     back there. Alf mumbles something.

     Choco looks at his watch anxiously. He seems to be under a
     lot of pressure. His clothes are splattered with blood. The
     entire Winnebago is splattered with blood. Some nasty shit
     has transpired.

     Alf emerges from the back of the winnebago with Locus Fender.
     His LEFT ARM is missing. The wound has been sealed with DUCT
     TAPE. He is pale and delirious from the loss of blood.

     Choco helps Alf drag him out of the winnebago.


     EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- NEXT

     Alf and Choco walk Locus toward the front entrance to the
     house. His shoes drag through the sand. Choco coughs at the
     smoke from the burning barrels.

     INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT

     Taryn is scrawling notes on her legal pad.

                          TARYN
                How did Locus Fender lose his
                arm?

                          DOMINO
                He had the combination to the
                safe tattooed on his arm.

     INT. FENDER HOUSE -- NEXT

     Choco and Alf arrive in the doorway with LOCUS. He seems to
     be regaining consciousness.

                          LOCUS
                Momma! What'd you do with my
                momma!

                          EDNA
                LOCUS! BABY... I'M HERE!

                          DOMINO
                Turn over your weapon, Edna!

     After another swig of Bud, Edna rises from behind the kitchen
     counter. She throws the shotgun to Domino... who catches it
     with one hand.

                          ED
                    (to Locus)
                Give her the combination to the
                safe or you're gonna be twenty-
                five percent more paraplegic.

     Ed is all business as he places the barrels of his shotgun
     against the man's RIGHT SHOULDER. Locus nods his head slowly.
     He is terrified.

                          LOCUS
                Momma... I need you to say...
                exactly as I do.
                    (slurring)
                The combination code is on the
                wrist... just above the palm.
                You'll need to get the decoder
                from my bedroom.

     Edna turns to move down the hall.

                          DOMINO
                Not so fast!

     Domino moves toward Edna with her gun pointed in her face.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                I'm coming with you.

     INT. FENDER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NEXT

     Domino follows Edna down the hallway into the BEDROOM. Edna
     immediately begins to rifle through the middle dresser
     drawer. Domino notices a huge VELVET PAINTING of a young Edna
     as a SHOWGIRL hanging above the water bed.

     Edna retrieves a CIRCULAR CARDBOARD DECODER RING. It appears
     to be made out of several PAPER PLATES.

                          DOMINO
                Is that the decoder?

                          EDNA
                Yeah.

     INT. FENDER HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER


     Edna now sits in the La-Z-Boy. Ed drops the severed arm into
     her lap. There are NUMBERS and LETTERS TATTOOED ALL OVER IT.
     Ed glances over at a LARGE ANTIQUE SAFE in the corner of the
     trailer.

                          ED
                You have twenty minutes to open
                that safe.

     Edna begins to run her finger along her son's severed arm...
     reading off LETTERS and NUMBERS... turning the WHEEL of the
     DECODER RING.

     Domino drops down onto the couch. She looks exhausted. They
     have been through hell and it shows.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                I've never killed anyone. I hope
                to never kill anyone.
                Even if they deserve it. My
                agenda is to kick ass and secure
                the bounty.

     Ed passes Domino one of Edna's Budweisers and drops down on
     the couch next to her. She takes a long swig.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                If I'm on this side of the law...
                I can live the low life and avoid
                jail. I can live the nasty and
                not do time for it.
                    (beat)
                That's called the best of both
                worlds.

     The CAMERA moves in toward Domino's face.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                As for that other world... that
                90210 world... it's not for me.

     On the TELEVISION... actor LAURENCE HARVEY (40s) appears on
     the screen with FRANK SINATRA and JANET LEIGH.

                          ED
                Is that him?

     Domino nods her head slowly. Choco takes a seat on the other
     side of the couch, popping the cap off his own Budweiser.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                My real father was an actor. He
                died when I was a little girl.

                          ED
                Wow. Laurence Harvey. He knew
                Frank Sinatra?
                    (beat)
                I knew Frank.

     Edna SNORTS sarcastically from the La-Z-Boy.

                          EDNA
                Who didn't?

                          ED
                Shut the fuck up, Edna.
                    (looking at his watch)
                You have seventeen minutes to
                deliver that combination.

     Ed turns back to the screen.

                          ED (CONT'D)
                Is that the bitch from Murder,
                She Wrote?

     They watch the film unfold silently. The CAMERA MOVES in toward
     the Mitsubishi widescreen. The Manchurian Candidate fills the
     screen. ANGELA LANSBURY berates LAURENCE HARVEY.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                You're probably wondering how a
                girl like me arrived here at the
                ass end of the Nevada desert with
                a blood-spattered Winnebago and a
                one-armed man. To do that... I'll
                have to start at the beginning.

     Domino takes a sip of beer.

     IMAGES BLEED FROM THE PAST: A BARRAGE OF PHOTOGRAPHS from
     DOMINO'S CHILDHOOD in LONDON. PHOTOS of LAURENCE HARVEY and
     SOPHIE THOMAS (20s)... Domino's mother. SUPER-8 family footage
     bleeds into... a CHARITY FAIR... Harvey wins a RING TOSS and
     hands DOMINO (8) a PRIZE GOLDFISH in a bag of water... Domino
     places the GOLDFISH into a bowl... watches it from her bed at
     home as she goes to sleep. DOMINO... throwing a ROSE on the
     CASKET at her father's funeral.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                After dad passed on, Mum's agenda
                was to hit the town and find
                another husband with a boatload
                of cash.

     INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING

     Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling
     out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH.
     "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.

                          SOPHIE
                Be kind to your sitter.

     Domino glances back at a dowdy BRITISH NANNY (50s). She
     immediately walks over and turns off the television.

                          NANNY
                Time for bed... little one.

     Domino grits her teeth.


     INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- LATER THAT NIGHT

     Sophie comes stumbling into the apartment with a ROD STEWART
     look-alike. The NANNY is hog-tied with DUCT-TAPE on the couch.

     EXT. LONDON CATHOLIC SCHOOL -- DAY

     Sophie kisses Domino good-bye at the gate of the boarding
     school. Two NUNS approach... and she is left standing there
     alone with her GOLDFISH in its bowl.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                My mischief was cramping mum's
                husband hunting. She decided to
                sock me and my goldfish Sammy
                away in boarding school.

     INT. LONDON CATHOLIC SCHOOL -- DAY


     Domino sits on her bunk... staring at her goldfish. It begins to
     flail helplessly... floating to the top.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                A week later Sammy died. It was a
                pivotal moment in my life.

     INT. LONDON CATHOLIC SCHOOL -- BATHROOM -- NEXT

     Domino stands over the toilet with tears in her eyes. She drops
     the goldfish into the toilet.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                It was then that I realized God
                designed us all to perish. I
                decided to never invest too much
                emotion in one thing. It's always
                a set up to the pain of losing
                them.

     The CAMERA follows the dead goldfish down the toilet bowl and
     into an ABYSS OF SHIT. (Trainspotting)

     INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH CATHEDRAL -- DAYS LATER


     Domino (9) stands on the floor of a CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL with a
     group of Catholic school students on a field trip. She reaches
     out and steals a SILVER DOLLAR from the OFFERING PLATE...
     placing it in her pocket. A NUN eyes her suspiciously.

     Domino gazes up at the ceiling, at a painting of GOD staring
     back at her.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                God created me in his image.
                    (beat)
                I guess he had a thing for
                models.

     INT. LONDON FASHION SHOW - 1995 (POSS. DAVIS FACTOR STUDIO)
     (THE CULT - FIRE WOMAN)

     Domino (15) struts down the CATWALK at a fashion show. She
     looks gorgeous.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                I started on the runways in
                England.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Like most models, I was bored
                with life. I hated everything...
                and everyone.

     Another MODEL clips Domino in the shoulder as they pass one
     another on the catwalk.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                If you think America is dirtbag
                central... clearly you've never
                been to the sleaze-nation of our
                Queen mother.

     Domino turns around and grabs the girl by the hair. She screams
     out... clawin at Domino's face. They both tumble to the floor
     of the catwalk. People in the audience gasp in horror as
     FLASHBULBS erupt all around them.

     INT. LONDON APARTMENT - DAY


     On a BEC ENTERTAINMENT NEWS SHOW... the CAST of "BEVERLY HILLS
     90210" stands before a cheering crowd at a London shopping mall.
     Clips of all of the actors are shown. Sophie sits on the couch
     with a JACK RUSSELL TERRIER in her lap... smoking a cigarette.
     She seems enthralled with them.

                          SOPHIE
                Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.

     Behind her... Domino is playing with a pair of NUMB-CHUCKS...
     wearing her CATHOLIC SCHOOL UNIFORM.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Mum was determined to move us to
                Beverly Hills. That damn show
                started it all.

     IMAGE BLEED: A 747 descends over LOS ANGELES... Domino (16)
     peers through the window at the lights of the city... PALM
     TREES... SUNSHINE... RODEO DRIVE...

     EXT. BEVERLY HILLS MANSION -- DAY

     Domino (16) is in the back yard of a MANSION in BEVERLY
     HILLS. She is still playing with her NUMB-CHUCKS. Marc
     Osborne (40s) is chatting with friends around the pool.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                She re-married to a man named
                Marc Osborne. He invested in a
                restaurant called Planet
                Hollywood. We were never that
                close.

     STILL BLACK & WHITE IMAGE: Domino stands in front of a Planet
     Hollywood with Osborne, Sophie, ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER, BRUCE
     WILLIS, DEMI MOORE and SYLVESTER STALLONE.

     Sophie comes out onto the patio with the Jack Russell terrier
     under her arm... sipping a MARTINI.

                          SOPHIE
                Domino! Give the goddamn numb-
                chucks a rest already. It's time
                for supper!

     Sophie shakes her head in disgust as she moves back inside the
     mansion.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                I tried Beverly Hills High for a
                spell... but it didn't work out.

     INT. WEST BEVERLY HIGH -- BATHROOM -- DAY

     Domino is in a GNARLY CAT-FIGHT with this BEVERLY HILLS GIRL.
     Violent hair-pulling. Screaming crowd surrounds them. Tampons
     and hairbrushes are flying.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                I hated them. I hated them all.


     EXT. CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY -- SORORITY ROW -- DAY

     Domino (18) stands in front of the PI PHI HOUSE at sorority
     rush... as a group of gorgeous young women jump up and down...
     CLAPPING... SINGING SONGS.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                College was even worse. Mum
                convinced me to joined a
                sorority. It was all fun and
                games at first.

     INT. SORORITY HOUSE -- DAYS LATER

     Domino and the other PLEDGES are now lined up against the WALL
     in the back hall of the sorority house, all of them stripped
     down to their BRAS and PANTIES.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Then the hazing started.

     The same SORORITY GIRL has now become a VICIOUS PLEDGE TRAINER.

                          SORORITY GIRL
                Look at you fat fucking bitches.

     She walks up to a HEAVYSET GIRL with a BLACK MARKER in hand and
     begins to circle the CELLULITE on her ass. The girl is trembling
     with humiliation... tears flowing down her cheeks.

                          SORORITY GIRL (CONT'D)
                Look at this fucking fat! It's
                fucking disgusting!!!

     The Sorority Girl approaches an enraged Domino... who doesn't
     have an ounce of fat on her body.

                          SORORITY GIRL (CONT'D)
                Look at those mosquito bites.
                What's it like having the body of
                a ten year old boy?

     Domino leans in to analyze the girl's face.

                          DOMINO
                Did you get a nose job?

     DOMINO THEN PUNCHES HER IN THE FACE AS HARD AS SHE CAN. The girl
     falls against the wall... BLOOD gushing from her nose.

                          SORORITY GIRL
                AAHHH! OHHH MY GOD!!


     INT. SCHOOL COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAYS LATER

     Domino sits across from her SCHOOL COUNSELOR. Sophie is there
     next to her... looking completely BAFFLED.

                          COUNSELOR
                What is it about sorority life
                that bothers you?

                          DOMINO
                Everything. It is a ghastly
                existence.

                          SOPHIE
                Why must you fight... everything
                that is normal? You are blessed
                with such beauty. Life could be
                so easy... if only you allowed
                yourself to fit the mold.

                          DOMINO
                The mold? I am living among these
                crypto-fascist Orange County
                cunts... with daddy's BMW and the
                boob job... just waiting to
                implode.

                          SOPHIE
                Crypto-fascist? Who talks like
                this?!

                          DOMINO
                I refuse to turn out like them.
                Twenty-one years old and they're
                already looking for a husband.
                    (beat)
                Stupid fucking cunts with no self-
                esteem. They let the boys control
                their lives. Not me.

                          SOPHIE
                    (cringing)
                Must you use that awful word?

                          DOMINO
                Cunt.

                          SOPHIE
                Stop it.

                          DOMINO
                Cunt.

                          SOPHIE
                I said stop it.

                          DOMINO
                Cunt. It's just a word. Why does
                everyone in this fucking country
                get their knickers in a twist by
                the slightest bit of indecent
                conversation?

     The Therapist sighs to himself. He retrieves a SCANTRON TEST
     that she has filled out with the words "FUCK OFF". There is a
     big red "F" at the top.

                          THERAPIST
                This is your mid-term exam?

                          SOPHIE
                She's dyslexic. She's always had
                trouble with assignments.

     EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH -- SUNSET [CONCRETE BLONDE - JOEY]

     Domino sits alone on the beach... smoking a cigarette.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                A week later I was expelled.

     Newspapers and other TRASH blow across the sand toward Domino. A
     piece of an LA WEEKLY hits her shoulder. She grabs it...
     glancing down at the back page where there is an ADVERTISEMENT:


                    PROFESSIONAL BOUNTY HUNTERS WANTED

          $99 SEMINAR WITH BAIL BONDSMAN CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III!

     There is a picture of a OLDER BLACK MAN named CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III
     (50s) staring back at her. He is wearing a THREE-PIECE SUIT.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                In the end... it all came down to
                fate. An LA Weekly advert strewn
                across a desolate beach.

     The CAMERA moves in toward the picture of Claremont Williams
     III.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Claremont Williams III. The
                legendary bail bondsman. A few
                months later we met face to face.


     INT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTRE -- DAY

     Claremont Williams now stands before a PODIUM on the stage of a
     decrepit COMMUNITY CENTER in the city of Hawthorne.

                          CLAREMONT
                As a bail-bondsman... I am the go-
                between for the court and the
                criminal. For a ten percent
                fee... I will guarantee the
                amount set by the court.

     The room is filled with several dozen aspiring BOUNTY HUNTERS.
     Most of them are MEN... but there are a few WOMEN scattered
     about.

     INT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- LOBBY -- NEXT

     Domino approaches a TABLE set up in the LOBBY of the community
     center: Choco is sitting at the table.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                May I help you?

                          DOMINO
                Yes... I'm here for the bounty
                hunter seminar.

     Choco stares Domino up and down. She is wearing a TANK TOP...
     TIGHT JEANS and HIGH HEELS. A BELLY CHAIN rests just below her
     navel. She looks spectacular. Choco swallows hard.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                Ninety-nine dollars. Cash.

     Domino drops a HUNDRED onto the table.

                          DOMINO
                Keep the change.

     Choco watches Domino in awe as she struts into the community
     center... high heels CLACKING on the linoleum floor. It is love
     at first sight.

     INT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- NEXT

     Domino walks down the CENTER AISLE between the rows of chairs
     filled with the various assortment of BIKERS... EX-CONS...
     LOSERS and WANNABES hoping to become bounty hunters. (NOTE:
     Gusmano - real people casting)

                          CLAREMONT
                If the felon does a no-show on
                his trial date, I will bring in a
                bounty hunter to recapture the
                defendant or I will face having
                to pay the court myself.

     Claremont raises his eyes... noticing Domino as she works her
     way down the third row... searching for an open chair.

                          CLAREMONT (CONT'D)
                This occurs most frequently...
                because the collateral or
                guarantee given... to the bail
                bondsman... turns out to be
                worthless... or... uh...
                difficult to liquidate...
                    (beat)
                In layman's terms. We get ten
                percent of the bail.

     Claremont has entirely lost his train of thought. He cannot stop
     staring at Domino as she works her way to her seat. The entire
     room full of wannabes is staring at her as well. She could not
     look more out of place.

                          CLAREMONT (CONT'D)
                    (clearing his throat)
                In a few minutes... Ed Martin
                will take the stage and begin the
                seminar on how to become a bounty
                hunter.
                    (beat)
                Thank you.

     Polite APPLAUSE from the crowd. Domino pulls out a BRAND NEW
     SPIRAL NOTEBOOK and a BIC PEN... ready to take extensive notes.
     Next to her... a LOSER (40s) is gawking at her. He turns back to
     a conversation he was having with another LOSER.

                          LOSER #1
                    (licking his lips)
                Hot damn... I knew there were
                groupies... but I never thought
                they'd show up at a seminar.

                          LOSER #2
                    (to Domino)
                How about it? You want to ride
                some bounty hunter cock?

     Domino does not even look at him.

                          DOMINO
                Fuck you, douche-bag.

     Choco peers through the entrance from the lobby at Domino...


     INT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- LOBBY -- NEXT

     ...but is summoned back into the lobby by Ed, who is counting
     MONEY at the table. He drops the last stack of bills into a
     MANILA ENVELOPE.

     Ed looks to the front entrance. There are several WANNABES
     lurking around the entrance... smoking cigarettes and talking in
     small groups.

                          ED
                Alright. Time to ditch this
                thing. Did you take a look at the
                bathroom window?

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                I forgot.

                          ED
                For the love of God. Not Spanish
                again. Who's the girl?

     Ed throws Choco a quizzical look. Choco shrugs, looks away.
     Claremont struts through the lobby and Ed casually hands him his
     cut of the cash.

                          CLAREMONT
                Gentlemen, it has been a
                pleasure.

     Claremont walks out.

                          ED
                Bathroom window. Five minutes.
                I'll have the engine running.

     Choco grunts with displeasure as Ed moves toward the bathroom.
     96 FPS SLOW MOTION on Ed as he struts toward CAMERA:

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                If you hang out with Ed long
                enough, he'll tell you about
                Danang.
                He'll tell you about the North
                Vietnamese tunnel he found and
                the battle that ensued. This man
                is a warrior. That day in Danang
                made him one.

     INT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- NEXT

     Domino sighs impatiently... looking at her watch. The crowd is
     getting restless. A FAT WOMAN sitting in front of Domino begins
     to complain.

                          FAT WOMAN
                For Chrissakes... when is this
                thing gonna get started? I left
                my kids at Chuckie-fucking-Cheese
                and it's gonna close in an hour.
                What kind of piece of shit
                seminar is this?

     Domino looks at her watch and sighs.

     INT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- LOBBY -- MOMENTS LATER

     Domino comes into the lobby. Choco is no longer at the table.
     Domino sighs impatiently... looking at her watch.

     INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

     Domino is applying LIPSTICK in the bathroom mirror. There is a
     LOUD GROANING NOISE coming through the wall. Domino's eyes dart
     over to the wall. She puts her ear to the wall as the GROANING
     NOISES grow even louder.

     INT. MEN'S BATHROOM -- NEXT


     Domino pushes open the door to the MEN'S BATHROOM. She stares in
     disbelief as Choco is trying to wedge his body out the window.
     His ASS is stuck in the small window frame and his legs are
     wiggling back and forth as he tries to pull himself through.

                          DOMINO
                Motherfucker.

     She storms in... grabs Choco from behind just as he drops
     through... RIP!

     EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- NEXT

     ...and tries to pull Choco back in. 96 FPS SLOW MOTION on
     Choco's freaked out face:

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                To say that Choco is a product of
                a broken home is to presume a
                home existed in the first place.
                No, Choco never had a home.
                Not unless you count the ten or
                so juvenile correction facilities
                where he spent his childhood.

     Choco falls to the ground.

     INT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- LOBBY -- NEXT


     Domino storms through the lobby toward the exit... pushing her
     way through the group of WANNABES on cigarette break.

     EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER

     Domino rounds the corner of the building into the PARKING LOT...
     just as Choco pushes his way through the window frame and lands
     on the gravel.

     Domino watches Choco as he wipes the dirt from his clothes.
     HEADLIGHTS approach. It is a blue EL CAMINO. Ed is behind the
     wheel.

                          DOMINO
                What the fuck is this shit?

     Choco just stares at Domino... unsure what to do.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                Shit.

     Choco runs around the front of the El Camino and opens the
     passenger side door.

     INT. EL CAMINO -- NEXT


     Choco falls into the passenger seat and slams the door.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                Drive.

     Just as Ed puts the car into DRIVE... Domino steps into the path
     of the headlight beams and retrieves a 10 INCH HUNTING KNIFE
     from her purse. She HURLS the knife at the El Camino and it
     PLUNGES DEAD CENTER into the glass... SHATTERING the windshield
     in a spider-pattern.

     Ed and Choco stare incredulously at the 10 INCH BLADE that has
     pierced through the glass.

                          ED
                What the... who is this bitch?

     EXT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT

     Ed and Choco exit the El Camino just as Domino retrieves her
     knife from the windshield. She grips it in her right hand...
     threatening them.

                          DOMINO
                Where the fuck do you think
                you're going?

     Choco and Ed just stare at one another incredulously.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                These people paid good money for
                a seminar!

     Ed retrieves the ENVELOPE from his jacket and pulls out a
     HUNDRED DOLLARS.

                          ED
                You want your money back?
                    (holding out the bills)
                Here... take it.

     Domino considers her options.

                          DOMINO
                I don't want my fucking money
                back... I want a job.
                    (beat)
                You take me on as part of your
                team... or else.

     Ed laughs to himself.

                          ED
                Or else what?

     Domino whips out a pair of NUMB-CHUCKS from her purse and begins
     to WHIP them around her body in an elaborate display of numb-
     chuckery.  (NOTE: Find body double for Domino) Choco gawks at
     Domino. It is love at second sight for him... all over again.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                Holy shit... this bitch is
                fierce.

                          DOMINO
                I've been training since I was
                twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing
                stars. You name it... I can fight
                with it. I'm a hard worker and a
                fast learner.
                    (beat)
                Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid
                to die.

     Ed looks at Choco... shaking his head in disbelief.

                          ED
                You want to be a bounty hunter.
                Why does a pretty little thing
                like you want to be a bounty
                hunter?

                          DOMINO
                Because I want justice. I want to
                help put these sleazebags back in
                jail where they belong.
                    (smiles)
                And I want to have a little fun.

     Ed chuckles to himself.

                          ED
                Okay... Pretty Woman. I'll give
                you tonight. See if you can take
                it.

     Domino raises her knife.

                          DOMINO
                You can save that Pretty Woman
                shit. The name is Domino.

                          ED
                    (patronizing baby talk)
                Domino. Do you have a last
                name... Domino?

                          DOMINO
                No last names. Just Domino. The
                less you know about me the
                better, okay?

     Ed nods his head and opens the driver's side door.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                Where are we going?

                          ED
                On a raid. If she wants to see
                justice... we gonna take Domino
                to the Jungle, baby.

     EXT. JUNGLE -- NEXT

     The El Camino pulls into the entrance to the JUNGLE. The
     neighborhood of LOW INCOME HOUSES winds upward into the HILLSIDE
     adjacent to the wall. Ed parks the El Camino next to the curb.

     INT. EL CAMINO -- NEXT


     Choco retrieves a MUG SHOT from the glove compartment. Domino
     looks at a photograph of a man named CHARLES "COOKIE" KINCAID
     (19).

                          ED
                Bail jumper's name is Cookie
                Kincaid. Nineteen years old. His
                mommie posted bail when he was
                arrested for allegedly partaking
                in a drive-by shooting in
                Hawthorne.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                He killed two children.

                          ED
                    (throwing Choco a look)
                Fella takes out two kids and has
                the audacity to not show up for
                trial.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                We gotta bring him in.

                          ED
                Will you speak the fucking
                English language? The poor girl
                has no clue what you're talking
                about.
                    (to Domino)
                The boy speaks English, you know.
                Reads, writes, I swear it. He
                does this when he's around girls.
                Thinks it's cute.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                I'm gonna kill you, Ed.

     Ed turns back to Domino.

                          ED
                Tell him it's not cute. Will you
                tell him, Domino!?

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                Chinga te y tu mama tambien.

     Domino looks on as they go back and forth on each other at the
     top of their lungs. They are kinda' cute.

     EXT. TINA KINCAID'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

     They walk toward the front door. Ed rings the doorbell. TINA
     KINCAID (37) opens the front door. Ed holds up the mug shot.
     Tina stares at them through the screen.

                          ED
                You can make this easy, Tina...
                or you can make it real
                complicated. Your son is gonna be
                dead meat unless you let us bring
                him in.

     Tina slowly opens the screen door to let them into the house.

     INT. TINA KINCAID'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

     Tina sits on the couch across from Ed. Domino and Choco watch as
     she counts out the TWO-HUNDRED DOLLARS Ed has given her.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                For two-hundred dollars... Tina
                gave us her son's whereabouts. A
                local Gang-banger hideout up the
                street.


     EXT. JUNGLE -- LATER ON

     Domino stands with Ed and Choco at the TAILGATE of the El
     Camino. There is a SHELL mounted on the back of the truck bed. A
     remote control panel opens, revealing an arsenal of weapons. Ed
     retrieves three SHOTGUNS and hands them out.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                I could feel the blood coursing
                through my veins. Shotgun in
                hand, kicking down a door and
                wondering if there was heavy fire
                power on the other side.

     They begin their approach up the hill to Dexter house.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Turns out... my first raid was to
                be a near disaster.

     Domino reaches into her pocket and retrieves the SILVER DOLLAR
     that she stole from the Cathedral in London... rubbing it for
     good luck.


     INT. TINA KINCAID'S HOUSE -- NEXT

     Tina rushes into the MASTER BEDROOM.

                          TINA
                Cookie! Coast is clear baby.

     COOKIE KINCAID crawls out from underneath the bed.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                That bitch Tina set us up. The
                oreo cookie was hiding underneath
                her bed all along.

     Cookie grabs the TELEPHONE from the night stand and begins to
     dial a number.

     INT. DEXTER HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM -- NEXT

     Inside the DEXTER HOOSE... LARENZ "CREEP" DEXTER (20s) answers
     the phone.

                          CREEP
                Hello?

                          COOKIE (PHONE)
                Creep. It's Cookie. There's three
                Five-O's about to knock down your
                front door.

     Click. Dialtone. Creep's eyes widen in panic. That panic quickly
     turns to RAGE.

     INT. DEXTER HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

     Creep comes into the KITCHEN. There are SEVEN GANG-BANGERS in
     there watching TV. The place is swimming in FORTIES and BLUNTS.

                          CREEP
                Fuckin' Five-O.

     Everyone goes for their GUNS.

     EXT. DEXTER HOUSE -- NEXT

     Ed stands on the front porch, flanked by Domino and Choco,
     SHOTGUNS in hand.

                          ED
                Here we go.

     Ed KICKS DOWN the front door.

     INT. DEXTER HOUSE -- NEXT


     The BOUNTY HUNTER TRIO rushes through the FOYER into the
     KITCHEN... and immediately find themselves surrounded. The GANG-
     BANGERS all have their own GUNS pointed at them. (NOTE: Gusmano real
     people casting)

     MEXICAN STAND-OFF. A SCREAMING FURY ENSUES.

                          EVERYONE
                FREEZE MOTHERFUCKER... DROP THE
                MOTHERFUCKING GUN... WHERE THE
                FUCK IS COOKIE...

     SMASH CUT TO CATHEDRAL IN LONDON: Domino (9) stands among the
     nuns... staring up at the ceiling. The CRAZY NUN watches her.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                That night... my coin was tossed.
                Heads you live... tails you die.

     SMASH CUT TO CLOUDS: A SILVER DOLLAR SPINNING THROUGH THE AIR
     AGAINST CLOUDS ABOVE THE SUNSET.

     SHOTGUNS EXPLODE. BULLETS FLY.

     SHELLS TEAR INTO CHOCO... THEN ED... THEN DOMINO. BLOOD EXPLODES
     FROM THEIR BODIES. THEIR LIMBS FLAIL BACKWARDS AS THOUGH THEY
     ARE ATTACHED TO RAG DOLLS.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Fifty-fifty chance. Life or
                death. My destiny was life. Life
                as a bounty hunter.

     SMASH CUT TO CLOUDS: The SILVER DOLLAR spins through the clouds.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                This ain't Sunset Boulevard.

     The IMAGE REWINDS... the SHOTGUN SHELLS fly back into the
     barrels of the shotguns.

     BING.

     The IMAGE PLAYS IN FORWARD MOTION... this time the SCREAMING
     FRENZY DIES DOWN. Domino has lowered her gun and retrieved a
     BLUNT from the table. She takes a drag and exhales pot smoke
     into the room.

                          CREEP
                What is this shit?

     Domino stares at Creep... the ADRENALINE pumping through her
     veins. Mary Jane coursing through her lungs.

                          DOMINO
                We're not cops. We're bounty
                hunters. All we want is Cookie.
                You tell us where he is... and
                I'll...

     Creep darts his eyes back at the others.

                          CREEP
                And you'll what?

     Domino stares at Creep. She flips the silver dollar through her
     fingers... her mind racing.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Sometimes a girl has to be
                naughty in order to get herself
                out of a jam.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                I'll give you a lap dance. Bra
                and panties on.

     Creep licks his lips.

                          CREEP
                Awww shiiiitt. Girl... you be
                freakin' with me?

     Domino takes off her shirt. She then retrieves her BUTTERFLY
     KNIFE from her pocket

                          DOMINO
                You or your friends touch me...
                I'll cut your balls off.

     INT. DEXTER HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- LATER ON

     Domino is dancing seductively in the kitchen in a bra and BLACK
     G-STRING PANTIES. Creep is in a chair in the center of the room.
     Domino gyrates to the music... placing her BUTTERFLY KNIFE in
     her mouth. She gyrates on Creep's crotch. He thrusts his pelvis
     into her... loving every minute of it,

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                It worked. We got the scoop on
                how to find Cookie.

     Choco watches Domino in awe from the corner of the kitchen. Ed
     stands near her with his arms across his chest in disapproval.

     INT. SEEDY MOTEL ROOM -- DAY

     The Bounty Hunters break into a MOTEL ROOM and nail Cookie.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Two weeks later we nailed him.

     Domino and Ed HIGH FIVE as Choco cuffs the little bastard.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                From that day on... Eddie, Choco
                and I... we were inseparable.


     EXT. DMV -- SANTA MONICA -- DAY

     The CAMERA follows Ed, Choco and Domino as they approach the
     entrance to the DMV.

                          DOMINO
                Why are we going to the DMV?

                          ED
                The DMV is the de facto conduit
                for humanity.
                Every human being that we track
                down has a record in their
                database. Every other database...
                social security... credit
                bureau... LAPD... FBI... relies
                on the DMV as its hub. Claremont
                has people on the inside who feed
                us information.

     INT. DMV -- SANTA MONICA -- NEXT

     The group now moves through the DMV. The internal maze of
     cubicles filled with anonymous Government employees.

                          ED
                The rich... the poor... and
                everyone in between is a slave to
                this institution.

     Domino looks at all of the BLACK WOMEN working within the maze.

                          ED (CONT'D)
                And the gatekeepers of humanity
                turn out to be a bunch of fat,
                sassy black women.

     Choco leans in to whisper something in Domino's ear.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                Claremont fucks them all.

     Ed approaches one of the WINDOWS.

                          ED
                Hey Shantelle... have you seen
                Claremont?

                          SHANTELLE
                He's in the lounge with Keisha.


     INT. DMV -- LOUNGE -- NEXT

     Claremont has a woman named KEISHA bent over a chair in the
     lounge. He is fucking her hard from behind.

                          ROBOTIC FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                Now serving B023 at window number
                six.

     MONTAGE [MARLBORO ON ACID]:

     Ed and Choco chasing a REDNECK down an ALLEY... Domino tackles
     and handcuffs a MEXICAN MAN in a wife-beater in a RALPH'S
     PARKING LOT.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                After six months... Claremont
                hired Alf to drive us around...
                we were so busy.

     ALF pulls up in front of the BAIL BONDS OFFICE in a CHEVY
     IMPALA. The TEAM comes out of the entrance.

     Claremont counting STACKS OF MONEY at his desk with an old
     school ADDING MACHINE.

     The TEAM is on the road to TEXAS in a beat-up CHEVY IMPALA. Alf
     is behind the wheel. DOMINO MAKES EYE CONTACT WITH AN OLD INDIAN
     MAN AT A GAS STATION OUTSIDE OF BARSTOW. HE TIPS HIS HAT IN HER
     DIRECTION...

     The TEAM stands outside of a seedy TRAILER. Choco does a twenty
     yard sprint and LEAPS FORWARD feet first... exploding the
     trailer door off its upper hinges. A REDNECK inside leaps off
     the couch as they storm inside.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Sometimes we went as far east as
                Texas.

     The TEAM bursts into a TEXAS STRIP CLUB... GUNS BLAZING...

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                When there's cash on the table...
                the line between law enforcer and
                criminal becomes rather blurry.

     The TEAM collecting a BRIEFCASE FULL OF COCAINE from some TEXAS
     COPS in return for their bounty.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                Sometimes we'd accept seized
                narcotics for a payment instead
                of cash. The street re-sale value
                let us triple our payday.

     The TEAM knocking back drinks at a TEXAS HONKY TONK BAR. The
     "FOUR MUSKETEERS" high five. Domino rides the ELECTRONIC BULL...
     Choco watches as her G-STRING is exposed.


     EXT. MACDONALD'S PLAYLAND -- ARIZONA BORDER -- DAY

     TWO FBI AGENTS photograph Domino and Ed with a LONG LENS CAMERA
     as they sit at the outdoor patio of a MACDONALD'S PLAYLAND.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Little did I know that the FBI
                liked to keep tabs on us bounty
                hunters.

     Domino tears into a QUARTER POUNDER. Ed glances over at
     PLAYLAND. Choco is swimming through a SEA OF PLASTIC BALLS...
     frolicking with a bunch of MEXICAN CHILDREN.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                So Ed. What did you do before you
                became a bounty hunter?

                          ED
                I was a musician.

     Domino's eyes widen.

                          DOMINO
                Really? Did you play in a band?

                          ED
                Yeah. I played base guitar for
                Pat Benatar.

     Domino puts her hand to her chest.

                          DOMINO
                I... love... Pat Benatar.

                          ED
                Yeah?! Well... I loved her too.

                          DOMINO
                Oh my God... you mean... the two
                of you dated?!

                          ED
                We dated off and on for two
                years. But life on the road is
                tough. The pressure of the
                tour... relationships within a
                band... sometimes it leads to
                jealousy.

     Ed glances over at Choco. He is dunking a SCREAMING CHILD head
     first into the balls. The kids adore him.

     Domino looks over at Choco in the sea of balls.

                          DOMINO
                How did you meet Choco?

                          ED
                I found him pan-handling on Third
                Street Promenade.
                Took him under my wing. We been
                hunting together ever since.

     Choco arrives from Playland. His clothes are all wet.

                          ED (CONT'D)
                Jesus Christ! What's that smell?

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                The children like to urinate in
                the balls.

                          ED
                Fuckin' A! We got a five hour
                drive back to LA ahead of us.

     EXT. MACDONALD'S -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER

     Choco is now stripped down to his boxer shorts in the back
     PARKING LOT of the MacDonald's. Alf is hosing him down. Domino
     stares at Choco... admiring his body.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                We may have been dysfunctional,
                but we worked. We were family.

     INT. GHETTO HOUSE -- NIGHT

     A GANG-BANGER has a SHOTGUN pointed at Choco's face, staring Ed
     down.

                          GANG-BANGER (IN SPANISH)
                ONE STEP CLOSER AND I'LL BLOW HIS
                FUCKING FACE OFF!

     Ed, sweat pouring down his temple, stays put. Domino approaches
     the Gang-banger from behind, places her pistol to his head.

                          DOMINO
                Put... the gun... down.

     Choco sticks his finger into the shotgun barrel.

                          GANG-BANGER (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                D'fuck you think you're doing?

                          ED
                Choco... what are you doing...

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                He's full of shit.

     Choco then removes his finger and places his forehead against
     the shotgun.

                          CHOCO (CONT'D)
                Do it. I dare you.

     The Gang-banger, freaked out, lowers his shotgun. Ed swallows
     hard, then moves in to cuff him.


     MONTAGE [MARLBORO ON ACID]:

     Choco... in the lounge of the DMV... BREAK-DANCING. He is
     surrounded by FAT, SASSY BLACK WOMEN cheering him on. Raoul
     squeals with excitement.

     Domino in a NIGHTCLUB... POSING UNDERCOVER. She takes a GUY in
     the MEN'S BATHROOM... CHOCO EMERGES FROM A STALL WITH A GUN.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                In 2003 I was named Bounty Hunter.
                of the year.

     Claremont presents Domino with a PLAQUE at the HAWTHORNE
     COMMUNITY CENTER in front of 50 WANNABE BOUNTY HUNTERS.

                and grace to our profession.
                Domino Harvey.

     Huge applause. Claremont hugs Domino. A tear traces her cheek.

     EXT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BACK PATIO -- DAY


     Domino has thrown a huge POOL PARTY at her mother's mansion.

     Alf floats in the pool... passed out drunk on an air mattress.

     On the other side of the pool... RAOUL has a bunch of his
     HOMEMADE JEWELRY laid on blankets for sale. His HAIR SALON
     FRIENDS are sifting through it. Others are getting their TURBO
     NAILS done.

     Claremont sits with Ed and Choco at a table... playing CARDS.
     Claremont takes a puff off his cigar.

                          CLAREMONT
                Check out the luscious action by
                the pool.

     Lateesha & VARIOUS FRIENDS are all dancing by the side of the
     pool with MARGARITAS in hand. Ed looks at Lateesha's BEHIND.

                          ED
                Claremont, you're a chubby
                chaser.

                          CLAREMONT
                You white folks don't understand
                the natural beauty of a woman's
                figure. Those are birthing hips.
                More cushion for the pushin'.

     Lateesha winks at Claremont from across the pool. He goes over
     to dance with her.

     Ed and Choco see Domino emerge from the pool in her Bikini. She
     looks astonishing.

                          ED
                Now that's an ass.

     Choco stares at her... hopelessly in love.

     Across the PATIO... Sophie arrives home from out of town with
     her NEW BOYFRIEND. She looks at the party... completely
     flabbergast.

                          SOPHIE
                Good lord.

     EXT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- MASTER BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT

     Sophie rolls over in bed... unable to sleep. TECHNO MUSIC blares
     from downstairs. She removes the silk mask from her eyes and
     turns on the television.

     INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- FAMILY ROOM -- NEXT

     Domino and a shirtless Choco are dancing in the family room.
     Choco is flipping NEON BLUE GLOW-STICKS around in his hands like
     a rave rat. Domino is flipping her SILVER DOLLAR through her
     fingers.

     Choco snaps open one of the glow sticks and pours the neon
     liquid into his mouth... rubbing it on his teeth with his index
     finger. He smiles at Domino, teeth glowing NEON like a Mexican
     angel. She laughs at this.

     LATER ON... Domino and Ed slow dance to BARRY WHITE. Ed lowers
     his hands down to cup Domino's ass. She removes them. Choco
     looks on jealously from across the room.


     INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- GUEST BEDROOM -- LATER ON

     Domino helps put a drunken Ed into the guest bed. Through the
     door... Choco watches them. Ed kicks the door closed.

     Choco punches his fist through a glass door.

     EXT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- EARLY MORNING

     Ed's El Camino sits in front of Pauline's mansion. He and
     Choco are sitting in the car, hung over.

     Choco nurses a bandaged hand as a NEIGHBOR comes jogging by,
     glaring at them. They stick out like a sore thumb.

                          ED
                Fella could get used to a life
                this ordinary.

                          CHOCO
                Maybe you should fuck her mom
                then.

     Choco angrily steps out of the car and lights a cigarette.

                          ED
                What the fuck is your problem?
                Bitch!!

     INT. SOPHIE TROMAS MANSION -- KITCHEN -- DAY

     Domino is loading her GUN at the kitchen table as Sophie serves
     breakfast. Domino wolfs it down.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Mum was terrified for me. She
                didn't approve of my lifestyle
                one bit.

                          SOPHIE
                So who is this Choko? Is he your
                new boyfriend?

                          DOMINO
                It's Choco. And he's not my
                boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.

                          SOPHIE
                Whatever. He's a criminal. And
                this Ed Martin character is a
                complete loser.

                          DOMINO
                He used to date Pat Benatar!

     She grabs her gun and leaves.

     EXT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- NEXT

     Choco paces around angrily with his cigarette.

                          CHOCO
                So?

                          ED
                So what?

                          CHOCO
                You know what I'm talking about,
                did you fuck her?

     Ed shakes his head in disbelief.

                          ED
                What do you think?

     They suddenly realize Domino is standing there at the curb.

                          DOMINO
                Morning.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                Morning.


     INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT

     Taryn removes a HEAD SHOT of a MAN (40s) with glasses.

                          TARYN
                Do you know this man?

                          DOMINO
                He's a reality television
                producer. His name is Mark Weiss.

                          TARYN
                Mr. Weiss was very generous in
                turning over some video tapes to
                the FBI. There's lots of footage
                of you. We know everything.
                    (beat)
                If you don't come clean... the
                information on these tapes could
                send you to prison for a very
                long time.

     The CAMERA moves in toward Domino's face.

     VIDEO IMAGE: A FAT RED-NECK is being chased by a BIKER through a
     SHOPPING MALL. The Redneck SLAMS into two FAT WOMEN eating ICE
     CREAM CONES... slowing him down.

                          FAT WOMAN
                EEEHH!!!

     The Biker TACKLES him to the ground among SCREAMING SHOPPERS.

                          BIKER
                YOU'RE GOING DOWNTOWN
                MOTHER(BLEEP)ER!

     A FLASHY REALITY TV LOGO SLAMS ON THE SCREEN.

     INT. FOX TELEVISION STUDIOS -- SEVERAL DAYS BEFORE

     A PRODUCER named MARK WEISS (40s) stands in a large, bustling
     CONTROL ROOM... staring at the wall of MONITORS.

                          WEISS
                    (to himself)
                They changed the fucking font.

     TECHNICIANS and ASSISTANTS move throughout the room. Weiss grabs
     his ASSISTANT, KIMMIE (20s), as she walks by.

                          WEISS (CONT'D)
                Get Cynthia on the line. They
                changed the fucking font.

                          KIMMIE
                Okay.
                    (beat)
                Domino Harvey is here.

                          WEISS
                Send her through to the
                conference room.

     INT. FOX TELEVISION STUDIOS -- LOBBY -- NEXT


     Domino, Ed, Choco and Sophie are in the LOBBY. Sophie is holding
     her JACK RUSSELL TERRIER.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Mark Weiss was friends with Mum.
                He heard my story at some
                cocktail party. Turns out he
                wanted to put us on television.
                Mum was horrified at the idea and
                demanded to tag along just to
                keep me from signing anything.

     Kimmie comes through the lobby.

                          KIMMIE
                Oh! I wasn't expecting the whole
                entourage. Are you guys ready?
                Come on back.

     INT. FOX TELEVISION STUDIOS -- NEXT

     Domino and her ENTOURAGE follow Kimmie through the vast studio.

                          KIMMIE
                Now... I should warn you, Mr.
                Weiss will only be able to meet
                for about five minutes... so
                let's make sure to cut to the
                point.
                    (whispering)
                I recommend speaking in short
                sentences. He has the attention
                span of a ferret on crystal meth.

     Kimmie smiles at Ed and Choco as she opens the door to the
     CONFERENCE ROOM:

                          ED
                I've seen that.

                          KIMMIE
                Beg pardon?

                          ED
                A ferret on crystal meth. It bit
                this girl named Tammi right on
                the ass. It got lockjaw and we
                had to pry the ferret off her ass
                with a pair of pliers.
                    (beat)
                She had to get a tetanus shot.

     Kimmie turns away in disgust.

     INT. FOX TELEVISION STUDIOS -- CONFERENCE ROOM -- LATER ON


     The GROUP sits silently around the CONFERENCE ROOM TABLE. Weiss
     comes into the room.

                          WEISS
                Guys... sorry about the wait...
                I'm having font issues.

     Weiss takes a seat.

                          WEISS (CONT'D)
                Let me just cut to the chase
                here... as I have to take a
                conference call.
                    (switching to "pitch" mode)
                We want to follow you around with
                a camera crew for a week. Our
                pilot episode isn't testing well.
                We've got too many rednecks. It's
                too much like Cops.

                          WEISS (CONT' D)
                We need something sexy...
                something different. We need...
                Domino.

     Ed has his arms folded across his chest.

                          ED
                We won't do it unless the whole
                team gets equal coverage.

                          SOPHIE
                You're not her father, Ed. No one
                cares what you think.

                          ED
                It can't be just her. We're a
                team and we work together.

     Weiss smiles at them all.

                          WEISS
                Sure. Okay. We'll follow the
                whole team.

     Sophie sighs loudly.

                          SOPHIE
                Mark... what guarantee can you
                give us that Domino's name won't
                be tarnished?

                          WEISS
                Sophie... this is reality
                television. What you see is what
                you get.

                          SOPHIE
                But you can edit things... add
                sound-bytes... fabricate this...
                exaggerate that. These programs
                are all about shock value. It
                won't be long before someone gets
                killed.

                          WEISS
                I'm just giving America what it
                wants to see. People are tired of
                fiction. They want reality.

     Sophie turns to Domino.

                          SOPHIE
                You will be exploited. Your story
                will not be told accurately. Your
                life will never be the same.
                    (taking Domino's hand)
                I beg you not to take part in
                this drivel.

                    (holding up her other hand to
                     Weiss)
                No offense Mark... but we both
                know that this is drivel.

     Weiss smiles bitterly. The TELEPHONE rings.

                          WEISS
                None taken.
                    (holding up his hand)
                Talk it over. I have to take this
                conference call.

     Weiss hits the SPEAKERPHONE button.

                          WEISS (CONT'D)
                Cynthia... you changed the
                fucking font on the promo. Why?

     As Cynthia babbles on with some shitty excuse... Domino and the
     others are quietly debating their decision.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                I felt like a hypocrite, given my
                hatred of all things Hollywood.
                But I'll admit... I wanted my
                story told. I wanted everyone to
                know the things I'd done. I
                wanted some recognition in the
                world.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                We'll do it.

     Weiss smiles at Domino... giving her the thumbs up. He hits the
     button on the speakerphone.

                          SOPHIE
                God help us. God help us all.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                It was the beginning of the end.

     The CAMERA MOVES in toward Domino's face.

     EXT. RV DEALERSHIP -- EARLY MORNING

     [FATBOY SLIM -- THE WEEKEND STARTS HERE]

     HUNDREDS of WINNEBAGOS stretch out into an endless parking lot.
     A GIGANTIC AMERICAN FLAG billows in the wind above them all.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                On Wednesday morning, Kimmie took
                us to buy a new winnebago for Alf
                to drive. Fox wasn't too keen on
                the Impala. They wanted something
                that could house a camera crew.

     In the PARKING LOT... Domino, Ed, Choco, Kimmie and the RV
     DEALER watch as Alf recklessly maneuvers a WINNEBAGO through a
     series of CONES set up on the ASPHALT.

                          RV DEALER
                    (cringing)
                This vehicle isn't intended for
                high speeds and intense turns.
                It's for recreational use...
                vacations...

     The Winnebago skids around the last cone as Alf pulls a sudden
     U-turn... the back end of the RV fishtailing counter-clockwise.

                          DOMINO
                We aren't going on vacation.

     The Winnebago comes skidding to a stop. Alf jumps out... shrugs
     his shoulders and raises his THUMB.

                          KIMMIE
                We'll take it.

     EXT. DOWNTOWN GARAGE ROOFTOP -- MIDDAY


     A CADILLAC ESCALADE pulls up to the top of a PARKING GARAGE
     overlooking DOWNTOWN. IAN ZIERING (30s) and BRIAN AUSTIN GREEN
     (30s) emerge from inside.

                          ZIERING
                We're late.

                          GREEN
                Fucking Map Quest. Never again.

     EXT. DOWNTOWN GARAGE ROOFTOP -- NEXT

     Ziering and Green approach a LARGE TENT. The WINNEBAGO is parked
     off to the side. Alf is inside... doing something with a WELDER
     on the front of the RV.

     Under the tent... Domino and her team are lounging on several
     COUCHES... watching television. There is a CRAFT SERVICE
     TABLE... WARDROBE... MAKE-UP and a CAMERA CREW milling about.
     Mark Weiss is talking with Kimmie when he notices Ziering and
     Green.

                          WEISS
                Hey guys! I want you to meet
                Domino.

     Weiss walks them over to Domino. The CAMERA CREW follows.

                          WEISS (CONT'D)
                Domino... I want you to meet the
                co-hosts of Bounty Hunters... Ian
                Ziering and Brian Austin Green.

     In SLOW MOTION... Green shakes Domino's hand. She regards him
     with awe... her eyes wide like saucers.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Fucking 90210. I couldn't get
                away from it.

     Domino shakes hands with Green.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                It wasn't until later on that I
                realized mum had gotten to Weiss
                and pulled some strings.

     Ziering and Green smile politely as they shake hands with Choco
     and Ed. Choco is nervous... refusing to make eye contact.

                          ZIERING
                We're ready whenever you are,
                Mark.

     Weiss puts his hand on Domino's shoulder.

                          WEISS
                The guys are going to conduct
                some interviews.

     Kimmie approaches with a sense of anxiety.

                          KIMMIE
                Mark... uh... the gentleman from
                Afghanistan has done some...
                significant alterations to the
                RV.

     The GROUP turns its attention to the Winnebago.

     ON THE RIGHT SIDE of the vehicle... Alf has AIRBRUSHED a
     GIGANTIC AFGHANISTAN NATIONAL FLAG. Standing in front of the
     flag are three AIRBRUSHED WOMEN IN AMERICAN FLAG BIKINIS
     teaching an AFGHANI WOMAN how to dance. She is wearing an
     AFGHANI FLAG BIKINI.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Alf grew up during the Russian
                invasion of Afghanistan. He had
                always wanted to be part of the
                revolution... but it seemed to
                pass him by.

     EXT. AFGHANISTAN -- [FLASHBACK] 1979

     ALF (17) sits on a rock on the outskirts of a small village in
     Afghanistan. A RUSSIAN TANK blows past. Alf holds up an M-16.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                At the tender age of seventeen he
                decided that explosives would be
                his specialty.


     EXT. AFGHANISTAN VILLAGE -- DAYS LATER

     IMAGE BLEED: Alf rigging DYNAMITE with make-shift fuses... a
     group of KIDS (8-12) watch him curiously... ALF stands before an
     abandoned HOUSE rigging the fuse to a DETONATOR... The KIDS
     surrounding him back away.

     Alf goes to retrieve the fuses from the dirt and drops the
     detonator... setting off a HUGE EXPLOSION that obliterates the
     house... his body goes flying as he is nearly engulfed in
     flames.

     As DEBRIS rains down, Alf just lays there in the dirt... his
     eyebrows singed off. The Kids approach him curiously.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                His eyebrows never grew back.

     EXT. DOWNTOWN GARAGE ROOFTOP -- NEXT

     Weiss moves around to the front of the Winnebago. Alf has
     MOUNTED several HUMAN SKULLS as HOOD ORNAMENTS on the vehicle.
     Various HUMAN BONES are attached to the HOOD in an ORNATE
     DESIGN.

                          WEISS
                Are those... real bones?

     Alf nods his head politely.

                          ALF
                For my family.
                    (beat)
                I drive these bounty hunters...
                for a free Afghanistan.

     Ziering looks at Green in shock.

                          ZIERING
                Whoa. I didn't know this was a
                political show.

     Weiss bites his fingernails.

                          WEISS
                I think... that the network is
                going to have some notes... about
                the RV.

     Domino puts her hand on Weiss's shoulder.

                          DOMINO
                No notes. This is our Winnebago.
                It stays like this... or I walk.

     Weiss sees that she means business.

                          WEISS
                Okay.

     Alf nods his head to Weiss with a look of gratitude.

     EXT. DOWNTOWN GARAGE ROOFTOP -- LATER ON

     ON CAMERA INTERVIEWS. The Crew sits across from Ziering and
     Green.

                          ZIERING
                So... how'd you get the name
                Choco?

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                I once choked a man to death.

     Ziering nods his head politely.

                          ZIERING
                Uhhh... I have no idea what you
                just said.

                          ED
                SPEAK ENGLISH! JESUS CHRIST WE'RE
                ON TELEVISION HERE!

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                They can do subtitles.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Choco grew up on the streets of
                El Salvador. When he was four
                years old... he stabbed another
                kid in the eye-ball with a
                pencil.
                    (beat)
                There were wires crossed
                somewhere in his soul.

                          GREEN
                What kind of background does
                someone need in order to become a
                bounty hunter?

                          ED
                How about a life in the military?

     CLOSE UP: ED'S SANDALS REVEAL A MISSING TOE.

                          GREEN
                Is that how you lost the toe?

                          ED
                Indeed. I served three tours in
                Vietnam.

                          ZIERING
                Three tours? Isn't that... twelve
                years?

                          ED
                Son, with the exception of Spring
                Break in Tijuana, have you ever
                ventured outside of California?

                          ZIERING
                Many times.

                          ED
                Do you know where Danang is?

                          ZIERING
                Not really.

                          ED
                ...THEN SHUT THE FUCK UP!


     INT. FBI SURVEILLANCE ROOM -- MOMING

     A group of FBI AGENTS sit before a set of TELEVISION MONITORS.

     ON THE TELEVISION: RICKI LAKE talks to the CAMERA.

                          RICKI
                With us today are mixed race
                single mothers. Our next guest
                takes pride in the fact that she
                is in the Guinness book of world
                records as the youngest American
                grandmother... at the age of 28.

     Outrage from the RICKI crowd.

                          RICKI (CONT'D)
                Please welcome... Lateesha
                Rodriguez!

     Lateesha takes the stage. Even more outrage. BOOS from the
     crowd.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Lateesha was one of Claremont's
                many mistresses.

     The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH THE TELEVISION SCREEN.

     INT. RICKI LAKE SHOW -- SEVERAL WEEKS BEFORE

     The CAMERA MOVES through the LIVE TAPING of the show as it
     occurred several weeks before.

                          RICKI
                Lateesha... what do you have to
                say for yourself?

                          LATEESHA
                I am here today to speak for all
                people of mixed race in America.
                As a Blacktino woman, I believe
                that we deserve our own race
                category... so that we can forge
                an identity.

     An OUTRAGED WOMAN stands up in the crowd.

                          OUTRAGED WOMAN
                Excuse me, did you just say...
                Blacktino?

                          LATEESHA
                Yes I did. I am a Blacktino
                American.

                          OUTRAGED WOMAN
                First of all... you don't even
                look Latino. You look black. I am
                mixed race. I have struggled my
                whole life as to whether I am
                black... or Chinese.

                          LATEESHA
                Chinegro.

     Outrage from the crowd.

                          OUTRAGED WOMAN
                CHINEGRO? DID YOU JUST CALL ME
                CHINEGRO?

                          LATEESHA
                Mixed race individuals such as
                myself and my child... my
                grandchild... deserve a
                recognized category.

                          RICKI
                Lateesha has brought her own
                mixed race flow chart.

     HIP-HOP BLARES as two LOW RENT CHIPPENDALES REJECTS waltz across
     the stage with Lateesha's FLOW CHART. On it... she has created
     CATEGORIES for each variation of BLACK/HISPANIC/ASIAN descent
     and their SUB-CATEGORIES.

                          LATEESHA
                Blacktino... Blackasian...
                Hispasian... and the Asian sub-
                categories... Chinegro...
                Koreagro... Japegro...
                Chispanic... Koreaspanic... and
                last but not least... Japanic.

     Outrage from the crowd.

                          RICKI
                You believe that our government
                should recognize these racial sub-
                categories?

                          LATEESHA
                Yes.

     Ricki shoves her mike in the face of an OUTRAGED BLACK WOMAN.

                          OUTRAGED BLACK WOMAN
                These sub-categories are racist.
                You're excluding all of the mixed
                race people who have more than
                two racial identities. People
                like Mariah Carey and Vin Diesel.
                Where is their category?

                          LATEESHA
                This is only the beginning. We
                must appeal to the United Nations
                to create categories for every
                permutation of mixed race
                individual.

     More outrage from the crowd. A BLACKTINO WOMAN grabs the mike
     from Ricki.

                          BLACKTINO WOMAN
                First of all... from one
                Blacktino woman to another... our
                concern is not these ridiculous
                categories. Our concern is
                education and family planning.
                Here you are a 28 year-old
                grandmother. You need to add
                another category to your flow
                chart... it's called birth
                control, bitch!

     Blacktino Woman SNAPS her fingers. The crowd goes wild.

                          LATEESHA
                I AM EDUCATED, YOU BLACKTINO
                BITCH! I AM A DEVRY GRADUATE! MY
                DAUGHTER IS A SINGLE MOTHER AND A
                STRAIGHT A STUDENT!

                          BLACKTINO WOMAN
                WHO YOU CALLING BITCH! I'LL KICK
                YOUR ASS! BITCH-ASS BLACK-TIN-HO!

     THE CROWD IS ON ITS FEET CHEERING.

                          RICKI
                LADIES! PLEASE!


     INT. RODRIGUEZ HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- DAY

     The CAMERA PULLS BACK from a 46 INCH TELEVISION SCREEN in
     LATEESHA'S HOUSE... broadcasting the same network.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Lateesha was our prime contact at
                the DMV. Most of our bond
                certificates came from Claremont
                through her.

                          RICKI
                We'll be right back after this.

     Lateesha is sitting on the couch next to Claremont and her
     DAUGHTER... KEE KEE RODRIGUEZ (14). Next to Kee Kee is Raoul.
     Next to Raoul are Lateesha's TWIN COUSINS... LASHANDRA DAVIS
     (23) and LASHINDRA DAVIS (23).

                          LASHANDRA
                You were good.

                          LASHINDRA
                Real good.

                          RAOUL
                I liked the way Ricki's stylists
                did your hair.

                          LASHANDRA
                It looked good.

                          LASHINDRA
                Real good.

     Kee Kee turns off the TV with the REMOTE. She storms out of the
     room onto the terrace.

                          LATEESHA
                What?


     EXT. DOOR -- APARTMENT BLOCK TERRACE -- DAY

                          KEE KEE
                I have never been more humiliated
                in my entire life.

                          LATEESHA
                Kee Kee!

                          CLAREMONT
                She's right... you lost your
                temper... and you started cursing
                like some ghetto skank. You lost
                all credibility right there!

                          LATEESHA
                That bitch called me a bitch.

                          LASHANDRA
                Ain't nobody gonna call me a
                bitch without some payback.

                          LASHINDRA
                Nobody.

                          RAOUL
                Did you see that bitch's hair?

     Kee Kee holds her hand up in outrage.

                          KEE KEE
                You were supposed to talk about
                the health care crisis in
                America.

                          CLAREMONT
                Exactly. Why would you choose
                Ricki Lake as a platform for a
                progressive race modification
                proposal?

                          LATEESHA
                You think Ted Koppel is gonna
                book Lateesha Rodriguez?

                          LASHANDRA
                Not a chance.

                          LASHINDRA
                Not a chance in hell.

                          RAOUL
                Not with that toupee of his.

                          LATEESHA
                Ricki is one of the only forums
                that our people have. The more
                face time I get on Ricki the
                better chance for a book deal or
                a correspondence gig on BET.

                          LASHANDRA
                That bitch Jenny Jones got
                cancelled.

                          LASHINDRA
                Montel would've been better.

                          RAOUL
                Oprah don't book ghetto, Kee Kee.

     Kee Kee throws her hands up in outrage.

                          KEE KEE
                It was embarrassing. I'm gonna
                get shot when I go to school
                tomorrow, Momma!
                    (near tears)
                How could you do this to me?

     Claremont walks over to a METAL OXYGEN CHAMBER. The metal
     sarcophagus from the 80's is the housing for his sleeping 
     granddaughter

                          KEE KEE (CONT'D)
                Dad... we need money.

     Claremont looks down at his grand-daughter.

                          CLAREMONT
                How much is the operation?

                          KEE KEE
                Three hundred thousand dollars.

                          LASHANDRA
                Kee Kee... this motherfucka got
                more kids running 'round out
                there than Evander-fucking-
                Holyfield. He can't pay for shit.

     DING-DONG. The DOORBELL is ringing.

                          KEE KEE
                I'll get it.

     Kee Kee storms off toward the front door.

     INT. RODRIGUEZ HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT


     Kee Kee opens the front door as far as the CHAIN LOCK will
     allow. She peers through the crack. Domino is standing there.

                          KEE KEE
                Well if it isn't Miss Thang.

                          DOMINO
                Save it, Kee Kee. Where's
                Lateesha? We need to ID some bond
                certificates.

     INT. RODRIGUEZ HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- NEXT

     Claremont paces around the family room.

                          CLAREMONT
                I've already formulated a plan.

                          LATEESHA
                What?

                          CLAREMONT
                My armored car business. We just
                signed a new insurance policy in
                Nevada. There's a loophole.

                          LATEESHA
                There's always a loophole with
                you, Claremont. Your black ass is
                one big loophole.

     INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- [FLASH FORWARD] NIGHT


     Taryn continues to grill Domino.

                          TARYN
                Are you aware that Lateesha
                Rodriguez has been running a
                counterfeit driver's license
                racket?

                          DOMINO
                That's the rumor on the street.

                          TARYN
                What was your business with
                Lateesha that day?

                          DOMINO
                We needed to verify some bond
                certificates for Claremont. She
                pushes stuff through the system
                for us... helps us track down
                perps for a kick back. It's all
                legal.

     INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- [FLASHBACK] DAY


     Domino is behind the wheel. Lateesha sits shotgun. Kee Kee is in
     the back seat.

                          TARYN (V.O.)
                You drove Lateesha's daughter to
                school... then dropped her off at
                the DMV. Why?

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Her car was in the shop.

     Raoul pulls up next to them in his MAZDA MIATA.

                          RAOUL
                Teesha... the J-Lo tickets go on
                sale today!

                          LATEESHA
                I have the web link. We'll order
                tickets. You can be my date.

     Raoul gives her a THUMBS UP and steps on the gas.

                          LATEESHA (CONT'D)
                    (to Kee Kee)
                Maybe I'll marry Raoul.

     Kee Kee is shaking her head in disbelief.

                          KEE KEE
                Mom... Raoul is gay. When are you
                gonna face up to reality?

                          LATEESHA
                Kee Kee... me and Claremont are
                working an a plan to get same
                money to care for Meeka.

     INT. DMV -- MANAGER'S OFFICE -- NEXT


     Lateesha sits across the desk from AHMED (40s)... the DMV
     MANAGER. This is Lateesha's bass.

                          AHMED
                How convenient that the morning
                you call in sick... I turn on the
                TV and see you all over Ricki
                Lake. Ever heard of Tivo?

                          LATEESHA
                You think I can afford Tivo?
                Give me a break, Ahmed. What do
                you want? I got work to do.

                          AHMED
                I got a call yesterday from our
                health care provider.
                They said you tried to pass your
                grand-daughter off as Kee Kee
                down at UCLA Medical Center.

     Lateesha does not respond.

                          AHMED (CONT'D)
                They said you forged the age on
                the application for some sort of
                operation.

                          LATEESHA
                Motherfuckin' HMO don't cover
                grandchildren. What am I supposed
                to do? The operation costs three
                hundred thousand dollars. Where
                am I gonna get that kind of
                money?

                          AHMED
                Maybe you should have thought
                about that before you became a
                grandmother.

     Ahmed shakes his head in disgust.

                          AHMED (CONT'D)
                You have two weeks to clean out
                your desk.

     Tears are welling in Lateesha's eyes.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                It just kept getting worse for
                Lateesha. No one could have
                expected what happened next.

                          AHMED
                In the meantime Lateesha... there
                are two gentlemen from the FBI
                here who'd like to speak with
                you.

     Ahmed rises to his feet and opens the door to his office. TWO
     FBI AGENTS enter the office. Their names are CHRIS ESPINOZA
     (30s) and DAWN COSGROVE (30s). Both are wearing dark suits.


     INT. DMV -- NEXT

     Raoul watches them outside of the window.

                          DOMINO (V. O. )
                Their names were Cosgrove and
                Espinoza. Someone had tipped them
                off to Lateesha's counterfeit
                scam. But that's not what they
                were really after.

     Ahmed closes the door. Lateesha lights a Virginia Slim... turbo
     nails trembling.

     INT. DMV -- MANAGER'S OFFICE -- NEXT

     Cosgrove offers her a broad smile. Espinoza takes the BAD COP
     role.

                          ESPINOZA
                You're gonna go to jail for a
                long... long time, Lateesha.

                          COSGROVE
                Unless you cooperate with us.
                Espinoza sits on the edge of the desk.

                          LATEESHA
                I'm listening.

     Cosgrove glances at Espinoza.

                          ESPINOZA
                In about ten minutes... a college
                kid named Frances is gonna walk
                up to your window and ask for
                four counterfeit IDs.

                          COSGROVE
                We want to know what he's up to.

     Lateesha takes another drag.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                This was the moment that Lateesha
                decided to do something very
                foolish.

     She stares at Cosgrove and Espinoza for a long moment...
     thinking about her options.

                          LATEESHA
                He and his three friends are
                gonna hijack an armored truck.
                They're gonna walk away with ten
                million in cash.

     INT. DMV -- WINDOW SIX -- MOMENTS LATER

     Raoul glances suspiciously at Lateesha as she exits the
     Manager's office with the FBI. Lateesha approaches hurriedly and
     sits down at her desk at WINDOW SIX.

     BING.

                          ROBOTIC FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                Now serving G086. Please report
                to window six.

     Lateesha tries to remain calm. She begins to file her nails.
     FRANCES arrives at her window. He clears his throat nervously.

                          FRANCES
                Kee Kee.

     Lateesha raises her eyes...

                                                       FADE TO BLACK:

     EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAWN

     HELICOPTER SHOT: The CAMERA SOARS over the NEVADA DESERT
     LANDSCAPE. The MOUNTAIN RIDGES carve intricate shapes with the
     shadows cast by the morning sun.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                There are three kinds of people
                in the world. The rich... the
                poor... and everyone in between.

     The CAMERA CRESTS a ridge. The early morning lights of the
     HOOVER DAM approach.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                The rich people hate the poor...
                because they are always stealing
                from them.

     The CAMERA DROPS DOWN into the depths of the Hoover Dam.


     EXT. HOOVER DAM -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT

     Several LVPD POLICE CRUISERS are parked around an ARMORED TRUCK.
     A BLACK STRETCH LIMOUSINE pulls up. DRAKE BISHOP (50s) emerges
     from the car. He is wearing a dark 4-FIGURE$ suit.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                That's Drake Bishop. owner of the
                Stratosphere Hotel & Casino. He's
                worth a billion dollars. Ten
                million of it recently stolen.

     He is flanked by his ATTORNEY... BURKE BECKETT (50s).

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                His attorney... Burke Beckett.

     Bishop and Becket are greeted by an LVPD DETECTIVE named CARL
     CUDLITZ (40s). A real fat-ass.

                          CUDLITZ
                Mr. Bishop... I'm detective Carl
                Cudlitz.

                          BECKETT
                    (interrupting)
                We know who you are, Cudlitz.

                          BISHOP
                Where's my money?

     Cudlitz hesitates to answer.

                          CUDLITZ
                It would probably be best if you
                took a look at the security tape.

     INT. STRATOSPHERE HOTEL -- SECURITY CORE -- LATER ON

     Bishop and Beckett stand before a bank of SECURITY MONITORS in
     the SECURITY CORE ROOM of the casino.

                          CUDLITZ
                At 5:23 AM you'll see that the
                armored truck pulled into the
                parking lot and turned off its
                engine.

     ON THE MONITOR... the armored truck parks. Four MEN wearing
     MASKS emerge from the front and back. A BLACK VAN backs up to
     face the rear of the truck. The Masked Men quickly unload FOUR
     LARGE DUFFEL BAGS from the armored truck and throw them into the
     back of the van. They jump into the van... and it speeds off.

     (NOTE: How is money transported in an armored vehicle)

     Bishop and Beckett stare at the tape in silent outrage.

                          BISHOP
                    (very soft)
                Rewind, please.

     Beckett turns to one of the SECURITY PERSONNEL.

                          BECKETT
                    (repeating for emphasis)
                REWIND THE TAPE FOR MY CLIENT.

     The TAPE REWINDS... showing the Masked Men emerge from the
     armored truck.

                          BISHOP
                Freeze the tape.

                          BECKETT
                FREEZE THE TAPE.

     The TAPE FREEZES.

                          BISHOP
                Can you zoom in?

                          BECKETT
                ZOOM IN PLEASE.

     Bishop turns to Beckett in outrage.

                          BISHOP
                What are you... a fucking
                mockingbird? Shut the fuck up.

                          BECKETT
                I just...

     Bishop raises a SINGLE GLOVED FINGER in Beckett's direction as
     if to say... NOT ANOTHER FUCKING PEEP. Cudlitz smiles
     nervously... giving the Security Guy a look that says... HURRY
     THE FUCK UP AND DO IT.

     ON THE MONITOR... the image reveals the identity of the MASK.

                          BISHOP
                That's Barbara fucking Bush.

     It is indeed a BARBARA BUSH MASK made of rubber. Cudlitz points
     to another Masked Man behind Bush.

                          CUDLITZ
                I think that's Hillary Clinton.
                Fat ankles.

     INT. CIRCUS CIRCUS CASINO -- HONEYMOON SUITE -- NEXT

     The CAMERA PANS across the HONEYMOON SUITE on the top floor of
     the neighboring Casino. Espinoza and Cosgrove are there with a
     LARGE SURVEILLANCE TEAM. There are several TELEVISION MONITORS
     and lots of RECORDING EQUIPMENT. Cosgrove chews on a DONUT as he
     listens to Bishop's voice on a headset.

                          BISHOP (V.O.)
                There's Nancy Reagan.

                          CUDLITZ (V.O.)
                Jackie Onassis on the left.

                          BISHOP (V.O.)
                It's the goddamn First Ladies.
                Christ almighty.

     INT. STRATOSPHERE HOTEL -- SECURITY CORE -- NEXT

     Bishop stares at the monitors with his arms crossed.

                          CUDLITZ
                We're tracking the license plate
                on the black van.
                    (beat)
                If you don't mind me asking...
                what was in the black duffel
                bags?

     Bishop sighs loudly.

                          BECKETT
                You don't have to answer that.

                          BISHOP
                Shut up, Burke.

     Bishop runs his hands through his hair anxiously.

                          BISHOP (CONT'D)
                Ten million dollars... cash.

     The SECURITY MANAGER enters the SECURITY CORE ROOM.

                          BISHOP (CONT'D)
                Don't tell me this is a fucking
                hijacking... I've used this
                armored truck service for twenty
                years. This is an inside job!
                    (to Beckett)
                What have you gotten me into,
                Burke!

                          SECURITY MANAGER
                Mr. Bishop... you have an urgent
                telephone call.

     Bishop throws the Security Manager a look... then takes the
     WALKIE-TALKIE.

                          BISHOP
                This is Drake Bishop.

                          CLAREMONT (PHONE)
                Mr. Bishop... this is Claremont
                Williams. I own the Williams
                Brothers armored car service.

                          BISHOP
                What happened to my money, Mr.
                Williams?

     INT. CLAREMONT WILLIAMS III BOND AGENCY -- NEXT

     Claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.

                          CLAREMONT
                Yesterday I received an e-mail
                from a source. In this e-mail
                were four social security numbers
                linked to the gentlemen who
                presented counterfeit California
                driver's licenses to my company
                late last night.

     Claremont stares down at copies of FOUR DRIVER'S LICENSES.
     Frances is one of the four.

     INT. STRATOSPHERE HOTEL -- SECURITY CORE -- NEXT

     Bishop snaps his fingers at Beckett.

                          BISHOP
                And?

                          CLAREMONT (PHONE)
                Well... I think that these are
                the gentlemen who robbed us. I'm
                also a bail bondsman out of Los
                Angeles. I can track down and
                deliver these crooks to you...
                for a small finder's fee of
                course.

                          BISHOP
                How much?

                          CLAREMONT (PHONE)
                $300,000.

     Bishop is silent for a moment.

                          BISHOP
                And if you can't deliver them?

                          CLAREMONT (PHONE)
                My theft insurance policy will
                have to fork over the ten
                million... but that will take six
                to eight months due to Nevada
                state law.
                    (beat)
                But you should know sir... that I
                employ bounty hunters. My bounty
                hunters can find these thieves.

     Bishop and Beckett move away from the group to make sure that
     none of the security Team can hear them.

                          BISHOP
                If you deliver these crooks to
                me... you've got yourself a deal.
                $300,000.


     EXT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- LATER THAT MORNING

     The CAMERA MOVES across a SWIMMING POOL in the back of a DESERT
     MANSION. ANTHONY CIGLIUTI (50s) is sitting on the edge of the
     DIVING BOARD... his feet dangling in the water. He has a
     GIGANTIC YELLOW CORDLESS PHONE to his ear.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Crime boss Anthony Cigliuti.
                Bishop's attorney had put his
                boss in business with the mob.

                          CIGLIUTI
                Finder's fee. Sounds like an
                inside job.

                          BECKETT (PHONE)
                Could be. Who knows if this
                Claremont Williams is in on the
                heist or not?

     INT. STRATOSPHERE HOTEL -- CASINO BAR -- NEXT


     Bishop and Beckett sit at the CASINO BAR... sipping Whiskey
     Sours.

                          BECKETT
                All I know... is if this joker
                delivers the First Ladies...
                we'll split the $300,000 fee with
                you.

                          CIGLIUTI (PHONE)
                We have ourselves quite a mess
                here, gentlemen.

     EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- [FLASHBACK] DAWN OF THAT MORNING

     HELICOPTER SHOT: The CAMERA SOARS over the DESERT.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Quite a mess indeed. Beckett had
                just brokered an underhanded deal
                with Cigliuti for a few hundred
                acres of desert land to build a
                golf resort.

     The CAMERA CRESTS a ridge to reveal the ARMORED TRUCK on its way
     east through the desert.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                The ten million en route from LA
                to Vegas belonged to the mob.

                Bishop's clean reputation was a
                great cover for laundered cash.
                If the FBI could link the two men
                together it would be the take
                down of the century.

     INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MORNING

     Cigliuti is now standing on the end of the diving board. His
     phone is now attached to a THICK WIRE that leads to a LARGE
     MOUTHPIECE that wraps around his face.

                          CIGLIUTI
                Here's the plan...

     Cigliuti dives off into pool... PHONE IN HAND.

     INT. UNDERWATER -- NEXT

     Cigliuti swims gracefully along the floor of the pool... still
     talking on the phone.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                The FBI was always listening.
                Hence the underwater cordless.
                Cigliuti had just purchased a
                hundred prototypes from Japan.
                Most of his conversations now
                took place underwater.

     EXT. NEEDLES DMV -- NEXT

     The NEEDLES DMV sits on a shitty side road. There is a MONUMENT
     to comedian SAM KINISON in the parking lot.

                          CIGLIUTI (V.O.)
                We'll have these bounty hunters
                deliver the First Ladies in
                Needles. Sundown at the Sam
                Kinison monument.

     EXT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- SWIMMING POOL -- NEXT


     Cigliuti floats underwater.

                          CIGLIUTI (V.O.)
                Take 'em to Point Silence and
                start cutting off limbs until
                they tell us where the money is.

     EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- NEXT

     A BLACK VAN enters the FENDER COMPOUND. It comes skidding to a
     stop in a cloud of dust.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Locus Fender was brought in to
                drive the armored car.
                Another one of Claremont's
                network of stooges. His mother
                Edna worked at the Needles DMV.

     LOCUS FENDER jumps out from behind the wheel. He still has both
     arms.

                          LOCUS
                MOMMA!


     INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- NEXT

     Edna is passed out in her La-Z-Boy... CIGARETTE dangling in her
     right hand. Showgirls plays on the Mitsubishi widescreen. Chi-
     Chi is asleep in her lap. Locus bursts through the front door
     with one of the DUFFEL BAGS over his shoulder...

                          LOCUS
                Wake up Momma! You're not gonna
                believe this.

     Chi-chi barks as Edna pulls herself out of her slumber.

     EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER

     Edna and Locus emerge from the house.

                          EDNA
                Where are the First Ladies?

                          LOCUS
                They disappeared.

                          TARYN (V.O.)
                What do you mean, they
                disappeared?

     Locus turns back to his mother... trying to explain.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                According to Locus... they
                stopped for gas...

     EXT. TEXACO STATION -- [FLASHBACK] AN HOUR BEFORE


     The Black Van pulls up to a TEXACO STATION outside of Needles.
     Fender parks in front of the gas pumps and turns to look into
     the back of the van. The FIRST LADIES are there. Their masks are
     still on... they fidget anxiously.

                          LOCUS
                I'm gonna fill up the tank and
                grab a cup of coffee. Don't make
                a peep... especially you...
                Barbara.

     INT. TEXACO STATION -- MOMENTS LATER

     Locus is standing at the CHECKOUT LINE in the TEXACO MINI MART.
     He turns and sees a black Chevy pull up next to the van. First
     Ladies jump out... haul off in the Chevy.

     Locus watches these events occur in silent shock. He then
     sprints toward the exit... as the CHEVY TRUCK peels out of the
     parking lot.


     EXT. TEXACO STATION -- NEXT

     Locus rushes toward the van.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                He was sure they'd nabbed the
                cash. Straight up double cross.

     Locus arrives at the back of the van. The doors are still open.
     The DUFFEL BAGS are still there.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                But they left without it.


     INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT

     Taryn taps her pen on the table.

                          TARYN
                That doesn't make any sense.

     EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- NEXT

     Locus opens the back doors to the van to show his mother.

                          LOCUS
                Don't make no goddamn sense.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Either this was some kind of set
                up... or the First Ladies got
                scared... decided to pull out and
                cut their losses.

                          EDNA
                Fuck 'em. Their loss is our gain.
                Put the money in the safe until
                we hear from Claremont.


     EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER THAT MORNING

     The CAMERA APPROACHES the MANSION in Beverly Hills.

                          TARYN (V.O.)
                Where were you when you got the
                call for the job?

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                I was asleep in mum's guest
                house.

     INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT

     Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.

                          DOMINO
                Hello?

                          ED (PHONE)
                We gotta go to work, Domino.


     INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

     Domino scarfs down her breakfast. Sophie paces around the
     kitchen restlessly... peering through the window.

                          SOPHIE
                There is a camera crew waiting
                outside.

     Domino ignores her... paging through the LA TIMES Calendar
     section.

                          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                You will regret this, Domino.

     Domino retrieves her lucky SILVER DOLLAR from the table...
     flipping it through her fingers. sophie grabs her daughters
     chin... forcing eye contact with her.

                          SOPHIE (CONT'D)
                Call it off... and we'll go
                shopping together.

                          DOMINO.
                But I hate shopping, mum. It's
                boring. Why does shopping define
                a woman?

     Sophie sighs.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                I want it to be documented. So
                when I am an old hag I can look
                back at my life and say that I
                once kicked some wicked ass.

     Domino smiles at her mother and kisses her on the forehead...
     offering her a sense of hope.

     EXT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- MOMENTS LATER

     Domino comes strutting down the front walk with her SHOTGUN over
     her shoulder. The LAWN SPRINKLERS cascade behind her...
     refracting the morning light. Ed, Choco and Alf are waiting in
     front of the winnebago with a CAMERAMAN.

                          ED
                Let's go, Domino!

                          DOMINO
                Quit acting macho for the camera,
                douche-bag.

     Domino notices something different about his face.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                Are you wearing make-up?

     Ed shifts around uncomfortably. Choco giggles.

                          ED
                Can you tell?

                          DOMINO
                You're wearing eyeliner. You look
                like a queen.

     Domino notices a SECOND WINNEBAGO parked on the street.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                Who the hell is that?

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                That's the crew. They follow us.


     INT. CREW WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Weiss and Kimmie sit in the CREW WINNEBAGO in front of a bank of
     MONITORS. Both are wearing HEADSETS.

     Weiss looks' to Ian Ziering and Brian Austin Green on one of the
     monitors that is linked to a CAMERA in the CAST WINNEBAGO.

                          WEISS
                    (into headset)
                Okay guys, let's greet the bounty
                hunters.

     ON THE MONITOR... Green is doing PUSH-UPS on the floor of the
     Winnebago. Ziering claps his hands together.

                          ZIERING
                Let's do this.

     EXT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- NEXT

     Green and Ziering emerge from the Cast Winnebago.

                          ZIERING
                Hey guys! I'm Ian Ziering. This
                is Brian Austin Green.

                          DOMINO
                What the fuck is this? We've
                already met you.

     Green eyes Ziering warily.

                          ZIERING
                They need to get the introduction
                on camera. Just play along,
                alright?

                          GREEN
                They're gonna edit it together
                out of sequence so it's more
                exciting.

     EXT. BEVERLY HILLS -- LATER ON


     The CAMERA TRACKS the Winnebagos as they wind through the
     suburban streets of Beverly Hills.

     INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Green talks into the CAMERA with mock enthusiasm.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Claremont fed us a fake story
                about the First Ladies.

                          GREEN
                Today, Domino and her team are
                out to nab four criminals wanted
                for forging checks with
                counterfeit driver's licenses.

     The CAMERA PANS over to Ziering, who sits next to Ed and Domino.

                          ZIERING
                What do we know about these four
                creeps, Domino?

                          DOMINO
                Apparently they call themselves
                the First Ladies.

     INT. HOLLYWOOD RECORDING STUDIO -- NEXT


     LESTER KINCAID (206) is in a RECORDING STUDIO... speaking with
     several other PRODUCERS. He turns to one of the ENGINEERS at the
     mixing board.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Jackie Onassis. His real name was
                Lester Kincaid.

                          LESTER
                Alright... we on the clock. Let's
                get this show on the road.

     A RAP BASE LINE throbs through the studio. Through the GLASS
     PARTITION... LASHANDRA and LASHINDRA stand before the mike. They
     rock back and forth in unison.

                          LASHANDRA
                Gotta strip/ Gotta give some lip/
                Gotta make my tip/ But keep yo
                hands to yourself - Cuz you ain't
                touching these tits.

                          LASHINDRA
                House is a wreck/ Gotta collect
                my check/ Gotta perfume my neck/
                But keep yo hands off the weave cuz
                this black bitch don't suck
                the dick.

                          LASHANDRA/LASHINDRA
                We're Peaches N' Cream and we
                don't take no shit!

     The STUDIO DOOR slams open... Domino and her crew come in...
     GUNS BLAZING... CAMERA CREW in tow.

                          LESTER
                What the fuck is this shit?

     Domino cocks her shotgun and aims it at Lester.

                          DOMINO
                Lester Kincaid... you're going to
                jail.

     INT. CREW WINNEBAGO - NEXT

     Weiss watches the action unfold on the monitor. Choco slams
     Lester up against the wall... exploding his upper lip and
     eyebrow.

                          WEISS
                Jesus. That guy is a psychopath.

     Weiss turns to Kimmie... snapping his fingers in her face.

                          WEISS (CONT'D)
                Clearances. Get me signatures.

     INT. HAWTHORNE COMMUNITY CENTER -- LATER ON

     CARL STEIN (40s) stands on a stage in front of a huge BANNER
     that reads NYMPHOMANIACS ANONYMOUS with several dozen other SEX
     ADDICTS.

                          DOMINO (v.o.)
                Nancy Reagan turned out to be a
                sex-addict named Carl Stein.

                          CARL
                My name is Carl. I am a
                recovering nymphomaniac.

     Carl turns to a BOOM BOX that sits on a wooden stool next to him
     on stage left.

                          CARL (CONT'D)
                Today's topic is... ME SO HORNY.

     Carl presses the PLAY button on the boom box. "ME SO HORNY" by 2
     LIVE CREW blares from it.

                          CARL (CONT'D)
                If 2 Live Crew have taught us
                nothing else... it is that
                horniness in today's society is
                out of control. Sexual saturation
                in all cultural media is at an
                all time high. At some point
                within the next decade, society
                will achieve APATT.

     Carl turns to a MARKER BOARD on stage right. He writes out the
     initials: A. P. A. T. T.

                          CARL (CONT'D)
                All... Porno... All the time.
                Porn addiction in this country
                will become an epidemic.
                Phase one... masturbation.
                We must not revert to
                masturbatory habits that are
                filth and danger oriented.

     A CAMERA OPERATOR enters the community center... quietly
     preparing to capture the moment.

                          CARL (CONT'D)
                To our male friends here today.
                We must remove the vacuum
                cleaners from our homes. We must
                turn off our jacuzzi jets.
                To our female friends... we must
                stop abusing our dogs with the
                lure of a peanut butter snatch.

     Domino and her crew enter the LOBBY of the Community Center.

                          CARL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                We must channel our horniness
                into extracurricular activities
                such as fantasy football,
                Taekwondo and needle-point.

     Domino bursts through the doors dramatically.

                          DOMINO
                CARL STEIN.

     The crowd stirs in their seats, turning to face Domino. Carl
     rises slowly to his feet with a look of anguish on his chubby
     face.

                          CARL
                Yes?

     Ed and Choco round the side aisles blocking all exits from the
     building. Choco looks like he's gonna commit genocide.

                          ED
                Cool it, Choco.

                          DOMINO
                YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

     Choco pounces on Carl... knocking him to the ground. He screams
     out in pain.

     The Sex Addicts leer at Domino. Male and Female.


     INT. CREW WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Weiss turns from the monitors... cringing.

                          WEISS
                Kimmie, who is this chump?

     Kimmie is on the phone... scrawling notes frantically.

                          KIMMIE
                Carl Stein. He's an entertainment
                lawyer. Some shit firm.

     EXT. KAPPA EPSILON GAMMA -- SUNSET

     A FRAT HOUSE sits on FRATERNITY ROW at CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Barbara Bush and Hillary Clinton
                were next. We found them at their
                Frat House.

     INT. KEG HOUSE -- NEXT


     Frances and his cousin CHUCKIE (24) are chalking up lines of
     COCAINE on a GLASS TABLE in the fraternity house. STACIE STEVENS
     (20) and ARIANA BOWER (21) are sitting across from them.

                          STACIE
                I've never snorted ritalin
                before.

                          CHUCKIE
                This is coke on the right.
                Ritalin is on the left. Snort one
                line in each nostril.

                          FRANCES
                In Vegas we call it Peaches and
                Cream. It's a killer high.

                          ARIANA
                I love Vegas.

     EXT. KAPPA EPSILON GAMMA -- NEXT

     There is a FLORIST VAN parked across the street from the KEG
     HOUSE.

     INT. FLORIST VAN -- NEXT

     Two FBI AGENTS are sitting inside the van. A bunch of SOUND
     RECORDING equipment sits in front of them. The sound of Stacie
     Stevens snorting cocaine and ritalin can be heard echoing
     throughout the van.

                          CHUCKIE (V. O. )
                Yeah. That's Peaches and Cream,
                babe.

     FBI AGENT #1 looks through the back window of the van. The
     Winnebagos are approaching from the south end of FRATERNITY ROW.

                          FBI AGENT #1
                Alright boys... we are in
                business. The bounty hunters have
                arrived. They are driving...
                winnebagos.

     The Agent has BINOCULARS aligned on Alf's face through the
     windshield of the cast winnebago.

     INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Carl and Lester are handcuffed... sitting next to each other on
     the couch. Domino is feeding the new additions... 4 GOLDFISH in
     a BOWL sitting in the kitchenette.

                          CARL
                Get that fucking camera out of my
                face!

                          DOMINO
                You're just making yourself look
                like a bigger loser by yelling.

     Carl notices Ziering and Green.

                          CARL
                Wait a minute... are you...
                You're those fucking assholes
                from 90210!

                          GREEN
                We're hosting a new show now.
                It's called Bounty Hunters.

                          CARL
                Fuck you.

                          ZIERING
                This show is gonna be our big
                comeback. You just wait and see.

                          CARL
                Right! You're about a week away
                from hosting an infomercial.

     Ziering grits his teeth... trying to quell his rage.

                          ZIERING
                Listen, dick-fuck. I had a good
                run while it lasted. Now I've got
                ten million in the bank. I'll
                never have to work again for the
                rest of my life.

                          GREEN
                And he used to fuck a Playboy
                centerfold every night.

                          ZIERING
                Twice a night, sometimes.

     Green and Ziering high five.

     INT. CREW WINNEBAGO/INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Weiss is watching this encounter on the monitors with manic
     intensity. ON THE MONITOR: The Bounty Hunters say GRACE
     together. ALF speaks in ARABIC. They then break and start to
     devour their sub sandwiches.

                          WEISS
                This is... fascinating. I... for
                one... just can't stop watching.

     Kimmie nods her head in agreement.

                          KIMMIE
                This could break new ground in
                terms of traditional host models.
                It's self-reflexive reality
                television.

                          WEISS
                Your theory is valid... in
                theory.

                          KIMMIE
                We can't lose focus of Domino's
                journey, Mark.

     Kimmie speaks into the microphone on her headset.

                          KIMMIE (CONT'D)
                Domino, we're going to send
                Ziering and Green in with you on
                this next raid.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Fine. As long as they stay out of
                our way.

                          WEISS
                    (to Kimmie)
                We're covered on legal with that,
                right?

                          KIMMIE
                In theory.

     Weiss speaks into his headset.

                          WEISS
                Guys... the last two raids...
                they were a bit too psychotic for
                my insurance carrier's taste. I
                think he just had a bowel
                movement in his pants. Could you
                maybe ratchetdown the violence
                just a tad this time? Especially
                you, Coco.

                          CHOCO
                    (on monitor)
                It's Choco.

                          WEISS
                We want non-violent action.
                Bounty hunter life in the

                          KIMMIE
                Fast and or furious.

                          WEISS
                But real. This is gritty. Like
                Cassavetes.

                          KIMMIE
                Exactly. Why don't you leave the
                guns behind this time? Go in with
                only batons, brass knuckles, and
                numb-chucks.

     ON THE MONITOR: Domino and Ed stare at each other.

                          DOMINO
                    (on the monitor)
                It's a fucking frat house. Why

     INT. FLORIST VAN -- NEXT

     FBI AGENT #2 watches Domino and her crew exit the Winnebago with

                Okay... they have a camera man
                with them for some reason.

     EXT. KEG HOUSE -- NEXT

     Domino and her crew approach the entrance to the Keg house.

     INT. KEG HOUSE -- NEXT


     The CAMERA TRACKS along with Domino as she works her way through
     the corridors of the Keg house... Choco and Ed flanking her on
     either side. KEG BROTHERS emerge from their rooms... staring at
     her in awe.

                          DOMINO
                    (to Choco)
                Take it easy. There's no need to
                get too rough with these kids.

     EXT. KEG HOUSE -- BACK LOT -- NEXT

     Domino and her crew emerge into the BACK LOT of the Keg house.
     Several dozen COLLEGE STUDENTS are surrounding a KEG that has
     been placed near the edge of the SAND VOLLEYBALL COURT.

                          DOMINO
                We're looking for Frances and

     The students eye Choco.

                No shit? How does that work?

                          DOMINO
                Well... if we catch the right guy
                we get to keep 10% of is bail and
                he gets to go to jail.

                          KEG BROTHER
                Whoa. Cool.

     INT. CREW WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Kimmie turns to Weiss.

                          KIMMIE
                This girl is going to be a star.
                She just tells it like it is.

                          WEISS
                We should sign her to a talent
                holding deal.

     INT. KEG HOUSE -- FRANCES' ROOM -- NEXT


     Stacie and Ariana are dancing on the table in FRANCES' ROOM.
     Their hips gyrate to the smooth Mary J. Blige beat. Frances and
     Chuckie sit on the couch... fidgeting from the drugs. A bunch of
     Keg Brothers enter with Domino and her crew. ('Real People
     Casting')

                          DOMINO
                Frances... where is Frances?

     The Keg Brothers cheer in anticipation. Frances and Chuckie look
     at one another in shock.

     INT. CIRCUS CIRCUS -- HONEYMOON SUITE -- NEXT

     Cosgrove and Espinoza are huddled around Zendejas... listening
     to the audio feed.

     INT. KEG HOUSE -- FRANCES' ROOM -- LATER ON

     Domino approaches Frances and Chuckie... flanked on either side
     by her "BODYGUARDS" Choco and Ed.

                          DOMINO
                Who wants to be on Bounty
                Hunters? You can all be famous if
                you cooperate!

     Ed pushes several of the Keg brothers back.

                          ED
                Everyone... please give Domino
                her space. Step back, please!

                          DOMINO
                You have sixty seconds... here's
                the question...
                    (dramatic pause)
                Which one of you is Frances?

     Frances and Chuckie glance at one another nervously. The crowd
     goes wild. Frances locks eyes with Domino. He knows something is
     awry. Domino retrieves two pairs of HANDCUFFS and twirls them
     around either finger.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                Cuff 'em boys.

     The crowd goes ballistic as Domino hands the CUFFS to Choco and
     Ed. Just as they move toward the couch... Frances stands up and
     FLIPS THE GLASS TABLE OVER. He then CLOCKS Ed in the face with a
     RIGHT HOOK. Chuckie bolts for the exit.

     Choco chases after Chuckie. Mayhem in the Keg house. The CAMERA
     MAN catches all of it. Ed tries to restrain Frances... but
     several Keg Brothers jump him. Domino goes to intervene... but
     STACIE jumps on her back.

                          STACIE
                FUCK YOU BITCH!

     Domino shakes Stacie off. She lunges back at Domino again...
     Domino CLOCKS HER IN THE FACE. stacie falls back onto the floor.

     Ed CLOBBERS two Keg Brothers in the face with his BATON... just
     as Domino catches up with Frances as he tries to escape the
     crowded room.

     Frances slams Domino against the wall... and she responds by
     wrapping the CHAIN of her NUMB-CHUCKS around his neck.

     She twists the handles... and Frances lets out a CHOKING
     sound... grasping at the chain with his fingertips.

     Ed approaches from behind and handcuffs Frances.

                          DOMINO
                You're under arrest.

     INT. KEG HOUSE -- BACK LOT -- NEXT

     The Camera Man follows Choco into the back lot.

     ACROSS THE LOT... Chuckie is behind the wheel of his SILVER
     BMW... starting the engine. He puts the BMW in drive and floors
     it out of the parking lot toward the REAR DRIVEWAY.

     As he rounds the corner... Choco is on a balcony with a huge
     television OVER HIS HEAD. Chuckle slams on the breaks.

                          CHUCKIE
                Fuck.

     Choco HURLS THE TELEVISION AND IT PLUNGES THROUGH THE
     WINDSHIELD INTO THE FRONT SEAT OF THE CAR.

     Choco jumps fifteen feet off the balcony onto the hood of the
     BMW, lifts Chuckie out of the driver's seat and launches him
     like a two pound bag of sugar.

                          CHOCO
                AAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

     Chuckie travels a good twenty feet and lands on his head.

     Lashindra and Raoul.

                          LATEESHA
                This new wrinkle in the plan. It
                was one of those last minute
                decision-type decisions.

                          LASHANDRA
                Those are the worst kind.

     Lateesha swallows every last ounce of pride she once had.

                          LATEESHA
                Lateesha has dug herself a deep
                hole... and she can't get out by
                herself. Can you dig?

                          RAOUL
                We're in that hole with you,
                Teesha. We dig together. We're a
                team.

     Raoul and Lateesha join hands in the center of the table.
     Raoul's NAILS are painted semi-turbo.

                          LASHANDRA
                Just like Billy Ocean says.
                When the going gets tough...

                          LASHINDRA
                The tough get going.

     Lashandra and Lashindra put their hands in with Lateesha and
     Raoul. The FOURSOME IS UNITED.

     The Winnebagos are fueling up at the same complex. There are
     dozens of cars waiting under the fluorescent lights. Domino and
     her crew emerge from the Crew Winnebago. Weiss and Kimmie are
     following close behind.

     Alf is pumping gas. He looks over at a WHITE TRASH FAMILY
     gawking at the MURAL on the side of the RV. The MOM begins to
     SNAP PHOTOGRAPHS of him. Alf waves to the camera.

                          ALF

                Why the hell are we delivering
                them out here? I can't even find
                any warrants in the system for
                these four.

     INT. AM/PM COMPLEX -- MOMENTS LATER

     Domino arrives in line at the KFC counter in a huff. Choco and
     Green are waiting in line. Green smiles at Domino... studying
     her.

                          GREEN
                It's all just an act... isn't it.

                          DOMINO
                What?

                          GREEN
                This tough girl thing.

                          DOMINO
                What makes you so sure?

                          GREEN
                Because I'm an actor.
                    (beat)
                You can't fake it like we can.
                You're just a scared little girl
                with some serious daddy issues.

     Domino glares at him... punches him in the face. She storms off.
     Choco laughs to himself.

     EXT. AM/PM COMPLEX -- TARMAC -- MOMENTS LATER

     Domino walks across the TARMAC toward the winnebagos. Ziering is

                My friend Tina thought you were

                          ZIERING
                Oh really?

     He hands her the autograph.

                          ZIERING (CONT'D)

                Where are the bond certificates
                for the First Ladies?

                          ED
                There are no bond certificates.

                          DOMINO
                What do you mean? Claremont
                didn't provide them?

                          ED
                No. What's the big deal?

                          DOMINO
                Something is going down.
                Something bad.

                          ED
                Claremont said we deliver the
                First Ladies in Needles. Then we
                go home. No questions asked.

     Domino thinks to herself for a moment.

                          DOMINO
                You know why there aren't bond
                certificates? Because these guys
                have never been arrested. This is
                a private job. I'm telling you
                that Lateesha and Claremont are
                setting us up.

     EXT. NEEDLES DMV -- NEXT

     The WINNEBAGOS pull into the NEEDLES TOWN HALL parking lot.

     Carl fidgets anxiously on the couch.

                          CARL
                What happens now?

                          ED
                Now we turn you over to the
                authorities.

     Frances glances over at Chuckie... shaking his head slowly.

                          CHUCKlE
                You drove us all the way out to
                fucking Needles to put us in
                jail?

                          FRANCES
                This is fucked up. I don't like
                this. We gotta call my dad.

     Domino and Ed begin to escort the First Ladies out of the
     Winnebago.

                          DOMINO
                Turn off the camera.


     INT. CREW WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Weiss and Kimmie watch from the monitors. Ziering and Green are

                Don't listen to her. Keep
                filming.

     Green is pacing around in the back of the Winnebago with his
     cell phone to his ear.

                          GREEN
                I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS SHIT!!
                JUST GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE BY A
                GIRL! ON CAMERA!

     Green has two black eyes... congealed blood dripping from his
     nose.

     INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Choco RIPS the camera away from the Camera Man... who steps back
     in fear. He then hurls it out the door onto the tarmac. An 18
     WHEELER TRUCK drives by and decimates it.

                          CAMERA MAN
                Please... don't hurt me.

                          CHOCO
                When Domino speaks... you listen.

     Domino turns to Ed.

                          DOMINO
                This whole situation is fucked. I
                sure as hell hope you know what
                you're doing.

     Ed turns away... ignoring her.

     Domino notices the fish tank. The FISH is floating DEAD on the
     surface of the water. She retrieves her SILVER DOLLAR from her
     pocket... flipping it through her fingers.


     EXT. NEEDLES DMV -- NEXT

     Ed and Choco escort the First Ladies toward the Suburbans. Two
     of BISHOP'S GOONS emerge from inside.

                          CARL
                What is this shit? These aren't

                          ED
                Shut the fuck up.

     Frances looks terrified.

                          FRANCES
                Shit. This is bad. This is really
                bad, Chuckie.

                Watch your mouth. God is
                listening. We need him now.

     They arrive at the first SUV. The Goons look at one another.

                          ED
                Here's your First Ladies.

     The Goons shove the First Ladies into the two SUVs.

                          GOON #2
                It's been a pleasure doing

     INT. BONNIE SPRINGS MOTEL -- LOUNGE -- NEXT

     The entire BOUNTY HUNTERS GANG is assembled in the LOUNGE...
     sipping on cocktails. Weiss is deep in conversation with Ziering
     and Green. Some FAT REDNECK WOMAN is singing KARAOKE.

                          WEISS
                I'm telling you guys... the

                phenomenal. This is going to jump
                start your careers.

     Ziering claps his hands together.

                          ZIERING
                Fuck yeah. Told you it was worth
                it.

     Green smiles with a sense of cautious optimism.

                          ZIERING (CONT'D)
                Come on, B.A. Think positive for
                once. Let's go out and celebrate.
                Where's the nearest strip club?

     Kimmie looks around. Choco is meandering around.

                          KIMMIE
                Where is Domino?

                          WEISS
                She went up to her room.

     Choco notices a vase of SILK FLOWERS on a side table. He grabs
     one.


     INT. MOTEL ROOM -- BATHROOM -- NEXT

     Domino sits on the floor of the bathroom... freshly showered.
     The GOLDFISH floats on the surface of the toilet water. She
     then flushes the toilet... as the dead goldfish disappears down
     into the vortex... into the ABYSS OF SHIT.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Something awful was about to
                happen. I could feel it in my
                bones.

     A TEAR traces her cheek. Just then... there is a KNOCK at her
     door.

     EXT. MOTEL ROOM -- NEXT

     Choco stands at her door. He holds the linen flower. As he
     fidgets in front of her door, he chickens out... throws the
     flower behind a towel cart.

     Domino opens the door, tears still in her eyes.

                          DOMINO
                What is it, Choco?

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                Are you all right?

     Nothing from Domino.

                          CHOCO (SPANISH) (CONT'D)
                Did somebody hurt you? Tell me,
                I'll fucking kill him.

     Domino sighs.

                          DOMINO
                Mind if I ask you a question?
                    (Choco nods)
                Do I look like I speak Spanish?
                Do I look Mexican to you?
                ENGLISH! SPEAK IN ENGLISH!

     She steps into the hallway.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                ED IS RIGHT, IT'S NOT CUTE! IT'S
                NEVER BEEN CUTE. I DON'T
                UNDERSTAND YOU!

     Choco retreats down the hall.

     INT. CHOCO'S MOTEL ROOM -- NEXT

     Choco returns to his room, devastated by Domino's tirade. PORN
     BLARES on the TV. Ed sits on the bed with a BUDWEISER in hand...
     COCAINE on his upper lip.

                          ED
                They never show penetration in
                these piece of shit hotels.

     Choco picks up a chair and throws it at the TV, putting an end
     to a dedicated group copulation.

                          ED (CONT'D)
                I just charged $12.95 to our room
                for that movie. Now I'll never
                know how the story ends.

                          CHOCO
                Don't fuck with me, Ed. Not you,
                not tonight.

     Ed walks over to the mirror and fixes his hair.

                          ED
                Very well. If you need me, I'll
                be in Domino's room... making up
                my own ending.

     That was it. The STRAW... the CAMEL... the BROKEN BACK.

     Choco LUNGES at Ed and throws him to the ground. PUNCHES...
     KICKS... you name it... they're doing it.

                          ED (CONT'D)
                C'mon, boy. I'm gonna whup you
                and then I'm gonna walk over
                there and whup your girlfriend.

     Choco CLOCKS Ed in the face. Ed falls to the ground. Choco grabs
     a CHAIR, moves to strike, but Ed thwarts him by pulling his GUN.

     They stare at one another.

                          ED (CONT'D)
                Put that fucking chair down and
                don't say a word, Spanish or
                otherwise.

     Choco slowly lowers the chair to the ground. Ed gets up, sits on
     it. Choco tries to talk but Ed checks him with his gun.

                          ED (CONT'D)
                Young, dumb, full of cum. Don't
                you get it, boy? I got no designs
                on Domino, she's like a daughter
                to me. And you're like a son.
                    (massages his jaw)
                I've been in this business for as
                long as I can remember and I
                don't know anybody who can bust
                down a door as well as you. And
                we're talking the top half.
                    (beat)
                Yet when it comes to her, I've
                never seen such a pussy. You'd
                just as well stick a shotgun
                barrel to your head than ask her
                out. So when are you going to do
                something about it?

     Choco just sits there on the bed. He knows that Ed's dead on.

                          ED (CONT'D)
                Oh! And another thing. I am a
                liar. A pathological liar. There
                was no day in Danang, no multiple
                tours in Nam. Just lies to get
                laid, lies to get respect.
                    (beat)
                Truth is... I'm scared shitless
                all the time.

                          CHOCO
                What about your toe?

                          ED
                    (points his gun at his foot)
                Anything to get the fuck out of
                dodge.

                          CHOCO
                Did it hurt?

                          ED
                    (beat)
                What do you think, dumbshit?

     Choco laughs.

                          ED (CONT'D)
                Shat my pants.

     They laugh, together.

     INT. MOTEL ROOM -- NEXT


     Domino sits on the bed with a LAPTOP in front of her. She has
     pulled up copies of the FOUR DRIVER'S LICENSES on the screen.

     The CAMERA moves in toward FRANCES' FACE on the computer screen.

                          DOMINO
                Who are you?

     INT. FBI JET -- NEXT

     The CAMERA MOVES down the aisle of an FBI JET. Taryn, Cosgrove
     and Espinoza are sitting across from Zendejas. They are all
     three staring at a MONITOR. On it is an INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGE
     looking down at the desert landscape. Taryn leans in for a
     closer look.

                          COSGROVE
                Can you zoom in?

     Zendejas types something on the keyboard and the IMAGE ZOOMS IN
     closer to reveal TWO CHEVY SUBURBANS driving north through the
     desert.

                          ESPINOZA
                Where are they taking these kids?

     The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH THE INFRARED MONITOR...

     EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT

     ...and DROPS DOWN above the CHEVY SUBURBANS as they move through
     the night. The HEADLIGHTS refract through the dust spinning from
     the tires.


     INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN #1 -- NEXT

     Frances and Chuckie sit in the back of SUBURBAN #1. Chuckie
     shakes his head slowly.

                          CHUCKIE
                I never should have listened to
                you, Frances. You went too far
                this time.

     INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN #2 -- NEXT

     Lester and Carl sit in the back of SUBURBAN #2.

                          LESTER

                Our Father... who art in Heaven.
                Hallowed be thy name.

     INT. MOTEL ROOM -- NEXT


     Domino stares at the laptop. She looks very distraught. She has
     discovered something.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be
                done. On Earth as it is in
                Heaven.

     EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT

     Frances, Chuckie, Lester and Carl are lined up next to one
     another. GOON #2 has an AK-47 aimed at them. GOON #1 has his
     phone to his ear.

                          GOON #1
                Sir... would you like us to shoot
                them in the kneecaps?


     INT. CIRCUS CIRCUS -- CASINO OFFICE -- NEXT

     Bishop stares out at the Vegas strip.

                          BISHOP
                Ask them politely where the money
                is. If they don't know... tell
                them to start digging their own
                graves. It's that simple.

     EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT

     GOON #1 hangs up the phone and raises his own AK-47. He turns
     the safety off.

     INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT


     Anthony Cigliuti is asleep in his bed when the PHONE begins to
     ring. He reaches over and answers it.

                Hello?

                          KEG PRESIDENT (PHONE)
                Mr. Cigliuti?

                          CIGLIUTI
                Yes.

                          KEG PRESIDENT (PHONE)
                I'm calling from the Kappa
                Epsilon Gamma house at California
                University.

                          CIGLIUTI
                Yes.

     INT. KEG HOUSE -- CHAPTER ROOM -- NEXT


     The KEG PRESIDENT is sitting at the head of the CHAPTER ROOM
     with a phone to his ear. The rest of the fraternity watches in
     silent dread.

                          KEG PRESIDENT
                I'm so sorry to be bothering you
                in the middle of the night like
                this... but it's a bit of an
                emergency.

                          CIGLIUTI (PHONE)
                What is it?

                          KEG PRESIDENT
                Your son... and your nephew have
                been kidnapped by these crazy
                game show hosts from the Fox

     INT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NEXT

     Cigliuti sits up in bed.

                My Frances? Frances and Charles
                have been kidnapped?

     EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT


     The GOONS have their AK-47s aimed and ready to fire. Frances
     and the others are standing in front of their own graves in the
     desert sand.

                          GOON #1
                For the last time... where is our
                fucking money?

     Frances and Chuckie are hyperventilating.

                          FRANCES
                We don't know anything about any
                money. Me and Chuckie just wanted
                fake IDs!

                          CHUCKlE
                We won't tell anyone about the
                DMV scam! We promise!

     Carl falls to his knees.

                          CARL
                    (crying)
                Please... I just supply them with
                pussy...

     A TEAR rolls down Lester's cheek.

                          LESTER
                    (whisper)
                I just wanted to get people high.

     The GOONS look at one another and roll their eyes. Death seems
     imminent.

                Forgive us oh Lord for our daily
                trespasses... for we know not
                what we do.

     The COIN floats to the APEX of its ark. The GOONS fire their
     weapons... unloading a hail of bullets into the four men.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                And what we see... may not be the
                truth.

     EXT. TEXACO STATION -- [FLASHBACK] EARLY THAT MORNING

     Locus Fender is behind the wheel of the BLACK VAN at the TEXACO
     STATION. He turns to look into the back of the van.

     The FIRST LADIES are there. Their masks are still on.

                          LOCUS
                I'm gonna fill up the tank and
                grab a cup of coffee.
                Don't make a peep... especially
                you... Barbara.

     Locus exits the van. BARBARA BUSH rips off his mask. It is
     RAOUL.

                          RAOUL
                Now what?

     The rest of the masks come off. LATEESHA... LASHINDRA...
     LASHANDRA... and RAOUL... are the FIRST LADIES.

                          LATEESHA
                I don't know!

     Lateesha's CELL PHONE begins to ring.

                          LATEESHA (CONT'D)
                Where are you?

     INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN -- NEXT

     Claremont is behind the Wheel of a BLACK CHEVY SUBURBAN. He
     pulls into the Texaco parking lot.

                          CLAREMONT
                I'm pulling up right now.
                Evacuate the fucking van! Plans
                have changed!

     EXT. TEXACO STATION -- NEXT


     The FIRST LADIES emerge from the back of the van and jumps into
     the black Chevy. Claremont slams on the gas... peeling out of
     the parking lot.

                          CLAREMONT
                You motherfuckin' Tino. You
                fucked us so bad.

                          LATEESHA
                I fucked up. You can't help your
                greedy black lying ass from
                trying to get everything. All
                you've done is put a death
                sentence on Meeka.

     Claremont puts the phone up to his ear.

     INT. MOTEL ROOM -- [FLASH FORWARD] NEXT

     Ed and Choco are sitting on separate beds... staring at the

     Ed turns to face him.

                Promise me... you won't ever tell
                Domino.

                          CHOCO
                What?

     Domino paces around the room anxiously... phone rings.

                          CLAREMONT (PHONE)
                The FBI was breathing down
                Lateesha's neck... and she
                assumed that they were onto our
                scam. So she set up some college
                kids to take the fall for the
                heist. They have been under FBI
                surveillance for the past 6
                months.

                          CLAREMONT
                I don't know. They might be dead
                already.

                There's something else you should
                know, Domino. Those college
                kids... were mafia kids.
                Cigliuti's kids.

                          DOMINO
                Jesus Christ! Anthony Cigliuti?!
                You set me up to deliver the
                children of a mafia crime boss to
                be executed? Do you know how

     Domino emerges into the CORRIDOR with her BACKPACK in tow. She
     moves swiftly toward the elevators.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Claremont laid it all out on the
                table. His plan was to ask for a
                $300,000 finders fee to recover
                the ten million he'd stolen. The
                whole thing became a huge cluster
                fuck when Lateesha tried to pin
                it on the Cigliuti kids.

     INT. BONNIE SPRINGS MOTEL -- LOUNGE -- NEXT

     Weiss is singing KARAOKE with Kimmie in the lounge. The song is

                Now our only chance for survival
                was to stay on course and
                retrieve the money.
                    (beat)
                First priority was cut loose the

                evidence behind.

     Domino approaches... grabbing Alf by the arm.

     Domino and her crew rush toward the Winnebagos.

     Alf moves toward the Crew Winnebago.

     INT. CREW WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Alf KICKS DOWN THE DOOR into the Crew Winnebago.

     He looks around frantically for the TAPES. There are BOXES
     everywhere. He begins to tear through them... MAKE-UP... CRAFT
     SERVICE... SCRIPTS... NO TAPES.


     INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Domino, Choco and Ed burst into the Cast Winnebago.

                          DOMINO
                We have to find a man named Locus
                Fender. He knows where the money
                is hidden. If we return Bishop's
                money we might be in the clear.

     INT. CREW WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Alf is tearing the Winnebago apart. He arrives at one BOX... it
     is filled with a DOZEN TAPES. TOO MANY TO CARRY.
     He hears HONKING outside.

                          ALF
                Shit.

     Alf rifles through his back and pulls out an AMATEUR BOMB that
     he has made. He LIGHTS the fuse and drops it onto the carpet of
     the winnebago.

     Alf comes into the Cast Winnebago empty-handed.

                          DOMINO
                BOOM? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

     Alf steps on the gas.

     EXT. BONNIE SPRINGS MOTEL -- NEXT

     The Cast Winnebago peels out of the parking lot. Just then...
     THE CREW WINNEBAGO EXPLODES.

     INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT


     Taryn stares at Domino.

                          TARYN
                We know that the Afghani burned
                the Winnebago because of the
                tapes.
                    (beat)
                But there were duplicate tapes in
                Mr. Weiss's room. We know
                everything, Domino. Come clean
                now... and you can save yourself
                from going to jail.

     Domino takes a pull from her Marlboro.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                The bitch was bluffing. There
                were no dupe tapes. If there
                were... they'd have shown them to
                me by now.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                Show me the tapes. I want to see
                them.

                          TARYN
                Not yet.

     INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.

                          DOMINO
                Take us to Vegas.


     EXT. BONNIE SPRINGS MOTEL -- LATER ON

     The HOTEL is being evacuated. POLICE OFFICERS and FIREMEN move
     onlookers away from the fire. Weiss watches in horror with
     Kimmie at his side.

     EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP -- NIGHT

     HELICOPTER SHOT: The CAMERA sweeps across the VEGAS STRIP.

                          CLAREMONT (V.O.)
                If Locus Fender has money in his
                pocket... you'll find him at
                Olympic Gardens.

     INT. OLYMPIC GARDENS -- NEXT


     The CAMERA TRACKS through a large strip club called OLYMPIC
     GARDENS... arriving at Locus Fender as he sits next to the
     STAGE. He is HAMMERED... dropping $100 BILLS like they were
     singles. A STRIPPER approaches him. It is Lashandra.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Lashandra and Lashindra were one
                step ahead of us... orchestrating
                Claremont's plan.

                          LASHANDRA
                Would you like a lapdance?
                Tonight we have a two for one
                deal for these luscious tits.

     Locus smiles up at her.

     INT. OLYMPIC GARDENS -- PRIVATE ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

     Lashandra leads Locus into the private LAPDANCE ROOM. Domino and
     her crew are waiting there. Choco grabs him and slams him
     against the wall. Domino slaps on the handcuffs.

     INT. OLYMPIC GARDENS -- NEXT


     Domino and Ed follow Choco and Locus through the club. She
     notices Ziering and Green sitting at the BAR. Ed grabs Domino by
     the arm and points over at them.

                          ED
                We need hostages. Celebrity
                hostages. Just in case this gets
                ugly.

     EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON

     The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.

                          CLAREMONT (PHONE)
                The combination code is tattooed
                on his right arm. You'll never
                get inside Edna Fender's safe
                without the code-breaker on that
                arm.

     INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Domino rides shotgun with her CELL PHONE to her ear.

                          DOMINO
                You're breaking up... I can't
                hear you.

                          CLAREMONT (PHONE)
                Remove... (STATIC)... the...
                right arm.

                          DOMINO
                What!!?

     The phone disconnects. Ed leans in from the back.

                          ED
                What did he say about the arm?

                          DOMINO
                He said... take his right arm.

     Ed looks over at Choco with an expression that says... DO IT.
     Choco nods his head... then moves toward the back area with his
     SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN and disappears behind the curtain.

     INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- BACK BED AREA -- NEXT

     In the BACK BED AREA... Locus is sitting next to Ziering and
     Green... who are both HANDCUFFED watching 'SPUN' on TV. Locus
     has DUCT TAPE over his mouth. Choco pushes LOCUS up against the
     wall with his foot... cocking the SHOTGUN.

                          ZIERING
                What the fuck is this?

     Choco raises his shotgun and places it against Locus's shoulder.

                          LOCUS
                PLEASE! NO!

     Choco pulls the trigger. BLOOD EXPLODES ACROSS THE WALL... ALL
     OVER ZIERING AND GREEN.

                          GREEN
                OH FUCK! HOLY FUCK!

     Choco fires off another round.

                          ZIERING
                OH MY FUCKING GOD!!!!!!

     HE THEN RETRIEVES THE ARM... NOW SEVERED FROM LOCUS' BODY.

     Choco throws a roll of DUCT TAPE to Ziering... unlocking his
     handcuffs.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                Cauterize the wound.

     EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- NEXT

     The Winnebago drives out toward the FENDER COMPOUND. SMOKE
     BILLOWS from the METAL BARRELS in the distance.


     INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- NEXT

     The DOOR is KICKED DOWN... Ed and Choco step through... followed
     by Domino.

                          TARYN (V.O.)
                So now... we're back to where we
                started.

     Domino walks through the family room. The Manchurian Candidate
     can be heard playing on the Mitsubishi widescreen. She notices
     the LA-Z-BOY in the corner of the room. It is gently rocking
     back and forth.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Yes... we sure are.

     A low growling noise can be heard from the kitchen.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                EDNA! WE KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE!

     INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- SAFE ROOM -- NEXT

     The DOOR to the SAFE ROOM opens. The TWO DUFFEL BAGS are sitting
     on the cement floor.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                We found the money in the safe.
                It was all there.

     Domino stares at them for a silent moment.


     INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- FAMILY ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

     Domino and Choco arrive with the duffel bags.

                          DOMINO
                Let's roll.

     Ed turns to Edna.

                          ED
                Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.
                    (back to Domino)
                It's gonna be a long night.

     EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER

     Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as
     they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is
     sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Turned out Edna. had one last
                trick up her sleeve.

     INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- KITCHEN -- [FLASHBACK] TEN MINUTES AGO


     Edna is in the kitchen... pouring coffee grounds into the COFFEE
     MAKER. She casually retrieves a small CONTAINER OF POWDER from a
     DRAWER and drops several spoonfuls into the coffee grounds.

                          EDNA
                Cock-fuckers are gonna pay.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Mescaline.

     INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NIGHT

     Domino and the others are all drinking coffee. Alf stares out
     through the windshield at the GLOW of Vegas in the distance.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                With each passing second...
                reality eclipsed into the asphalt
                horizon. Soon the mescaline was
                pulsing through our veins.

     Alf slowly lowers his foot onto the ACCELERATOR. The Winnebago
     is now going 80 MPH. Alf is SWEATING PROFUSELY.

     In the back... Choco stares at Domino with PSYCHOTIC LOVE.

                          CHOCO (IN SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
                You are the Angel of fire. You
                burn the brightest.
                    (beat)
                I want to fuck you in the ass.

     Ed is FLEXING his hands back and forth.

                          ED
                Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
                    (beat)
                I GOT FUCKING VISUALS HERE!

     Domino begins to figure it out.

                          DOMINO
                The bitch dosed the coffee.

     IN THE FRONT... Alf is now doing 100 MPH. The entire Winnebago
     has begun to shake.

     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD... the HIGHWAY begins to twist and turn
     like a CARTOON CEMENT RACETRACK imbedded into ROCK FACE WALLS OF
     SAND.

     ALF steers the Winnebago to follow the ROAD TO ARMAGEDDON
     unfolding in his brain. Standing in the middle of the road is
     ALF... the SITCOM ALIEN. He is pumped up like STALLONE...
     holding a FUTURISTIC MACHINE GUN.

                          ALF
                HOLD ON! WE GO FOR A RIDE!

     EXT. HIGHWAY -- NEXT

     The Winnebago SWERVES off the highway into the desert...
     CAREENING BACK AND FORTH.

     INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Domino and the others are thrown violently across the Winnebago.

                          DOMINO
                ALF! STOP THE CAR!

                          ALF
                    (Arabic)
                SHEKARALLAH!! MALAAKAALLAAHHHH!!


     EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT

     THE WINNEBAGO TURNS VIOLENTLY TO THE LEFT... TEARING THROUGH
     DESERT SAND AND PLANTS... FLIPPING OVER AT MORE THAN 100MPH.

     INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT

     Domino... Choco... Ed... Ziering... Green... TUMBLE THROUGHOUT
     THE CAB... SMASHING INTO EVERYTHING. A TORNADO OF DESTRUCTION.

     GOLDFISH TWIST IN THE AIR... GLASS SHATTERS.

     EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT

     THE GIGANTIC VEHICLE ROLLS OVER A DOZEN TIMES BEFORE SLIDING
     INTO A SAND RAVINE.

     Smoke drifts from the wreckage...

     INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT

     Taryn retrieves a form.

                          TARYN
                Your blood test confirms that
                there is mescaline in your blood.
                But then that's nothing new. You
                have a history of drug use, don't
                you?

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                Now the bitch was getting
                personal.

                          TARYN
                That's the only way you can cope
                with the route your life has
                taken. The fact that you made the
                choice to pursue this life-
                style... much to the chagrin of
                your mother... who is so clearly
                ashamed of you.
                    (beat)
                Imagine her shame when we cart
                you off to prison because you
                won't just tell the truth about
                what really happened.

     EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAY FOR NIGHT [MESCALINE TRIP]


     The CAMERA SLOWLY APPROACHES the side of the wrecked RV. The
     BLANK VISAGES of DANCING WOMEN IN BIKINIS stare up at the stars
     with airbrushed eyes.

     DEBRIS is scattered about the desert. Domino's GOLDFISH do their
     dance of DEATH on the sandy floor.

     The SIDE DOOR to the Winnebago SLAMS OPEN... it's Domino. She is
     bruised and battered. She is TRIPPING OUT OF HER MIND. IMAGES
     CASCADE over one another under a PURPLE SKY.

     She staggers into the desert, trying to find the others but
     there is no one around. She is all alone.

     By her feet, a SHIMMERING ORANGE LIGHT in the sand catches her
     eye. It's her GOLDFISH, dancing its dance of death in the sand.
     She tries to save it but it's too late.

     Domino begins to tremble... the eight-year-old inside emerges...
     she drops to her knees and weeps. In her moment of need, an
     ANGEL appears... FLOATING it seems over the desert touching
     nothing, not even the sand. The Angel kneels beside her...

                          ANGEL
                Everything is going to be
                alright.

                          DOMINO
                I don't want to be alone.

     Domino catches a glimpse of Ziering and Green... wandering out
     into the sand... vomiting.

     It's not until the Angel envelops her with his arms and lifts
     her from the sand that his face becomes clear. It is Choco.

                          CHOCO
                You are not alone.

     As TIME AND SPACE shift and change all around, they hold on to
     one another for dear life. From this embrace, they begin to
     kiss... undressing one another. They begin to have CRAZY SEX.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK:

     EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- DAWN

     Domino is being cradled by Choco. He is pouring BOTTLED WATER
     over her head. Stroking her hair gently. The WIND whistles
     through the early morning light.

                          CHOCO
                You are cleansed.

     Domino's eyes flutter open. This is the first time Choco has
     spoken English to Domino. Alf and Ed are standing there...
     bloody and bruised.

                          CHOCO (CONT'D)
                She's awake.

     The Winnebago lays turned over in the sand. Ziering and Green
     lean up against it. Green has an ICE PACK on his head. ziering
     is bleeding from several outs.

                          ZIERING
                Someone's coming!

     Ziering points WEST. A RED FORD PICKUP TRUCK approaches on a
     TINY DESERT SIDE ROAD. The Red Truck stops... and an old INDIAN
     MAN, the WANDERER (70s), steps out.

     The Wanderer slowly approaches the group. Domino is standing
     there with Ed, Choco and Alf.

     He stares at them for a long moment... studying them.

                          WANDERER
                If you do not return this money,
                you will all die.
                    (pointing to Domino)
                You are the angel of fire. You
                burn bright enough to know that
                sometimes certain sacrifices must
                be made.

     Domino just stares out at the vast expanse of desert earth. The
     Wanderer's voice echoes through her head.

                          WANDERER (CONT'D)
                A great puzzle has formed. Within
                the puzzle... there is a child. A
                sick child. She will grow up to
                be great world leader some day.
                    (beat)
                Do you know what child I speak
                of?

                          DOMINO
                Yes.

                          WANDERER
                Your destiny is this: You must
                be willing to offer your lives in
                exchange for the life of this
                child.

                    (beat)
                Only then will you truly be
                cleansed in the eyes of God.

                          CHOCO
                Will we survive this sacrifice?

                          WANDERER
                    (beat)
                Only one of you will survive.

     Choco stares at the others... his fingers intertwined with
     Domino's.

                          ED
                Which one of us?

                          WANDERER
                That I do not know.

     Domino retrieves the S!LVER DOLLAR from her pocket. she looks at
     the others... then back at the Wanderer.

                          DOMINO
                Take us to Vegas.

     EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY

     The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas.

     INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT

     Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.

                          TARYN
                This is your last chance. Tell us
                everything you know.

     Domino lights a cigarette. Her strength has returned.

                          DOMINO
                Do you want know the real reason
                why I became a bounty hunter?

                          TARYN
                No. Please enlighten me.

                          DOMINO
                I became a bounty hunter because
                of cunts like you.
                    (beat)
                I remember all the cunts in high
                school who were mean to me.
                Eventually... they all grew up to
                be just like you. Angry and
                bitter because they peaked
                early... and now they're stuck in
                some dead end marriage... or
                worse yet... an unfulfilling job
                that keeps them from meeting a
                man.

     Domino stares her up and down... taking a drag from her
     Marlboro.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                But that's not the case with you,
                is it Taryn? Because I bet when
                you go to sleep alone tonight...
                it's my pussy you'll be dreaming
                of.

     Taryn looks legitimately turned on... but she's too tough to
     lose track.

                          TARYN
                We discovered the bodies early
                this morning.

     EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- MORNING


     Taryn, Cosgrove and Espinoza emerge from a pair of SUBURBANS at
     a LARGE TENT erected in the desert. There are PRESS HELICOPTERS
     circling above.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                The FBI was lying. The guys we
                nabbed weren't dead after all.

     SMASH CUT TO CLOUDS: The SILVER DOLLAR descends...

     A GOON with a SHOVEL sighs in frustration.

                          GOON #1
                Fuck 'em... they don't know.

     The IMAGINARY BULLETS REWIND from the bodies of FRANCES,
     CHUCKlE, CARL and LESTER...

     INT. TENT -- NEXT

     Frances, Chuckie, Carl and Lester are BURIED UP TO THEIR NECKS
     in the sand. They are sunburned and pissed off. FBI AGENTS are
     grilling them, trying to get information out of them.

     Cosgrove and Espinoza are overseeing the whole scene.

                          COSGROVE
                This could work in our favor. Let
                Cigliuti think that his kids are
                dead.

                          ESPINOZA
                And then we can flush out Bishop
                and Cigliuti in the money
                exchange. Fucking take down of
                the century.


     EXT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- SWIMMING POOL -- NEXT

     Several MOBSTERS tread underneath the surface of the swimming
     pool at the CIGLIUTI COMPOUND. They have the YELLOW JAPANESE
     PHONES connecting their ears to mouthpieces.

                          MOBSTER (PHONE)
                The FBI is out there right now
                excavating the bodies. Bishop
                whacked Frances and Chuckie.

     BY THE POOL... Anthony Cigliuti sits at a TABLE next to his
     SOBBING WIFE. His eyes are filled with rage and sorrow. He turns
     to one of the other MOBSTERS... approaching from the pool with a
     TOWEL around his waist.

                          MOBSTER (CONT'D)
                What's our option?

     The RAGE is building.

                          CIGLIUTI
                Kill 'em. Kill 'em all.

     The CAMERA MOVES in toward a FLOWER POT on the table.

     INT. FBI JET -- NEXT

     Several FBI AGENTS are listening from the JET as it flies over
     Vegas.

                          CIGLIUTI (PHONE)
                Kill 'em. Kill 'em all.

                          MOBSTER (PHONE)
                When?

                          CIGLIUTI (PHONE)
                Tonight. Get it done tonight.

     FBI AGENT #1 reaches for a PHONE.

                          FBI AGENT #1
                Cigliuti just ordered a hit on
                Drake Bishop. It's going to
                happen tonight.

     EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- NEXT


     Taryn, Cosgrove and Espinoza rush toward their SUBURBANS...
     SCREAMING into their phones.

     INT. TENT -- NEXT

     Frances, Chuckie, Carl and Lester are finally being excavated
     from their graves by the FBI. They CRY in relief... chugging
     BOTTLED WATER under the MASSIVE TENT.

     EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP -- SUNSET

     HELICOPTER SHOT: The CAMERA soars across the strip at SUNSET...
     approaching the CIRCUS CIRCUS HOTEL/CASINO.

     INT. CIRCUS CIRCUS -- LOBBY -- NEXT


     Ziering and Green walk through the SHIT LOBBY of the CIRCUS
     CIRCUS... following Domino, Ed, Choco and Alf. All of them still
     look like hell... reeling from the mescaline.

                          ZIERING
                We didn't sign on for this shit.
                    (beat)
                Fuck! This shit is intense. I
                need to call my agent.

                          GREEN
                Just shut up and do what they
                say. They're gonna kill us if we
                don't, Ian.

     Domino turns back to Ziering and Green.

                          DOMINO
                I need you to book us a luxury
                suite. Put it on your credit
                card.

     INT. CIRCUS CIRCUS -- CASINO BAR -- NEXT

     Claremont sits in the casino bar. He watches Ziering and Ed
     walk past toward the elevators. Claremont dials a number on his
     phone.

     INT. STRATOSPHERE -- ROOF RESTAURANT -- NEXT


     Drake Bishop and Burke Beckett are in the empty TOP OF THE WORLD
     restaurant in the STRATOSPHERE... surrounded by various GOONS.
     HUGE WINDOWS over look the entire city.

     The TELEPHONE rings. Bishop picks up.

                          BISHOP
                This is Bishop.

                          CLAREMONT (PHONE)
                The Bounty Hunters have arrived.
                They will drop off the money in
                exactly one hour.
                    (beat)
                Where do you want to meet?

                          BISHOP
                Top of the World at the
                Stratosphere. It's completely
                secure.

     INT. FBI JET -- NEXT

     Cosgrove and Espinoza listen to this conversation.


     EXT. CIGLIUTI COMPOUND -- NEXT

     Cigliuti sits in the KITCHEN with various MOBSTER relatives.
     Someone hands him a phone.

                          CIGLIUTI
                Yes?

                          COSGROVE (PHONE)
                The money exchange with Drake
                Bishop will occur on the top
                floor suite of the Stratosphere
                at exactly midnight.

     The phone disconnects. Cigliuti turns to the other mobsters.

                          CIGLIUTI
                We have ourselves a Negro Deep
                Throat.

     INT. FBI JET -- NEXT

     Cosgrove turns to Espinoza.

                          COSGROVE
                DID I SOUND TOUGH ENOUGH?!!!

     INT. CIRCUS CIRCUS -- LUXURY SUITE -- LATER ON

     Choco, Ed, Ziering and Green are all freshly showered... pacing
     around the shitty luxury suite... tripping hard. Domino stares
     out at the city... the mescaline still pulsing through her
     veins.


     INT. CIRCUS CIRCUS -- SUITE BATHROOM -- NEXT

     Alf is in the bathroom staring at hL~self in the mirror. He has
     a cup of Edna's MESCALINE COFFEE sitting on the counter. He
     takes an EYE DROPPER and dips it into his coffee... then dangles
     the dropper over his EYEBALL.

     INT. CIRCUS CIRCUS -- LUXURY SUITE -- NEXT

     There is a KNOCK at the door. Domino peers through the PEEPHOLE.
     LATEESHA and her crew are there. Domino opens the door.

                          DOMINO
                Lateesha.

                          LATEESHA
                Domino.

     Lashandra, Lashindra and Raoul enter the hotel room.

                          DOMINO
                What the hell have you gotten us
                into?

                          LATEESHA
                Claremont negotiated a finder's
                fee of $300,000. All we want is
                that money off the top.

                          ED
                Fuck that! You set us up!

                          LATEESHA
                I had to throw the FBI a bone or
                they was gonna nail me to the
                wall. I don't know how this
                happened. If I could take it all
                back I would.

     Domino paces around the suite anxiously.

                          DOMINO
                They're gonna kill us unless we
                deliver all of the money.
                    (beat)
                Why should I help you?

     Tears begin to flow from Lateesha's eyes. She wipes them...
     turbo nails trembling.

                          LASHANDRA
                Meeka's white blood cell count is
                dropping fast.

                          LASHINDRA
                Real fast.

     Domino stares at Lateesha... beginning to understand. She
     clutches the SILVER DOLLAR in her grip.

                          LATEESHA
                $300,000. We need to collect that
                fee... right now. It will pay for
                the entire operation.

     Domino closes her eyes... turning to the others... looking for
     permission to grant Lateesha's request. Ed nods his head slowly
     in a Mescaline haze. Choco follows his lead.

                          DOMINO
                Okay.

     Domino knocks on the bathroom door... again and again. We hear
     Alf muttering into his phone.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                ALF! WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING
                IN THERE!?

     The bathroom door explodes open 1/2 inch. An AMPHETAMINE EYEBALL
     fills the gap.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                Cut the drama and pullout 300K
                from one of the bags.

     Alf begins to shove money through the crack in the door in
     sizable increments. He then slams the door.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                THANKS, A-HOLE!


     INT. CIRCUS CIRCUS -- LUXURY SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER

     Lateesha places the duffel bag over her shoulder... turning back
     to Domino at the door.

                          LATEESHA
                I love you, Domino.

     Lateesha embraces Domino.

                          DOMINO
                Don't blow it.

     Lateesha waves at them and moves out the door with her crew...
     closing the door behind her.

     Domino turns back to her FAMILY...

                          ED
                We are so fucked.

                          DOMINO
                Then so be it. If you believe
                what that Indian said we were
                fucked either way.

     She flips the SILVER DOLLAR through her fingers. The TELEPHONE
     rings. Ed answers it.

                          ED
                Hello?

                          CLAREMONT (PHONE)
                The money exchange will take
                place at Top of the World at the
                Stratosphere. Get there at
                exactly midnight.

                          DOMINO
                Okay.

                          CLAREMONT (PHONE)
                I won't forget this, Domino. I'm
                sorry it turned out like this...

     Ed snatches the phone from her.

                          ED
                Tell your friends that we have
                celebrity hostages. So no more
                funny stuff, Claremont! You can't
                bury a celebrity body in the
                desert without some motherfucker
                from E! Entertainment television
                sniffing down the case.

     Ziering and Green's faces are white with terror.


     EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRSTRIP -- MOMENTS LATER

     Cosgrove and Espinoza run across an AIRSTRIP where an FBI
     HELICOPTER is waiting.

                          COSGROVE
                LET'S GO! LET'S GO!

     Taryn watches them go.

     EXT. CIRCUS CIRCUS -- VALET PARKING

     Ziering, Green and Alf struggle with the DUFFEL BAGS... getting
     them into the TRUNK of a CAB. Alf closes the trunk. He makes eye
     contact with the ARABIC DRIVER of the cab.

     Another CAB pulls up into the valet entrance. Another Arabic
     driver. Alf seems to know him. The driver throws him an Afghani
     salute.

     Domino comes out into the valet area with Ed and Choco.

                          ALF
                You take that cab, we take this
                one.

     Ed and Choco step into the cab with Ziering and Green. Domino
     rides with Alf.

     EXT. STRATOSPHERE -- ENTRANCE -- LATER ON

     Domino and the rest of her crew approach the crowded entrance to
     the Stratosphere. There are FOUR GOONS waiting at the entrance
     among throngs of YOUNG PEOPLE.
     
     Alf unloads the FOUR LARGE CANVASS BAGS onto a luggage cart.

                          GOON #1
                We need to frisk you.

                          DOMINO
                No need to bother.

     Domino nods to Ed and Choco. They both remove their GUNS.


     INT. STRATOSPHERE -- LOBBY -- NEXT

     The Goons lead them through the crowded casino... filled with
     young people. They approach the bank of ELEVATORS with the
     trolly and the bags... moving through a X-RAY SECURITY GATE.

     INT. STRATOSPHERE -- ELEVATOR -- NEXT

     They ride up to the top floor in SILENT DREAD. Alf begins to
     twitch from the mescaline. Ziering puts his hand on Green's
     shoulder. His face is completely white with terror.

                          ZIERING
                    (whispering)
                You're my best friend, B.A.

     Green nods his head slowly back at Ziering. Domino retrieves the
     SILVER DOLLAR from her pocket and begins to flip it between her
     fingers.


     INT. STRATOSPHERE -- ROOF RESTAURANT -- NEXT

     The Goons lead them out of the elevator into the HALLWAY that
     leads to the TOP OF THE WORLD. Beckett is waiting there for
     them. Claremont is there too. Alf pushes the luggage cart.

                          GOON #1
                They're clean.

     Drake Bishop turns from the PICTURE WINDOWS that overlook the
     entire strip. He looks Domino up and down.

                          BISHOP
                Welcome to the Top of the World.
                I thought privacy might be in
                order for the nature of the
                business that we're conducting.

     Bishop glances at Alf... who is SWEATING PROFUSELY... then at
     Ziering and Green. He approaches the actors... sizing them up.

                          BISHOP (CONT'D)
                Where have I seen you two before?

     Sweat pours down Ziering's face.

                          ZIERING
                We're... actors.

                          BISHOP
                What the fuck are you doing here?

                          GREEN
                We're celebrity hostages.

     Ziering has now begun to cry.

                          BISHOP
                Celebrity hostages.

                          ZIERING
                They think you won't kill them if
                we're in the room. People don't
                kill other people... when there
                are celebrities present.

                          BISHOP
                I see.
                    (chuckling)
                We'll I better have you escorted
                downstairs then.

     Bishop nods his head to two of the goons. They grab Ziering and
     Green and take them away. Green throws Domino a fleeting glance
     as he walks away.

     Bishop turns back to face Domino.

                          BISHOP (CONT'D)
                You're a bounty hunter?

                          DOMINO
                Yes I am.

     Bishop nods his head curiously.

                          BISHOP
                Is it a dangerous profession?

                          DOMINO
                Sometimes.

                          BISHOP
                Can you be more specific?

     Domino thinks for a moment.

                          DOMINO
                It can be dangerous when you
                don't know what to expect from a
                situation.
                    (beat)
                When you have no idea what could
                possibly happen next.

     Bishop smiles at Domino.

     INT. STRATOSPHERE -- ELEVATOR -- NEXT

     Ziering and Green ride down in the elevator with the Goons. They
     reach the BOTTOM FLOOR and the doors open.

     CIGLIUTI and more than a DOZEN MAFIA GUYS waiting there. They
     glare at Ziering and Green as they walk past... escaping into
     the night.

     INT. STRATOSPHERE -- ROOF RESTAURANT -- NEXT

     Bishop looks down at the DUFFEL BAGS.

                          BISHOP
                Gentlemen, check and see if our
                money is all there... then let
                these bounty hunters go.

                          DOMINO
                There is ten million here. Minus
                the $300,000 finders fee you
                agreed to pay Claremont.

     Alf fumbles for the keys to the locks on the bags. Bishop takes
     a puff from his cigar... assessing Domino once again.

                          BISHOP
                Bold move, Ms. Harvey. I think I
                can give you this one.

     The GOONS begin to unzip the DUFFEL BAGS... retrieving stack
     after stack of PORNO NEWSPAPERS... dropping them on the floor.

     GOON #2 looks over at GOON #1 bitterly.

                          GOON #2
                It's nothing but a bunch of
                porno.

                          GOON #1
                It's all porno.

     Bishop tries to remain calm. Choco and Ed look at Domino in
     disbelief.

                          ED
                What the fuck?

     Bishop turns to Domino... who looks shocked and terrified... a
     young girl Once again...

                          BISHOP
                Would you care to explain
                yourself?

     Domino is frozen. Ed and Choco stare at one another in horror.
     Alf is sweating like a pig... eyes darting in every direction
     from the mescaline.

                          BISHOP (CONT'D)
                Ms. Harvey... what happened to my
                money?!!

     Domino seems lost in a trance... resigned to die. She clutches
     the SILVER DOLLAR.

     ALF STEPS FORWARD.

                          ALF
                Your money is gone. It has been
                sent to help free Afghanistan.
                This is all that's left.
                    (long beat)
                It's called APATT.

                          BISHOP
                APATT. What the fuck is APATT?

     SMASH CUT TO: The ARABIC CAB DRIVER speeds away from Circus
     Circus.

     INT. STRATOSPHERE HOTEL -- EMERGENCY STAIRS -- NEXT

     Cigliuti and his GOONS rush up the stairs... armed to the teeth.


     INT. STRATOSPHERE -- ROOF RESTAURANT -- NEXT

     Domino closes her eyes... realizing what just transpired.

                          DOMINO
                    (resigned to die)
                All porno... all the time.
                    (beat)
                It's an epidemic.

     One of the goons is rifling through the porno in the bag and
     comes out with a BLUE POWDER on his fingers. He then sniffs it.

                          ED
                Pervert.

                          GOON #1
                It's... C-4.

     Suddenly... Alf removes a TELEVISION REMOTE from his pocket.

     A SMALL RED LIGHT flashes on one of the black canvass bags.

                          ALF
                LET US GO! LET US GO... OR I BLOW
                THIS NEEDLE TO OUTER SPACE!

     Before Bishop has a chance to respond... CIGLIUTI AND HIS MAFIA
     GOONS BUST INTO THE LUXURY SUITE... GUNS BLAZING.

                          MAFIA GOON #1
                DROP YOUR WEAPONS!

     The GOONS refuse to listen.

                          GOON #1
                FUCK YOU!

     SCREAMING MAYHEM ENSUES.


     EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP -- NEXT

     The FBI HELICOPTER approaches the STRATOSPHERE.

     INT. FBI HELICOPTER -- NEXT

     Inside... Espinoza and Cosgrove direct the pilot toward the
     VEGAS SPACE NEEDLE.

     INT. STRATOSPHERE -- TOP FLOOR -- NEXT

     The SCREAMING MAYHEM dies down as everyone realizes that Alf is
     a REAL BOMB connected to his remote control detonator.

                          ALF
                LET US GO OR WE ALL DIE!!

                          BISHOP
                You've got to be kidding me!

     SLOW MOTION: The CAMERA slowly approaches Domino as she notices
     an ETHEREAL GLOW outside the windows of the space needle.

     IT IS THE FBI HELICOPTER... SHINING A MASSIVE SPOTLIGHT THROUGH
     THE WINDOWS.

     MAFIA GOONS BEGIN TO FIRE THEIR GUNS.

     BISHOP AND BECKETT ARE TORN APART LIKE RAG DOLLS. GOONS FALL
     BACK AGAINST EXPLODING FURNITURE. PORNO PAPERS EXPLODE LIKE
     CONFETTI.

     ALF GRABS DOMINO AND PULLS HER TOWARD THE ELEVATOR AT THE END OF
     THE HALLWAY. CHOCO AND ED FOLLOW.

     A BULLET STRIKES CHOCO IN THE ARM AS HE RUSHES FOR THE ELEVATOR.
     HE SPINS, DROPS TO THE FLOOR.

     ED, ALREADY WAITING IN THE ELEVATOR AND SCARED SHITLESS,
     ABANDONS HIS COVER AND PULLS CHOCO INSIDE.


     EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP -- NEXT

     THE FBI HELICOPTER SPINS AROUND IN RETREAT FROM THE HOTEL. A
     GOON FIRES OFF HIS AUTOMATIC WEAPON TOWARD THE CHOPPER.

     INT. FBI HELICOPTER -- NEXT

     A BULLET HITS THE PILOT IN THE NECK. BLOOD EXPLODES.

     THE CHOPPER BEGINS TO SPIN OUT OF CONTROL. Espinoza and Cosgrove
     scream out.

                          ESPINOZA
                FUCK!

     INT. STRATOSPHERE ELEVATOR -- NEXT

     Alf shoves Domino into the elevator with Choco and Ed. Ed
     clamps down on Choco's bleeding wound.

                          ED
                We're gonna make it. All of us.
                That Indian was wrong!

     This gets a smile out of Choco.

     Alf stands in the HALLWAY with the REMOTE CONTROL DETONATOR in
     his right hand... nodding his head.

                          ALF
                I MAKE EVERYTHING OKAY!!

     AFGHANI STANDOFF - Alf stands in front of the elevator door, TV
     remote in hand, heavy firepower aimed at him.

     THE ELEVATOR DOORS CLOSE.

     SMASH CUT TO CLOUDS: The SILVER DOLLAR flips upward once
     again...

     INT. STRATOSPHERE -- TOP FLOOR -- NEXT

     Alf rushes toward the elevator with the remote detonator out...
     catching his arm in between the doors. The doors close on the
     remote.

     ALF REACHES OUT TO STOP THE DOORS FROM CLOSING... LODGING THE
     REMOTE CONTROL BETWEEN THE METAL DOORS.

     A RED LIGHT GOES ON...


     EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP -- NEXT

     A HUGE FIREBALL EXPLODES OUT OF THE TOP OF THE STRATOSPHERE.

     INT. STRATOSPHERE -- ELEVATOR -- NEXT

     THE EXPLOSION ROCKS THE ELEVATOR... SEVERING THE WIRES THAT HOLD
     THE METAL CAGE IN PLACE. THEY BEGIN TO PLUMMET DOWN THE SHAFT.

     SLOW MOTION: DOMINO LOOKS ACROSS THE ELEVATOR AT ED AND CHOCO AS
     THEIR BODIES BECOME WEIGHTLESS... FLOATING THROUGH THE AIR IN A
     FREEFALL. THEY LOCK EYES.

                          CHOCO
                    (screaming out)
                I LOVE YOU, DOMINO.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                I once vowed never to invest too
                much emotion into anyone,
                anything.

     DOMINO GLANCES DOWN AT HER HAND AND SEES THE SILVER DOLLAR FLOAT
     UP INTO THE AIR.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                In our descent into hell
                together, I'm glad I made this
                one exception.

     THE ROOF OF THE ELEVATOR IS NOW GONE. MICHELANGELO'S HEAVEN
     GLOWS ABOVE DOMINO... AS HER QUARTER FLOATS UP AND OUT OF THE
     ELEVATOR INTO THE BLUE SKY ABOVE.

     THE ELEVATOR HURTLES DOWN TOWARD THE LOBBY AND HELL BENEATH IT.

     FLASH CUT: DOMINO (8) IN THE CATHEDRAL... LOOKING UP.

     INT. STRATOSPHERE -- LOBBY -- NEXT

     As the ELEVATOR SMASHES DOWN ON IMPACT... the ELEVATOR WALL
     COLLAPSES into the lobby in a fury of SMOKE.


     EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP -- NEXT

     THE FBI HELICOPTER SPINS OUT of CONTROL... CRASHING INTO THE
     PARKING LOT OF CIRCUS CIRCUS... EXPLODING INTO A BALL OF FIRE.

     THE CAMERA FLOATS THROUGH THE CITY NIGHT... CATCHING A TORN
     PIECE OF PORNOGRAPHY... A WOMAN'S NAKED BODY FLUTTERING AWAY AND
     INTO THE NIGHT.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK:

     SILENCE.

                          ROBOTIC FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                Now serving F134. Please report
                to window eight.

     The rumble of a HELICOPTER emerges from the darkness.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                When I was a little girl... my
                mum took me to Las Vegas. She
                told me that it was the most
                dangerous place on earth.

     EXT. STRATOSPHERE -- TEETER TOTTER -- [FLASHBACK] NIGHT

     YEARS AGO... DOMINO and SOPHIE on the TEETER TOTTER RIDE mounted
     on top of the stratosphere... hanging above the abyss of desert
     lights... screaming with exhilaration.


     EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP -- DAWN

     HELICOPTER SHOT: The CAMERA approaches the mayhem of carnage
     that was once the Stratosphere. There are AMBULANCES and FIRE
     TRUCKS everywhere.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                She told me that if you weren't
                careful... you could lose
                everything you'd ever earned in
                life in a split second.
                    (beat)
                You have to know when to cash
                out.

     INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT

     Domino Harvey sits on the metal table, alive and well, somewhat
     of a disheveled and bloody appearance.

     Taryn puts her hand to her EARPIECE... shaking her head in
     disgust as security comes in to escort Domino out.

                          TARYN
                    (broken... finally)
                I suggest you retire... Ms.
                Harvey.

     Domino turns back to Taryn as she leaves.

                          DOMINO
                Sweet dreams... Ms. Miles.


     EXT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- EARLY MORNING

     Domino swims underwater... emerging from the pool. Sophie is
     there... in her lounge chair. Her little dog asleep next to her.

                          DOMINO
                I love you, mum.

     Sophie smiles at her daughter.

                          DOMINO (CONT'D)
                Time to go shopping.

     Sophie lowers her sunglasses. Finally... the words she has
     longed to hear from her daughter's mouth.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                There are three kinds of people
                in the world. The rich...

     EXT. AFGHANISTAN CAMP -- DAY

     A group of AFGHANI CHILDREN opens a HUGE FED-EX BOX... filled
     with CASH. They scream and yell... pulling out the money.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                The poor...

     EXT. UCLA MEDICAL CENTER -- SEVERAL DAYS LATER

     Lateesha, Kee Kee, Lashandra, Lashindra, Claremont and Raoul sit
     in the HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM. Kee Kee paces around nervously.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                And everyone in between.

     Claremont approaches... putting his hand on her shoulder.

                          CLAREMONT
                    (gentle whisper)
                We must learn to channel our
                horniness into extracurricular
                activities such as modern dance,
                Taichi, and erotic Chia art.

                          KEE KEE
                What the fuck is erotic Chia art?

     He hands her a CHIA-PET carved with GIGANTIC BREASTS.

     INT. MRI MACHINE -- NEXT


     MEEKA lays on her back as she is slowly pulled back into the
     TUNNEL of an MRI MACHINE.

                          DOMINO (V.O.)
                If you're wondering what's true
                and what isn't... you can fuck
                off... because it's none of your
                Goddamn business. I'll never
                tell you what it all meant.
                    (beat)
                All that matters is that my
                mission is complete. I saved
                her.

     The FULL BODY X-RAY DEVICE scans over her entire body.

                          DOMINO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                And when she is older... a woman
                named Domino will tell her that
                there is only one conclusion to
                every story.

                    (beat)
                We all fall down.

     The baby smiles helplessly at the CAMERA.
