FADE IN:

INT. A MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY

A few patients sit around fumbling with themselves. One man
sits at a table scratching back and forth on a piece of paper
with a crayon. Another stands in a corner smoking a cigarette
and staring at the crayon guy. This is CHARLES. Another man,
KARL, sits in a chair staring at the floor and rubbing his
hands together. We cut back and forth between Charles staring
and Crayon Man scratching. After a moment, an attendant
approaches Charles.

               ATTENDANT
     You can't smoke in here.

Charles stares at him blankly for a moment and continues
smoking. He looks back to Crayon Man again for a moment then
looks over at Karl and then goes and sits down beside him.

               CHARLES
     A Mercury is a good car and that's
     what I was driving that day. I've
     owned a lot of cars. Different
     kinds. Lots of different kinds of
     cars. She was standing, this girl,
     on the side of the street where
     there was a chicken stand; not the
     Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless
     a chicken stand, and I pulled the
     Mercury over and rolled down the
     window by electric power. She was
     wearing a leather skirt and she had
     a lot of hair on her arms. I like
     that. I like it a lot. It means a
     big bush. I like a big bush. She
     said, "Are you dating?" I said,
     "yes," and she got in the car. We
     pulled to a remote location, one
     that she and I both felt
     comfortable with and she said, "How
     much can you spend?" I said, "What
     it takes to see your bush. I know
     it's a big one." She said "twenty
     five dollars," which to a working
     man is not chicken feed. I produced
     the money and she put it in her
     shoe and pulled up her skirt. There
     before me lay a thin, crooked,
     uncircumcised penis. You can
     imagine how badly I wanted my
     twenty-five dollars back.

INT. A HALLWAY - DAY

Two young women, MARSHA DWIGGINS, carrying a briefcase, and
THERESA EVANS, carrying two camera bags are being led down
the hallway by a GUARD.

               THERESA
     I don't know why you're so weirded
     out, this is not San Quentin, it's
     just a nuthouse. Most of these
     people don't even know where they
     are, they're not gonna hurt you.

               MARSHA
     In a few minutes we're gonna be in
     a room with a killer. That doesn't
     bother you?

               THERESA
     Hey, you're the one that wanted to
     major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't
     the guy something like twelve or
     thirteen when he did it, it was
     twenty-five years ago, he probably
     doesn't even remember it.

               MARSHA
          (wrinkling her nose)
     Do you smell shit?

               THERESA
     Yeah.

They reach a door and the guard ushers them through.

INT. AN OFFICE - DAY

JERRY WOOLRIDGE stands up from behind the desk as they enter.
He's in his fifiles and looks like a school teacher, shop
class or perhaps eighth-grade science.

               GUARD
     These are the people from that
     newspaper deal.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Oh yeah, from the college?

               MARSHA
     Yes sir.

Woolridge shakes hands with them.

               WOOLRIDGE
     My name's Jerry Woolridge.

               MARSHA
     Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha
     Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans.
     She's here to take the pictures.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Y'all have a seat. Is this all of
     you?

               MARSHA
     Yes sir.

               WOOLRIDGE
     I think there must have been a
     little mix up. I told your sponsor
     or teacher or whatever he is, there
     couldn't be any pictures. It's
     s'posed to be just a little story
     or article or something, isn't that
     right?

               MARSHA
     Well, yeah, it's for the school
     newspaper. But it has pictures. I
     mean it's a regular paper, you
     know.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Karl's real sensitive about having
     his picture made. He wouldn't even
     be on the bulletin board for the
     Easter Collage.
          (to guard)
     Melvin, would you get me a good hot
     cup with two sugar substitutes? You
     girls want some coffee?

               MARSHA
     No thank you.

               WOOLRIDGE
     The other thing is I told your boss
     on the phone to send a man. Karl
     won't talk to women.

INT. REC ROOM - DAY

CLOSE UP on Karl's face. Charles has started another
monologue.

               CHARLES
     There was a young man named John
     Liggit Hunter who was in the
     filling station business and a good
     filling station business. He was
     one of those young men that we run
     across so often in life. I'm sure
     you've run across them, that didn't
     deserve the things he had. One of
     those things was his beautiful
     bride, Sarah. She was a Georgia
     Peach. As a matter of fact she
     looked more like the picture I've
     had in my head than any woman I've
     ever seen. I took it upon myself to
     take her away from John Liggit
     Hunter, who didn't deserve her. I'm
     not sure if I mentioned that he was
     a Frenchman who claimed to be an
     Englishman. It took some very
     strong nylon cord to take her away
     from him. She was a fighter as well
     as a Georgia Peach.

INT. WOOLRIDGE'S OFFICE

The girls look confused.

               WOOLRIDGE
     I don't know what to tell you. I'm
     sorry. I made myself pretty clear I
     thought. He probably got busy and
     wasn't thinking. I know how that
     is. I used to teach shop and eighth
     grade science.

               MARSHA
     Well, what do we do? We drove all
     the way out here.

               THERESA
     Let's just go, Marsha.

               MARSHA
     No, we have to get this story.

               THERESA
     I thought you'd be happy to leave.

               MARSHA
     Why won't he talk to women?

               WOOLRIDGE
     He has problems. You know. With all
     that. He won't hardly talk to
     anybody really. Just certain
     people. He's very troubled.

INT. REC ROOM

               CHARLES
          (leaning in to Karl)
     A shovel just makes too goddamn
     much racket.

INT. WOOLRIDGE'S OFFICE

               WOOLRIDGE
          (takes a drink of coffee)
     I don't think he's talked to a
     woman in twenty-five or so years.
     That I know of anyway. That's why I
     said to send a man. At least maybe
     he'd answer a question or two for a
     man. I'm all for helping the
     college out, believe me. It might
     be a real good article or story.

               MARSHA
     Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk
     him into it. I'm a real good
     interviewer. Just get me in the
     room with him.

               WOOLRIDGE
          (to guard)
     Melvin, go get Karl and take him
     down to the old classroom.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Woolridge and the two women walk down the hallway.

               WOOLRIDGE
     I'll talk to him and see what we
     can do.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Woolridge is opening a door. He enters and the women follow
him in. He flips on a light switch and very bright florescent
lights illuminate the room.

               WOOLRIDGE
     You see, Karl, growing up, only
     knew that sex was wrong and that
     people who did it should be killed
     for it. He couldn't really read
     but, well, neither could his
     mother. But, his father made sure
     that his mother knew what the Bible
     said. And she made sure Karl knew.
     You know he slept in a hole in the
     ground under a toolshed, right?

               MARSHA
     I knew he slept in a toolshed.

               WOOLRIDGE
     His mother told him that he was
     their punishment. Hers and his
     father's; from God, for having sex--

               MARSHA
     Before they were married?

               WOOLRIDGE
     I don't think so. Just period, I
     think. She told him... God gave
     them the ugliest creation he could
     think of. Karl has an entire book --
     a notebook. On every page it says
     "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number
     1." He wrote that a few years ago
     after he'd learned to write. His
     father's name was Franklin.

               MARSHA
     That's really strange. What does it
     mean?

               WOOLRIDGE
     One of his Daddy's Bible lessons I
     imagine. Y'all pull up a chair.
     I'll go out and talk to him.

INT. REC ROOM

CLOSE UP on Charles's face.

               CHARLES
     You have to make something explode
     to truly understand it. You have to
     examine the tiny particles while
     they're on fire.

Off screen we hear FOOTSTEPS approaching. We pull back and
see MELVIN the guard.

               MELVIN
     Karl, I gotta take you down to the
     old classroom. Mr. Woolridge has
     some people for you to see down
     there. Come on. Let's go.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Melvin and Karl walk down the hallway. Woolridge stands
outside the door of the classroom. They reach him and
Woolridge talks quietly to Karl.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Karl, you know, do you remember
     when I told you about those people
     from that newspaper?
          (pause)
     They want to ask you some questions
     about your release. They think it
     would make an interesting story.
     Will you talk to 'em? Get
     interviewed.
          (pause)
     Now, they're women. I think it
     might be good for you to. You're
     gonna be seein' all kinds of people
     when you go on the outside. This'll
     help you I believe.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

It's just Woolridge and the two women in the room.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Well, it surprised the dickens out
     of me. He said he'll talk to you.

Marsha smiles and looks at Theresa.

               WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)
     But, here's the thing. He'll only
     talk to you. He doesn't want you to
     ask him anything. And you shouldn't
     stare at him.

               MARSHA
     How am I going to conduct an
     interview if I can't ask him any
     questions?

               WOOLRIDGE
     It's the best you're gonna get. I'm
     sorry.

               MARSHA
     Can I ask you a question? If he's
     so troubled, why are you letting
     him out? What if he does it again?
     It happens all the time.

               WOOLRIDGE
     He's free. His time's up. That's
     the rules. He's been treated and
     reevaluated. He doesn't show any
     signs any more.

               MARSHA
     Signs?

               WOOLRIDGE
     Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna
     change the light in here for Karl.
     I hope you can see to write.

Woolridge turns on a lamp on a desk and turns off the
overhead lights. He opens the door and Melvin brings Karl in.
In the semidarkness Woolridge pushes a chair up and motions
for Marsha to sit. Karl stands beside Melvin motionless.
Woolridge whispers to Theresa.

               WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)
     You'll have to step outside.

Theresa starts to protest.

               WOOLRIDGE (CONT'D)
     Please.

Karl sits down in a folding chair near a lamp as Melvin
ushers Theresa outside into the hallway. Karl sits staring at
the floor. Rubbing his palms together and breathing
strangely, as usual. He sits silent for what seems like
forever.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Theresa stands on one side of the door, Melvin on the other.

               THERESA
     Can I just sneak in there? I won't
     take any pictures, I promise. I
     just want to listen.

               MELVIN
     No ma'am. I'm sorry you can't.

Theresa takes a cigarette from her purse and starts to light
it.

               MELVIN (CONT'D)
     You can't smoke in here. I'm sorry.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Marsha is staring at Karl. Karl, still breathing and rubbing
his palms, starts to speak. His voice is low and raspy, but
not just low and raspy; strange.

               KARL
     Well, I reckon what you're a
     wanting to know is what I'm doing
     in here. I reckon the reason I'm in
     here is 'cause I killed somebody.
     But I reckon what you was a wanting
     to know is how come me to kill
     somebody. Well, I reckon I'll start
     at the front and tell you.
          (pause, heavy breathing)
     I lived most of my life out behind
     my mother and father's house in a
     little old shed and my daddy'd
     built for me. They didn't too much
     want me up there in the house with
     the rest of 'em. I mostly just set
     around out there in the shed all
     the time a lookin' at the ground.
     It didn't have no floor but I had
     me a hole dug out to lay down in
     and a quilt or tow that I put down
     there.
          (pause, more breathing)
     My daddy was a hard workin' man
     most of his life, not that I can
     say the same fer myself. I most
     just set around the shed and
     tinkered around with a lawn mower
     or two and went to school off and
     on from time to time but the
     children there made quite a bit of
     sport of me, made fun of me quite a
     bit. Some of 'em roughed me up
     sometimes so mostly I stayed out
     back there in the shed. My daddy
     worked down at the sawmill there,
     down there at the planer mill for
     an old man named Dixon.
     Old man Dixon was a very cruel
     feller, he didn't treat his
     employees very well, didn't pay 'em
     much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy
     much of a wage, just barely enough
     to get by on. But I reckon he got
     by all right, they come out one or
     the other of 'em, usually my
     mother, and fed me pretty regular.
     At least I know he made enough for
     me to have mustard and biscuits
     three or four times a week. Old man
     Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon.
     Jesse was really more cruel than
     his daddy. He made quite a bit of
     sport of me and takened advantage
     of the little girls around the
     neighborhood quite a bit.
          (pause)
     He used to say my mother was a very
     pretty woman. He said it quite a
     bit from time to time, when I was
     at the school house. Well, I reckon
     you want me to get on and tell you
     what happened so I reckon I'll tell
     you. I was settin' out in the shed
     one evenin' not doin' too much,
     just kindly starin' at the wall and
     a waitin' fer my mother to come out
     and give me my Bible lesson and I
     heared a commotion up in the house
     there so I got up and run up on the
     screened-in porch there to see what
     was a goin' on, and I looked in the
     kitchen window and I seen my mother
     a layin' there on the floor without
     any clothes on.
          (pause, breathing)
     And seen Jesse Dixon a layin' on
     top of her having his way with her.
          (pause)
     Well, I just seen red. I picked up
     a kaiser blade that was a layin'
     there by the screen door, some
     folks calls it a sling blade, I
     call it a kaiser blade. It's just a
     long handle like a axe handle with
     a long blade on it that's shaped
     kind of like a banana. Sharp on one
     edge and dull on the other. It's
     what the highway boys use to cut
     down weeds and whatnot.
     I went in the kitchen there and I
     hit Jesse Dixon up side the head
     with it and knocked him off my
     mother. I reckon that didn't quite
     satisfy me so I hit him again in
     the neck with the sharp edge and
     just plumb near cut his head off.
     Killed him. Well, my mother, she
     jumped up from there and started
     yellin', "What did you kill Jesse
     fer? What did you kill Jesse fer?"
          (pause, intense breathing)
     Well, come to find out my mother
     didn't really mind what Jesse was a
     doin' to her. I reckon that made me
     madder than what Jesse had made me.
     I takened the kaiser blade, some
     folks calls it a sling blade, I
     call it a kaiser blade and hit my
     mother up side the head with it an'
     killed her.
          (long pause, breathing)
     Some folks has asked me if I had it
     to do over again would I do the
     same thing. I don't know, I reckon
     I would. Anyhow, they seen fit to
     put me in here and here I've been
     for a great long while. I've
     learned to read some; took me four
     years to read the Bible. I reckon I
     understand a good deal of it. It
     wasn't what I expected in a lot of
     places. I've slept in a good bed
     for a great long while. They've
     seen fit to put me out now. They
     tell me they're a settin' me free
     today. Anyhow, I reckon that's all
     you need to know. If you want any
     more details I reckon I can tell
     'em to you. I don't know if that's
     enough for your newspaper or not.

Suddenly Marsha speaks from the darkness.

               MARSHA
     Will you ever kill anybody again,
     Karl?

This seems to startle the very room itself. Woolridge motions
for Marsha to shut up and Karl stops still. Very still. He
breathes hard for a moment then starts to calm down. He seems
almost at ease. He slowly looks up. From Karl's point of view
we barely see Marsha's face in the dim light. Karl is looking
straight at Marsha.

               KARL
          (slowly)
     I don't reckon I got no reason to
     kill nobody.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Woolridge stands just outside the classroom door with Marsha
and Theresa. Karl stands down the way a few feet with Melvin.

               MARSHA
     Is he leaving right this minute?

               WOOLRIDGE
     We've got some paperwork to take
     care of. Pretty soon. Don't worry,
     you won't run into him in the
     parking lot.

               MARSHA
     I didn't mean that.

               WOOLRIDGE
     I hope the best for you, Miss
     Dwiggins, with your school and your
     paper and all.

               MARSHA
     Where will he go?

               WOOLRIDGE
     Wherever he wants to. I think he's
     going back to Millsburg where he's
     from. It's just about twenty miles
     from here.

               MARSHA
     Will he be supervised?

               WOOLRIDGE
     As much as anybody else is, I
     guess. Y'all have a good rest of
     the day now.

Marsha and Theresa walk toward the exit. As they pass Karl he
speaks to Marsha.

               KARL
          (looking down)
     Thank you.

               MARSHA
          (immediately extends her
           hand)
     Thank you.

Karl doesn't take her hand.

Karl continues to stare at the floor until the women exit.

               KARL
     I reckon I'm gonna have to get used
     to looking at pretty people.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Yes, I guess you are.

               KARL
     I reckon I'm gonna have to get used
     to them lookin' at me, too.

               WOOLRIDGE
     You better go get your things.

               KARL
     I ain't got nothing but them books.

               WOOLRIDGE
     You better go get 'em.

               KARL
     All right then.

Karl walks slowly down the hallway.

EXT. BUS STATION - MILLSBURG - DAY

Karl steps off the bus carrying a few books by a strap. He
stands there for moment staring at the bus station as the few
people around stare at him, then he starts walking.

A SERIES OF SHOTS

Karl standing in front of a barbershop looking through the
window at a man having his hair cut.

In front of the police station.

Staring at an empty school yard...

EXT. DAIRY QUEEN - DAY

Karl stands and stares at the building for a moment. He sees
a woman take a tray of food from the window.
When she's gone, he walks up to the window. A pimply-faced
TEENAGE BOY comes to wait on him.

               BOY
     Can I help you?

               KARL
     I was kindly wantin' somethin' or
     'nother d'eat.

               BOY
     Well, what did you want?

               KARL
     You have any biscuits for sale?

               BOY
     Naw, we don't have biscuits.

Karl stands in silence for a moment.

               BOY (CONT'D)
     Did you decide, sir?

               KARL
     What you got that's good to eat?

               BOY
     Well, I guess it's all good.

               KARL
     What do you like to eat here?

               BOY
     French fries. I like to eat them
     pretty good.

               KARL
     French-fried potaters.

               BOY
     Yeah.

               KARL
     How much you want fer 'em? I'll get
     some of them I reckon.

               BOY
     Sixty for small and seventy-five
     for large.

               KARL
     Give me the big'uns.

Karl digs in his pocket for money.

EXT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY

Karl sits on a bench eating french fries. After a moment, a
twelve- or thirteen-year-old BOY comes out of the laundromat
wrestling three or four big bags of laundry. He can't seem to
get a plan together for carrying them all. Karl gets up and
goes over to him. The boy looks up at Karl, a little startled
by Karl's strange figure looming over him.

               BOY
     These dang things are heavy. Hard
     to carry, too.

               KARL
     What you got in there, warshing?

               BOY
     Yeah.

               KARL
     Ain't you got no mama and daddy to
     tend to it?

               BOY
     I got a mama, but she's at work
     over at Ben's Dollar Store. My
     daddy's dead.
          (pause)
     He got hit by a train.

               KARL
     How fer you going with them sacks
     full of warsh?

               BOY
     About a half a mile I think it is.

               KARL
     I'll help you tote 'em if I don't
     give out first.

               BOY
     Okay. You don't have to though.

Karl picks up two sacks and they walk away.

EXT. STREET - DAY

They walk in silence for a while before the boy finally
speaks.

               BOY
     My name is Frank Wheatley. What's
     your name?

               KARL
     Karl's my name.

               FRANK (BOY)
     What's you last name?

               KARL
     Childers.

               FRANK
     What are all them books?

               KARL
     Different ones. One's the Bible.
     One of 'ems a book on Christmas.
     One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.

               FRANK
     How come you're carryin' them
     around with you.

               KARL
     Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.

               FRANK
     Don't you live somewhere?

               KARL
     I did live there in the state
     hospital.

               FRANK
     Why'd you live there?

               KARL
     I killed some folks quite awhile
     back. They said I wadn't right in
     the head and they put me in there
     in the nervous hospital instead of
     puttin' me in jail.

               FRANK
     They let you out?

               KARL
     Yeah.

               FRANK
     How come?

               KARL
     They told me I was well. They had
     to turn me loose.

               FRANK
     Are you well?

               KARL
     I reckon I feel all right.

               FRANK
     You don't seem like you'd kill
     nobody.

They reach a little white frame house and the boy turns up
the sidewalk.

               FRANK (CONT'D)
     This is my house. You can just set
     those bags on the porch.

Karl sets the bags down and he and the boy stare at each
other in silence for a moment.

               FRANK (CONT'D)
     Do you like to play football?

               KARL
     I never was much count at it. I
     never did get picked out fer it.

               FRANK
     Me and the Burnett twins and some
     boys plays down at the junior high
     practice field all the time. If you
     ever want to come by and play. We
     ain't no good either. Well, I'll
     see you later.

He goes inside leaving Karl staring at the front door.

INT. BUS STATION - DAY

Karl stands at the counter. A middle-aged man is selling
tickets.

               KARL
     How does a feller go about gettin'
     up to the state hospital?

               MAN
     You buy a ticket for fourteen
     dollars and then set and wait for
     the four-fifteen bus to Kelton.

               KARL
     All right then.

INT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY

Karl walks down the hallway carrying his books. A couple
staffers give him 'Why are you still here' looks. He reaches
a door and goes in.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

There is no one at the desk in the outer office, so Karl goes
into Woolridge's office.

INT. WOOLRIDGE'S OFFICE - DAY

Karl finds Woolridge doing paper work. Woolridge looks up
startled.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Karl, what in the world are you
     doing here?

               KARL
     I want to come back and stay here.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Well, you can't do that. You're a
     free man. You've been let out to do
     as you please.

               KARL
     I reckon I don't care nothin' about
     bein' a free man. I don't know how
     to go about it.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Well, you have to learn. It'll take
     some time. Don't you know anybody
     down there to help you out?

               KARL
     Naw.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Your daddy's still livin' down
     there from what you told me.
          (pause)
     I guess he wouldn't help you any,
     would he? I wasn't thinking. You
     don't know anybody?

               KARL
     Naw. Never did know too much of
     nobody. Not to he'p me out anyway.

               WOOLRIDGE
          (sighs)
     Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't
     know where they expect you to go or
     what they expect you to do. If it
     was up to me, I'd let you stay here
     if that's what you wanted. I'm just
     doin' my job.
          (they sit in silence for a
           moment)
     You follow me?
          (no answer)
     Listen, I know an old boy that runs
     a fix-it shop deal down in
     Millsburg. He used to go to church
     with me. You're good workin' on
     small engines and things. If I put
     my neck out for you with him, will
     you work at it if he'll hire you?

               KARL
     I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn
     mowers and whatnot.

               WOOLRIDGE
     I know, I've seen it myself. Would
     you give that a try?

               KARL
     I reckon.

               WOOLRIDGE
     I can't promise he'll hire you.
     I'll have to tell him about your
     history.

               KARL
     I never was no good with history.

               WOOLRIDGE
     No, I mean your past. About why you
     were in here.
          (pause)
     I'll take you first thing in the
     mornin'. You have anyplace you can
     stay tonight at all?
     I just can't let you stay here.
     It's the rules. If something
     happened well, I'd be liable.

               KARL
     I reckon I can just walk around
     till the mornin'. Or set and read
     me a book somewhere.

They sit and stare at each other for a moment.

INT. WOOLRIDGE DEN - NIGHT

Woolridge, his WIFE, his teenage SON, BUBBA, and teenage
DAUGHTER sit in various comfortable chairs looking extremely
uncomfortable and staring at Karl, who is sitting on the edge
of a chair looking at the floor. After a long creepy moment,
Mom speaks.

               MRS. WOOLRIDGE
     Karl, would you like a muffin?

               KARL
     No thank ye.

               MRS. WOOLRIDGE
     I understand Jerry is going to take
     you somewhere else tomorrow.

               KARL
     I don't reckon I know nobody name
     Jerry.

               WOOLRIDGE
     She's talkin' about me, Karl.
     That's my first name.

               KARL
     He's a-carryin' me to look fer work
     in Millsburg where I was borned.

               MRS. WOOLRIDGE
     Would you like some coffee?

               KARL
     Coffee makes me a might nervous
     when I drink it.

               DAUGHTER
     Daddy, can I be excused to go to
     bed?

               WOOLRIDGE
     Sure, honey. You sleep with Mama
     tonight. I'll sleep with your
     brother and Karl can take your
     room.

               DAUGHTER
     Why?

               WOOLRIDGE
     We have company. Now you go on.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's an all-American girls room. Everything is pink. There
are stuffed animals everywhere and posters of pop idols.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Well, Karl, there's plenty of
     blankets and things there.
     Bathroom's right there in the hall.
     We'll leave first thing tomorrow.

Karl stands in the middle of the room holding his books.
Woolridge closes the door.

INT. WOOLRIDGE KITCHEN - NIGHT

Woolridge walks into the kitchen where Mom and Son sit at the
table.

               MRS. WOOLRIDGE
     Jerry, why didn't you give him
     Bubba's room? Sister's is kind of
     girly, isn't it?

               WOOLRIDGE
     Yeah, I thought about that. No
     sense in moving him now I guess.

               BUBBA
     Daddy, don't you think one of us
     ought to stay up all night and kind
     of - guard or somethin'?

               WOOLRIDGE
     Why, hell no, son. What's wrong
     with you?

               BUBBA
     Well, he's crazy. He's a nut ain't
     he?

               MRS. WOOLRIDGE
     'Isn't' he, Bubba. Don't say ain't.

INT. WOOLRIDGE DEN AND HALLWAY - MORNING

Woolridge, already dressed, walks through the den and down
the hallway. He knocks on the bedroom door.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Karl, you up?

               KARL (O.S.)
     Yes sir.

Woolridge opens the bedroom door and sees Karl sitting on the
edge of the bed beside his books. The light is on, the bed
still as it was the night before.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Didn't you go to sleep at all,
     Karl? You been sittin' there like
     that all night?

               KARL
     Yes sir.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Well, I guess we better hit the
     road.

INT. FIXIT SHOP - DAY

Woolridge's car pulls into the parking lot. He and Karl get
out and walk toward the shop.

INT. FIXIT SHOP - DAY

Two men, BILL COX, a large man in his forties, and SCOOTER
HODGES, a really country-looking guy in his thirties, look up
from behind the counter as Woolridge and Karl enter.
Woolridge goes to the counter, Karl stands by the door
looking at the floor.

               BILL
     Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to
     see you. Been a long time.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Good to see you, Bill. How's
     everybody doin'?

               BILL
     Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin'
     me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put
     me in the poorhouse. Can't complain
     other than that. Wouldn't do any
     good if I did.
          (laughs)
     Do you know Scooter, Jerry?

               WOOLRIDGE
     No, don't guess I do.
          (he shakes hands with
           Scooter who sort of
           smiles)
     Scooter, good to meet you.
          (Woolridge leans in and
           gets confidential)
     This is him, the one I talked to
     you about on the phone. Now like I
     said, I'll understand if you get
     nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie
     to you now, he did get in that
     trouble but then he was real young.

               BILL
     I remember it real well. Cut them
     folks to pieces. His mama one of
     'em.

               SCOOTER
     And that ol' Dixon boy. Hell, I
     always wanted to kill him myself.
     Asshole's what he was. I remember
     that ol' boy
          (points to Karl)
     too. Kind of retarded or somethin'
     back in school.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Well, he seems pretty well-adjusted
     these days. I don't think he'd ever
     hurt anybody.

               BILL
     Don't look much like he could. You
     say he can fix a small engine like
     nobody's bidness.

               WOOLRIDGE
     He's a regular whiz at it. That's
     all he did when he was a kid.

               BILL
     Well, I ain't scared of him workin'
     here. You know me. I'm a church
     goin' man. Forgivin' man. When your
     time's up the Lord's gonna come git
     you. You seared of him, Scooter?

               SCOOTER
     I don't guess. Can he talk?

               WOOLRIDGE
     Oh yeah. Listen I really appreciate
     it. He needs the job. I don't know
     what to do with him. He don't have
     anybody really.

               BILL
     That old man of his still livin'
     over there on Clark Street I
     believe.

               WOOLRIDGE
     He won't have anything to do with
     him. Now you say it's all right for
     him to stay out here in the back?

               BILL
     Fine with me. If he steals
     anything, I'll take it out of your
     pocket anyway.

Bill slaps Woolridge on the shoulders and wheezes with
laughter.

               WOOLRIDGE
     He won't steal. I'm tellin' you
     he's a pretty good ol' boy. Keeps
     to himself.

               BILL
     Well, I've got a roomful of work
     for him to do. Can't get Scooter to
     do any of it.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Karl, come over here. I want you to
     meet your new boss.
          (Karl obediently shuffles
           over)
     This is Bill Cox, runs this place.
     Says you can work here and stay in
     the back.

               BILL
     Good to know you, Karl.

               KARL
     Thank ye.

               BILL
     Now it's minimal wage and there
     ain't nothin' but a army cot and a
     toilet back there.

Karl doesn't say anything.

               WOOLRIDGE
     That'll be fine. Karl, I'll go to
     the car and get your books.

Woolridge exits. Bill and Scooter just stare at Karl and Karl
stares at the floor.

               BILL
     They say you're a whiz on fixin'
     lawn mowers and things.

               KARL
     I've tinkered around on 'em a
     little bit.

               BILL
     We order from Dairy Queen at
     noontime usually. We can buy your
     lunch till you get on your feet a
     little.

               KARL
     I like them french-fried potaters.

               BILL
          (long pause)
     Yeah, me too.

               SCOOTER
     They make a good double meat
     burger.

INT. SHOP WORKROOM - NIGHT

The place is cluttered with mowers, edgers, weed-eaters, and
other equipment, most of it in pieces. A small cot is in a
little clearing in the corner by the bathroom. Karl is
sweeping up oil with sawdust and a push broom while Scooter
puts some tools away. Bill comes to the door.

               BILL
     All right then, I'll see y'all
     later. Karl you done a good day's
     work. They right about you.
     Scooter, he's gonna knock you out
     of a job if you're not careful.
     I'll see you tomorrow.

               SCOOTER
     Wait up, I'll leave with you and
     lock up.

               BILL
     Karl, they's a blanket up in under
     that cot and soap in the bathroom
     to clean up with.
          (pause)
     Now there's one more thing. The way
     we lock these doors at night, you
     can't get out. You didn't want to
     go anywhere, did you?

               KARL
     I don't reckon.

               BILL
     If it works out and all, maybe
     we'll get you a key so you can get
     out at night if you need to. See
     you later.

They leave Karl standing in the midst of the lawn mowers. He
sets the broom down and goes and sits on the cot. After a
moment, he gets back up and starts sweeping again.

INT. SHOP - DAY

It's lunch time and Bill, Scooter, and Karl are sitting in
folding chairs behind the counter eating from their Dairy
Queen to-go bags. Karl has french fries.

               BILL
     Scooter, did I tell about the two
     old boys pissin' off the bridge?

               SCOOTER
     I can't remember.

               BILL
     There was these two old boys hung
     their peckers off of a bridge to
     piss, one old boy from California
     and one old boy from Arkansas.
     Old boy from California says, "Boy
     this water's cold." Old boy from
     Arkansas says "Yeah, and it's deep
     too."
          (starts wheezing)
     Get it? That's a goodun.

               SCOOTER
          (laughing)
     Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe
     you did tell me that one before.
     I've heard that a bunch. Long time
     ago.

               BILL
     Well, yeah it's a classic. You
     know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about
     it last night and it's just not
     Christian of me to not let you have
     a key. I mean you been in lockup so
     long, you don't need me keepin' you
     locked up. You need to come and go
     as you please. Here, take this key,
     it'll get you in and out that back
     door.
          (Karl takes the key and
           keeps eating french
           fries)
     Them french fries good?

               KARL
     Yeah, they's good all right.

               BILL
     You got any money?

               KARL
     They give me fifty dollars when
     they turned me loose. I spent up
     some of it on ridin' the bus and
     eatin' french-fried potaters.

               BILL
     Well, I'm gonna pay you today for
     this comin' week, so you'll have
     some walkin' around money. When you
     get off this evenin' you better go
     buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up
     supplies to have back there. Some
     hard candy and some magazines.
     Somethin' to keep you busy at
     night.

               KARL
     All right then.

               BILL
     I'll let you off while it's still
     daylight.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Karl is walking down a residential street. He stops in front
of the house where the boy, Frank, lives and stares at the
house for a moment, then he walks up to the door and stares
at it. A curtain moves and the boy's face appears at the
window. He comes and opens the door.

               FRANK
     Hey there. I thought I heard
     somebody on the porch. Wasn't your
     name Karl?

               KARL
     Yeah it is. Your name's Frank.

               FRANK
     Yeah. What you doin' by here?

               KARL
     You told me to come by.

               FRANK
     Did you want to play ball with us?

               KARL
     I ain't no good at it. I just come
     by.

               FRANK
     Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to
     go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar
     Store. She's workin' two till
     eight.

               KARL
     All right then.

He starts to walk away.

               FRANK
     Wait a minute. You want to go with
     me? You can meet my mama.

               KARL
     I don't want to worry your mama
     with company.

               FRANK
     Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's
     real nice. She'll give us somethin'
     if we ask her to. Candy or
     somethin'.

               KARL
     I was kindly needin' to do some
     tradin'. Reckon they sell
     toothpaste?

               FRANK
     They sell some of everything. Come
     on let's go. I won't tell her about
     you bein' in the state hospital for
     killin'.

INT. BEN'S DOLLAR STORE - DAY

Frank and Karl make their way through the fairly crowded
store. It's sort of a mini-version of a Walmart. They find
Frank's mother in her red smock talking to a guy in a red
Ben's knit shirt. They are laughing together and pricing some
mouthwash. LINDA WHEATLEY is a short, plain woman in her
thirties. The man, VAUGHAN CUNNINGHAM, is in his forties,
with a neat flattop hair cut, glasses, and a paunch hanging
over his belt. They eye Karl suspiciously, as the boys
approach.

               FRANK
     Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.

               LINDA
     Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?

               VAUGHAN
     Let me guess. You want a bunch of
     candy and a pop.

               FRANK
     Yeah.

               VAUGHAN
     You're gonna rot your teeth that
     way. But I bet I know what you
     would like even better.
     I put potted meat on special, four
     cans for a dollar and they're not
     moving very well. I'd sure let a
     few cans go for free to the right
     boy.

               FRANK
     I don't like potted meat. Daddy
     used to say it was made out of lips
     and peckers and intestints.

               LINDA
     Frank, don't talk that way. Who's
     that strange lookin' man behind
     you? Did he follow you in here?

               VAUGHAN
     Can I help you, sir?

               FRANK
     Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the
     laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama.
     And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager.
     He lets mama off any time she feels
     like it 'cause they're best
     friends.

               LINDA
     Nice to meet you, Karl.

               KARL
          (keeping his distance)
     Pleased to know y'all.

There's an uncomfortable silence.

               LINDA
     Frank come back here with me for a
     minute.

She shuffles him away and leaves Vaughan staring at Karl.

               VAUGHAN
     I don't think I've ever seen you
     before.

               KARL
     Naw, I don't believe you have. I
     don't reckon I never been in here.
     This store didn't used to be here.

               VAUGHAN
     It's been here seventeen years. Did
     you live here before or something?

               KARL
     I's horned and raised here up till
     I's twelve year old.

               VAUGHAN
     What brings you back?

               KARL
     What's that you say?

               VAUGHAN
     Why are you here now?

               KARL
     They turned me loose from the state
     hospital.

               VAUGHAN
     Is that right?
          (pause)
     Are you going to be staying here
     long?

               KARL
     I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired
     on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.

               VAUGHAN
     Do you have family here?

               KARL
     Not really to speak of.

Linda and Frank return from the back.

               FRANK
     Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you
     can stay with us. Out in the
     garage. Our car won't fit in there
     anyway. It's real neat.

               LINDA
     Frank told me about your situation.
     And Frank loves company. You know,
     especially after his daddy passed
     and all. There ain't no sense in
     you stayin' in that old greasy
     shop.
          (to Vaughan, hushed)
     He's mentally retarded, poor thing.

               VAUGHAN
          (hushed)
     He just got out of the state
     hospital.

               LINDA
          (put out)
     I know.

               FRANK
     Can we get some candy and pops?

               VAUGHAN
     Sure, go ahead.

They walk off down the aisle leaving Vaughan a little
puzzled.

               VAUGHAN (CONT'D)
     Are you sure it's safe to let him
     around that guy?

               LINDA
     Frank's just crazy about him. He
     likes the way he talks. He helped
     him carry home the clean laundry.

               VAUGHAN
     He's been in the state hospital a
     long time, something must be wrong
     with him.

               LINDA
     He's retarded's all. You know he's
     always after a father figure and
     Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one
     with his mean ass.

               VAUGHAN
     What about me?

               LINDA
     I don't think he sees you as a guy
     guy.

               VAUGHAN
          (wrinkles his brow)
     Karl is a guy guy?

EXT. WOODED AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

Karl and Frank sit on stumps in a little clearing enjoying
the spoils of their Ben's Dollar Store visit.

               FRANK
     This is what I call my secret place
     'cause I come out here when I feel
     like bein' by myself. I used to
     come here with Karen Cross. She's
     kind of like my girlfriend, or used
     to be. She says she likes Jerry
     Maroney now. But I'm gonna get her
     back 'cause I love her. We used to
     come here and hold hands and talk
     and read books to each other with a
     flashlight. She didn't want to have
     anything to do with me in front of
     other people 'cause I don't have
     any money. Well, mama and me, I
     mean. She seemed to like me a whole
     lot when we were out here though.
     She said she loved me, too. Out
     here. Settin' right on that stump
     you're on. See, her daddy's a
     dentist so they're rich. So's Jerry
     Maroney's daddy. He owns the ice
     plant. Was your folks well off?

               KARL
     Naw. Didn't have too much. Enough
     to scrape by on, I reckon.

               FRANK
     They still around, your folks?

               KARL
     My mother's dead. My daddy's
     s'posed to be around still. He
     don't want to have nothin' to do
     with me though.

               FRANK
     How do you know?

               KARL
     He never did want to. I figure he
     ain't changed his mind much.

               FRANK
     How did your mama die?

               KARL
          (long pause)
     You don't need to know all of that.
     You're just a boy.
     You need to think about good
     thoughts while you're still a boy.
     They'll be plenty of time for the
     other.

               FRANK
     I've had a lot of bad thoughts
     since my daddy died. Sometimes I
     wish I was still real little and he
     was still here. My mama's real
     good, but I wish I had both of 'em.
          (pause)
     When we went to Memphis one time in
     the car, it was rainin' so hard we
     couldn't see the road. But I wadn't
     scared because I thought as long as
     daddy was drivin' nothin' could
     happen to us. I feel that way about
     mama now.
          (he looks at the ground
           for a moment)
     Mama has a boyfriend now. His name
     is Doyle Hargraves. He works
     construction so he makes a pretty
     good livin'. He still don't help
     mama out with any money though. He
     ain't no good. He's mean to her. He
     don't like me at all. Mama says
     it's because he's jealous I belong
     to my daddy instead of him. He
     stays with us all night sometimes,
     but he's got his own house.
     Somebody told me it's so he can
     still have other girlfriends. I
     like it on the nights when he ain't
     at our house. I'm not so nervous
     then.

               KARL
     How come her to keep bein'
     girlfriends and all with him if
     he's mean to her?

               FRANK
     She says it's for the times when
     he's good to her. She's lonely
     since daddy died. She said
     sometimes she don't know why.
          (pause)
     He threatened to kill her if she
     ever left him. My daddy would kill
     him if he was here and somebody was
     mean to mama. Vaughan, he's real
     good to mama. Vaughan that you met.
     But he's not able to do anything to
     Doyle, he's funny you know. Not
     funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes
     to go with men instead of women.
     That makes him not to be able to
     fight too good. He sure is nice
     though. He's from St. Louis. People
     who are queer can get along better
     in a big town. He got transferred
     here to work. But mama said the
     real reason he left is 'cause his
     daddy hated him. For bein' the way
     he is. I wish he liked to go with
     women. I'd rather him be mama's
     boyfriend than Doyle.

Pause as Frank looks at the ground again. He seems troubled.

               FRANK (CONT'D)
     Karl.
          (pause)
     You know when I said daddy got hit
     by a train.

               KARL
     Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me
     that.

               FRANK
     It ain't the truth. He shot hisself
     with a shotgun on purpose.

               KARL
     Why did he do that, reckon.

               FRANK
     'Cause he didn't have enough money
     to take care of us the way he
     wanted to. That's what the letter
     said. He got laid off from work and
     had to just work odd jobs. I
     thought he took care of us fine.
          (pause)
     Karl, did you really kill somebody?

               KARL
     Yeah, I did.

               FRANK
     Who did you kill?

               KARL
     Two people.

               FRANK
     Were they bad people?

               KARL
     I thought they was.

               FRANK
     Maybe they needed it.

               KARL
     I growed up and got taught it ain't
     right to kill nobody.

               FRANK
     It's okay if you're lookin' out for
     yourself. If it's self-defense. Was
     it self-defense?

Karl shifts around and makes a noise in his throat and
doesn't answer.

               FRANK (CONT'D)
     My daddy was good. I think too many
     good people die. It ain't right.
     That's what I think.

INT. SHOP - DAY

Karl is tying the strap around his books. His sack of
toiletries is on the bed. Bill Cox comes in.

               BILL
     Now, Karl, you sure you want to go
     stay with these folks? You're
     welcome to keep on stayin here.
     It's workin' out real good.

               KARL
     That boy wants me to.

               BILL
     All right then. I'll see you bright
     and early. How you comin' along on
     that garden tiller?

               KARL
     I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty
     good.

               BILL
     You done fixed it? I'll be damned.
     Scooter told me it couldn't be
     fixed.
     'Course Scooter's about as shitless
     as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be.
     You done fixed it. I'll just be
     damned. See you tomorrow.

INT. WHEATLEY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

DOYLE is in the comfortable easy chair with adjuster handle
drinking beer. He's in his late thirties and dressed in his
construction clothes. Linda sits on the arm of the chair and
Frank stands before them.

               DOYLE
     Well, honey, I don't guess I give a
     shit. I ain't here half the time
     anyway. If you want a retard livin'
     in the garage, I don't guess I
     care. I've got a good tool box and
     socket set out there I don't want
     stol'd. I guess I could take it
     home with me.

               FRANK
     He's real honest. He wouldn't steal
     nothin'.

               DOYLE
     Now son, I wadn't talkin' to you,
     was I?
          (pause)
     Was I?

               FRANK
     No sir.

               DOYLE
     No sir's right. I'm talkin' to your
     mama. This is your mama's decision,
     not yours. I'm lettin' it go on
     because she asked me, not you.
          (to Linda)
     Now is this the kind of retard that
     drools and rubs shit in his hair
     and all that, 'cause I have trouble
     eatin' around that kind of thing.
     Just like I am about antique
     furniture and midgets. I can't so
     much as drink a glass of water
     around a midget or a piece of
     antique furniture. Same thing with
     a droolin' retard.

               LINDA
     Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't
     be that way.

               DOYLE
     I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just
     tellin' the truth. What was he in
     the nuthouse for?

               LINDA
     He's just mentally retarded, I
     guess.

               DOYLE
     He had of went nuts and did
     somethin'. They don't put you in
     there for just bein' a retard.
     They's retards all over the place
     that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you
     know, Frank?

               FRANK
     I ain't sure.

               DOYLE
     You might want to find out. He
     might of hacked his family to
     pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.

               LINDA
     Yeah, that's right, Frank, you
     better ask him. I mean, don't hurt
     his feelin's or anything, but it
     would be good to know. I'm sure
     it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.

               DOYLE
     You sure are hung up on people
     bein' sweet.
          (takes a long pull on his
           beer)
     Speakin' of which, where's your
     girlfriend? I thought he was comin'
     by here for something.

               LINDA
     He'll be here in a little while,
     he's takin' me to get an ice cream.

               DOYLE
     Ain't that the sweetest thing. What
     am I supposed to do about supper
     with you traipsin' around with that
     fag?

               LINDA
     You're not crippled. Get in there
     and make somethin'.

               DOYLE
     Boy, ain't you somethin' else.
     Talkin' back and everything. It
     kinda makes me horny when you talk
     back.

               LINDA
     Frank, why don't you go off and
     play in your room if Doyle's gonna
     talk nasty.

               FRANK
     I want to watch T.V.

               DOYLE
     Yeah, honey, let the kid watch T.V.
     Hell, let's all watch T.V. like a
     family till your retarded friend
     and your homosexual friend gets
     here.

EXT. PORCH - NIGHT

Karl is standing on the porch with his bag and his books
staring at the door. After a moment, we hear a car door slam
and footsteps on the porch. Then we hear Vaughan's voice.

               VAUGHAN
     Karl?

Karl turns to face Vaughan.

               KARL
     Yes sir.

               VAUGHAN
     So, you're really going to stay
     here?

               KARL
     That boy wants me to.

               VAUGHAN
     Did you knock on the door yet?

               KARL
     Naw, I ain't.

               VAUGHAN
     How long have you been standing
     here?

               KARL
     Quite a spell, I reckon.

               VAUGHAN
     Listen, before you get very used to
     staying here, I think you and I
     need to talk about a few things.
     Can I take you to lunch?

               KARL
     I done et just a little bit ago.

               VAUGHAN
     I mean tomorrow or the next day.

               KARL
     I reckon I can stand to eat a
     little somethin' or 'nother at
     noontime tomorrow. Bill Cox
     generally gets me a box of french
     fried potaters. But I reckon he can
     lay off doin' it tomorrow.

               VAUGHAN
     Okay, I'll come by Mr. Cox's and
     get you at noon.

They stand therefor a moment. Vaughan doesn't really know
exactly what else to do, so he knocks on the door. After a
moment, Frank answers the door.

               FRANK
     Hey. Y'all come on in.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Vaughan ushers Karl in and they stand behind the sofa. Doyle
looks up and grins.

               LINDA
     Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?

               KARL
     Tolerable, I reckon.

               LINDA
          (in a hurry to get out)
     Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle.
     Frank, why don't you and Karl go
     out in the garage and fix him up a
     place or play a game or somethin'.
     Vaughan, you ready to go?

               VAUGHAN
     Sure, I guess.

               DOYLE
     Don't rush ever'body, honey.

She starts to get her things together.

               LINDA
          (to Frank)
     Maybe you and Karl want to go with
     us?

               FRANK
     Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl
     got things we need to do.

               DOYLE
     Hey, Vaughan, you know what I
     heard? I heard you been puttin' it
     to Albert Sellers that works over
     at the funeral home.

               VAUGHAN
     I know Albert. We're friends.

               DOYLE
     I heard you was more than friends.
     I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all
     all bowed up and goin' at it in the
     same room with poor, little, old
     Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a
     doornail layed out on a gurney.

               VAUGHAN
     That's ridiculous. That's just a
     total lie.

               LINDA
     Let's go, Vaughan.
          (they start for the door)
     Frank, we'll be back in a little
     while. I'll bring you back
     somethin'. You're food's in the
     oven warmin' over.

               DOYLE
     See, you made him somethin'. Hey
     Vaughan, I was just goin' on with
     you, jokin' around, buddy.

               VAUGHAN
          (smiles a little)
     Yeah, I knew that. You're a card
     all right.

Linda kisses Frank on the forehead and they leave.

               DOYLE
     So, Karl, come have a seat, talk to
     me.

Karl sits on the couch.

               FRANK
     Come on, Karl, let's go out to the
     garage.

               DOYLE
     Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man.
     You set right there, Karl.

Frank leans on the sofa arm beside Karl.

               DOYLE (CONT'D)
     What's in your bag?

               KARL
     This and that. Toothpaste and
     whatnot.

               DOYLE
     What's all them books?

               KARL
     Different ones. The Bible's one of
     'em.

               DOYLE
     You believe in the Bible?

               KARL
     A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't
     understand all of it.

               DOYLE
     Well, I can't understand none of
     it. This one begat this one and
     that one begat this one and begat
     and begat and begat and lo somebody
     sayeth some shit or another. Just
     how retarded are you?

               FRANK
     Stop it, Doyle!

               DOYLE
     You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'.
     The adults are talkin'. Were you in
     the lockup for cuttin' somebody up
     with a hatchet?

               KARL
     I ain't never used no hatchet that
     I remember.

               DOYLE
     You're just crazy in a retarded
     kind of way then.
          (pause)
     It wouldn't matter to me if you did
     do violence on somebody 'cause I
     ain't afraid of shit. You think I'm
     afraid for you to stay here. You're
     just a humped over retard it looks
     like to me. Not really, I'm just
     jokin' with you. Welcome to our
     humble home, buddy. Frank needs all
     the friends he can get. Frank's a
     real weak little kid. His daddy
     taught him how to be a pussy.

               FRANK
     Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about
     daddy, you hear me!

               DOYLE
          (mocking)
     Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on
     to the garage and let me be.

Frank is crying now.

               FRANK
     Come on, Karl.

They get up and walk away.

               DOYLE
          (yelling to Frank)
     Don't tell your mama we had a
     little spat. She don't need to be
     worried with your ass.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Karl sits on an old sofa and Frank sits on an upside down
paint bucket, still upset.

               FRANK
     I'd like to kill that son of a
     bitch. I hate him.

               KARL
     You ort not to talk that way.
     You're just a boy.

               FRANK
     Well, I hate him.

               KARL
     He ort not to talk that away to you
     neither. He ain't no count. He's
     mean to you and your mama.
          (pause)
     Yore mama and that feller that's
     carryin' me to get somethin'
     d'eat's gonna be back here
     directly.

               FRANK
     Will you stay here with us for a
     long time?

               KARL
     I reckon if you want me to.
          (pause)
     I got some of that potted meat and
     sodie crackers left over if you
     want some.

               FRANK
     I don't see how you can eat that
     stuff with all those insides it's
     made out of.

               KARL
     I reckon it tastes pretty good to
     me.

               FRANK
     I like the way you talk.

               KARL
     I like the way you talk.

Karl starts to put together a cracker and potted meat delight
as we:

                              DISSOLVE TO:

INT. HAMBURGER ESTABLISHMENT - DAY

Vaughan is carrying a tray of food as Karl follows him to a
table and they sit and immediately start to eat. After a few
bites, Vaughan starts to speak in an official manner.

               VAUGHAN
     Okay, Karl, the reason I brought
     you here was to talk to you about
     something that is on my mind.
          (pauses for a response,
           instead Karl eats french
           fries and stares at the
           table)
     I guess I'll put it right out on
     the table. Where do I start. Linda
     and Frank are very important to me.
     They're like family. My own family
     was never like family. They're
     horrible people. As a matter of
     fact I prayed every night for years
     that my father would die. I finally
     realized through a lot of therapy
     that I was wasting my energy on
     hating him. Now I just don't care.
          (pause)
     You see, you and I are a lot alike,
     strange as that may seem. I mean
     not physically or even mentally
     really, just well, maybe
     emotionally or actually the hand
     we've been dealt in life. We're
     different. People see us as being
     different anyway. You're -- well
     you have your affliction or
     whatever and I, well mine's not as
     easy to see. I'm just going to say
     it. I'm gay.
          (watts)
     Does that surprise you?
          (watts)
     That I'm gay. You know what being
     gay is, don't you?

               KARL
     I reckon not.

               VAUGHAN
     Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.

               KARL
     Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.

               VAUGHAN
     Well that's a very offensive way to
     put it. You shouldn't say that. You
     were taught that, weren't you?

               KARL
     I've heard it said that way.

               VAUGHAN
     Anyway, it's hard to live gay,
     that's the right way to say it, in
     a small town like this. I've wanted
     to leave many times, but my love
     for Linda and Frank and another
     certain person that we won't go
     into have kept me from it. Anyway,
     I'm rambling. If you're going to
     live in the Wheatly garage you need
     to know that it won't be easy.
     Doyle is a monster. Not just a
     closed minded redneck, but a
     monster. A dangerous person. I've
     told Linda that one day that man is
     going to really hurt her or that
     boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I
     see it in his eyes. I'm very in
     tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle
     will make your life hell. You're a
     perfect target. When I first saw
     you I was afraid of you. Not really
     afraid, I guess, just taken aback.
     But also, I felt a real sensitive
     feeling from you. And for some
     reason, Frank has adopted you. Much
     like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I
     didn't mean it like that. In a good
     way. Anyway, I just want you to
     know what you're in for. I have a
     good feeling about you. You're good
     for Frank. Maybe it's that he can
     have an adult friend on a child's
     level.
     I'm sorry, I didn't mean it in a
     bad way.
          (pause)
     There's one more thing. It's none
     of my business why you were in the
     state hospital. Everyone has
     something in their past, maybe you
     tried suicide, maybe you did
     something -- terrible. But what I
     see before me is a gentle, simple
     man. All I want you to promise me
     is that you're capable of being
     around Linda and Frank. You know.
     You would never hurt them under any
     circumstances, would you?

               KARL
     I wouldn't never hurt them.

               VAUGHAN
     That's what I thought. I hope I
     haven't offended you in any way.
     You seem like a thinker. You seem
     to always be in deep thought. Tell
     me something. What are you thinking
     right now?

Karl looks up and stares for a moment.

               KARL
     I was thinkin' I could use me
     another helpin' of these potaters.

               VAUGHAN
     Oh. How about before that?

               KARL
     Before that I was thinkin' it'd be
     good if I could get another three
     or four cans of that potted meat if
     you got any extry.

INT. WHEATLEY KITCHEN - NIGHT

Linda, Frank, and Doyle are eating.

               LINDA
     How come Karl won't eat here with
     us?

               FRANK
     I don't know. He just said he'd eat
     out there.

               DOYLE
     Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.

               LINDA
     I just feel sorry for the poor
     thing.

               DOYLE
     Who could eat with him settin'
     there makin' that goddamn racket
     with his throat.

               LINDA
     He does make some funny noises.

               FRANK
     I sure like the way he talks. It
     sounds like a race car motor
     idlin'. It makes me not be nervous.

               LINDA
     I'm glad of it, honey.

               DOYLE
     What have you got to be nervous
     about? You're a damn kid. You ain't
     got any bills to pay or bidness to
     run or old lady to stay on your ass
     all the time.

               FRANK
     I get nervous, that's all I know.

They eat in silence for a while. Linda and Frank know where
this conversation could lead and know when to leave well
enough alone.

               DOYLE
     You know what, by God?

               LINDA
     What?

               DOYLE
     You know what we ought to do
     tonight?

               LINDA
     Please Doyle, don't.

               DOYLE
     Have a damn party! Call Morris and
     them and get the band together and
     just party our asses off. I'd like
     to show that fuckin' Karl to the
     guys. They'd get a kick out of
     that. Don't you know they would.

               LINDA
     Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not
     up for it. They always stay till
     mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.

               DOYLE
     You don't have to do anything but
     pour some potato chips in a bowl
     and bring beers out when we get
     low.

               FRANK
     Last time you got mad and run
     Morris and them off and said to
     stay away from here.

               DOYLE
     That ain't none of your damn
     bidness. Besides that's the way
     friends do one another. Fuck it,
     I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find
     my guitar, I think it's out there
     in the garage with that loony tune.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Karl sits on his cot eating from the plate Frank brought him.
Frank and Linda come through the door. Frank comes and sits
beside Karl. Linda gets a guitar case down from a shelf and
comes over and stands in front of Karl.

               LINDA
     Karl, now listen, there's gonna be
     a party tonight here at the house.
     Doyle's invited his music-playin'
     buddies over to make a bunch of
     racket out on the patio.

               FRANK
     They ain't even no good. The only
     one can play is Randy
     Horsefeathers. He claims he's an
     Indian. His real name's Randy
     Collins and he works at the feed
     mill. He can at least play guitar.

               LINDA
     He's no more an Indian than I am
     though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try
     and tease you and be mean to you to
     show off to his friends. Just like
     he does to Frank and me sometimes.
     You just ignore it. Or stay out
     here away from 'em if he'll let
     you. He's an okay guy till he gets
     drunk but tonight he'll get drunk.
     I guarantee it.

               FRANK
     He ain't ever okay to me.

The garage door opens and Doyle appears. He seems really
happy.

               DOYLE
     Well, it's on! We're gonna rock.
     Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to
     get over here. I'd like him to be
     here. I owe him a good time.

               LINDA
     No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to
     come to a party with you.

               DOYLE
     Too late, Honey. Fooled you. Done
     called him. He'll be here.
          (grins)
     Or I'll go get him. Come on Karl, I
     need you to help me ice down a tub
     of beer, you and Frank.

INT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

White Christmas tree lights are strung above the patio. Karl
sits to the side in a kitchen chair staring at the ground
alongside Vaughan, Frank, and Linda. The "band" is set up on
the patio. The band consists of MORRIS, a heavyset guy in a
military uniform on tambourine, TERENCE, a skinny guy in a
wheelchair on bass, RANDY, a long haired younger guy who's
not an Indian on guitar, Doyle on a guitar which he can't
play and MONTY "The Johnson " Johnson, a large guy with a ZZ
Top beard on drums. A tub of beer is in front of them.
They're all hooting and hollering and drinking. They've
obviously been at it for a while. Doyle steps forward to
address the 'crowd.'

               DOYLE
     Okay ladies and gentlemen
          (points to Vaughan)
     or both. It's come to the time in
     our show when we like to introduce
     the band. Over here on lead guitar
     Mr. Randy Horsefeathers. Come on
     hit a hot lick, Randy.
          (Randy plays a lick)
     Well, come on, y'all are supposed
     to clap now. Come on!
          (they clap a little except
           for Karl)

ANGLE ON LINDA

               LINDA
     Karl, you better clap your hands or
     he'll just keep on.

Karl claps his hands a little.

               DOYLE
     On the bass, give it up for Terence
     "One Ball" Atkins.
          (more half-assed clapping)
     On the tambourine and lyrics Morris
     Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the
     group.
          (claps)
     On drums "The Johnson."
          (claps)
     And last and most importantly,
     Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar
     and business affairs and the only
     motherfucker with a truck big
     enough to haul this outfit on the
     next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a
     big hand for these guys. They're
     workin' their asses off here.
          (pauses for a slug of
           beer)
     Okay I'd like to dedicate this next
     one to some very special people in
     our audience tonight. To my lovely
     female companion Linda, her lovely
     son Frank, our new boarder Karl -
     what's your last name Karl?

               KARL
     Childers.

               DOYLE
     Karl Childers just in from the
     state facility. Make one of them
     gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it
     is you do.
          (nothing)
     Oh well, Karl's a little retarded,
     he don't know what the hell I'm
     talkin' about. And to Vaughan who
     fucks a mortician in the rear
     entrance right in front of his
     clients. Now that takes balls. Our
     number one tune for the folks,
     boys. Kick it off Johnson!

They play "Walk Don't Run" while the audience of four sits in
motionless silence. They finish the song and hoot and holler
and drink some more and say nasty things to each other.

               DOYLE (CONT'D)
     You like that Vaughan?

               VAUGHAN
     Sure. It sounded like a number one
     tune all right.

               DOYLE
     You enjoying yourself, Karl?

               KARL
     I reckon.

We hear the voice of an OLD MAN NEIGHBOR in the near
distance.

               VOICE (O.S.)
     I wished you all would lay off for
     tonight. I can't hear myself think
     for that racket. It's nighttime,
     now let folks be! I'll call the
     law!

               DOYLE
          (hollers back)
     I told you already three times, the
     laws on my side. I play cards with
     J.D. Shelnutt, chief' of police.
     Get fucked you old bastard!
          (to the party)
     Okay now, Linda, you and the kid
     clean up and get a tarpaulin over
     this instruments. Me and the boys
     are goin' to the county line.
     We're out of liquor and beer. Come
     on Karl, you and Vaughan are goin'
     with us.

               VAUGHAN
     I'd better go on home now, it's
     late. I have to work tomorrow.

               DOYLE
     Come on, don't be a pussy.
     Everybody has to work.

               LINDA
     He don't want to Doyle. Don't go
     Vaughan if you don't want to.
     You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.

               DOYLE
          (very sincere)
     But honey, I'll be good. I promise.
     I love you sweetie. I'm just tryin'
     to help these two be part of
     things.

INT. DOYLE'S TRUCK - NIGHT

Doyle is driving, Vaughan in the middle, and Karl by the
window. Doyle cranks up the truck and pops in a cassette
tape. The first few notes of "Ghost Riders in the Sky" play.

               VAUGHAN
     Are you sure you can drive? You've
     really had a lot of alcohol.

               DOYLE
     Shhhh! This is the national anthem.

They take off, tires screaming on the pavement as the song
goes louder.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The truck fishtails into the night and we see the rest of the
"band" in the back of the truck trying to control Terence's
wheelchair as it rolls back and forth.

INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

               DOYLE
          (points to tape player)
     Not that you afflicted sons of
     bitches would know anything about
     it, but this is art.

They are stopped by a red traffic light. A police car pulls
up beside them and Doyle looks over at the RED-FACED COP on
the passenger side and turns down the music.

               DOYLE (CONT'D)
     Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I
     seen your pitcher in the paper for
     catchin' that big-ass bass.

               FREDDY
     Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't
     drunk drivin' are you Doyle?

               DOYLE
     Yeah.

               FREDDY
     I figured that. Well you better be
     careful with that cripple in the
     back. You'll throw him out. Looks
     like you got a wagonful.

               DOYLE
     We run outta somethin' to drink.
     Goin' to the county line. You want
     to race?

               FREDDY
          (laughing)
     You know better than that. We're on
     duty. Catch me in that Camaro next
     week one night.

               DOYLE
     Catch you later Freddy!

Doyle peels out and the music blares again.

               DOYLE (CONT'D)
     I bet you like sittin' between two
     men in a dual wheel truck don't
     you?

               VAUGHAN
     Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.

               DOYLE
     Sarcastic right?
          (pause)
     You know the boys in the band are
     probably gonna stay over tonight.
     We'd be glad to have you.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Doyle slouches in his chair drinking whiskey from the bottle.
Terence and Morris are sitting facing Karl and Vaughan who
are on the sofa. Randy and The Johnson are sitting across the
room in straight-backed chairs drinking beer. They really
stocked up at the county line and beer and liquor bottles are
strewn everywhere. Morris is in the middle of a monologue,
which has obviously been going on for awhile.

               MORRIS
     Anyhow I'm not sure if you follow
     me on those particular points, but
     it's not really important in the
     smaller picture, which is where
     most people dwell anyway. Not that
     being manager of Ben's Dollar Store
     is insignificant. Or that making it
     through years of incarceration in a
     state supported facility is any
     small feat.

               THE JOHNSON
     Morris, he's the only one in the
     band that went to college.

               RANDY
     I'm in junior college right now
     over in Westfield.

               THE JOHNSON
     That ain't no college, that's trade
     school. Auto repair ain't ever made
     a genius out of nobody.

               MORRIS
     Holidays are for campers.

               RANDY
     What do you know about bein' a
     genius, Johnson. You can't even
     hardly keep a steady beat on that
     high-price drum set.

               TERENCE
     I think y'all play really tight
     together, Randy. Y'all shouldn't
     throw off on one another.

               MORRIS
     Anything that has to be discussed
     can't mean anything.

               DOYLE
     You got that shit right.

               VAUGHAN
     What exactly do you mean by that? I
     don't understand.

               MORRIS
     Exactly the point, my young
     levelheaded friend.

               VAUGHAN
     I don't get it.

               MORRIS
     I rest my case.

               TERENCE
     Morris is real smart with
     philosophies and things. That's why
     him and me are the songwriting team
     of our group. I make up good tunes
     or melodies as we call them and
     Morris is the lyrics.

               MORRIS
     Not unlike Gary Brooker of the
     Protocol Harum.

               RANDY
     We don't ever play any songs that
     y'all wrote. I never even heard one
     of 'em. Y'all just talk.

               THE JOHNSON
     We don't even play any songs with
     words at all that I remember. We
     ain't got no fuckin' microphone. Or
     speaker set up.

               TERENCE
     We wrote one last night standin'
     outside Mini-Mart. Morris called it
     "Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car."
     Then, you know, like on country
     songs in parenthesis it says "There
     is usually someone in the trunk." I
     came up with a tune just humming.

               DOYLE
     See Vaughan, you shouldn't question
     a genius. Morris is a modern day
     poet like in the old days.

               MORRIS
     Our latest composition is as
     follows: entitled:
     "The Thrill" --
     "I stand on the hill
     Not for a thrill
     but for a breath
     of a fresh kill
     Never mind the man
     who contemplates
     doing away with license plates
     He stands alone anyway
     Baking the cookies of discontent
     By the heat of a laundrymat vent
     Leaving his soul"
     (Then like in poetry I have dot dot
     dot then drop down to the next line
     kind of off center.)
     "Leaving his soul parting waters
     Under the medulla oblongata
     of (then dot dot dot again)
     mankind."

Silence for a moment as everyone in the room just stares at
something other than Morris.

               TERENCE
     I don't think that's right. I
     believe dot dot dot come between
     medulla and oblongata or something
     like that.
          (Morris stares at him)
     Well it did. It wadn't before
     mankind, I know that much.

               MORRIS
     The dots are where I say they are.
     Melody and tune. That's your trade.
     You're a tunesmith Terence.

               VAUGHAN
     I don't really understand the
     meaning of the words.

               DOYLE
     If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go
     out of my mind. And plus you're
     liable to bust a spring in Karl's
     head. He's already off balance.

               TERENCE
     That wadn't the way you made it up
     before, Morris. That's all I know.

               RANDY
     We don't need fancy words, we need
     to practice. We don't ever
     rehearse.

               THE JOHNSON
     We need some payin' gigs instead of
     just messin' around on first one
     patio and then another'n.

               RANDY
     Morris, you should just be the
     manager, you can't play nothin'
     anyway.

Doyle jumps up and throws his whiskey bottle through the
window. He has changed from groggy drunk to a wild-eyed
madman in a flash.

               DOYLE
     We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all
     just shut the fuck up! We don't
     need no practicin' or managers
     cause we ain't no fuckin' band!
     Morris ain't no genius and the rest
     of you are just losers. Am I the
     only one sane human bein' around
     here? Just get the hell out of my
     house and don't come back!

               VAUGHAN
     It's not your house, Doyle, it's
     Linda's.

               DOYLE
     I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot!
     You mind your own business. Now get
     out! Now, before I get too mad to
     turn back.

               TERENCE
     What about our instruments?

Doyle grabs the handles of Terence's wheelchair and pushes
him right out the screen door. We hear the chair clatter down
the steps and a cry of pain from Terence.

               DOYLE
     Now!

They all file out the door except Vaughan and Karl who sit
frozen on the sofa.

               THE JOHNSON
          (turning back)
     You ain't right Doyle. Somethin's
     wrong with you. Nobody needs your
     shit.

               MORRIS
          (stops at the door)
     The dots just look good on paper.
     You don't sing 'em anyway. You're
     showing your true Aries colors now.

               DOYLE
     Get out of my goddamn face, you
     fuckin' buzzard!

He slams the door and turns to see Vaughan and Karl on the
sofa and Linda and Frank, in their nightclothes, standing in
the doorway.

               DOYLE (CONT'D)
     I thought I told everybody to get
     out of my house. That includes
     cocksuckers and retards. Get off
     your asses and go.

               LINDA
     This is not your house, Doyle. This
     is my house and I'll say who stays
     and goes. You've got a house, why
     don't you go get one of your
     girlfriends and go home to it.

               DOYLE
     You know better than to talk like
     that when I'm hurtin'. Don't make
     me knock the piss out of you.

               VAUGHAN
     Doyle, don't you lay one hand on
     her.

               DOYLE
     That's funny.
          (to Linda)
     You go to bed and take snot nose
     with you.

Linda walks up to him with Frank close behind. Vaughan gets
up also. Karl stares at the floor rubbing his hands together.

               LINDA
     You're not stayin' here tonight. Go
     get sober before you come back. I'm
     tired of my child seein' this. Now
     you get yourself straight or I'll
     lock your ass out of my life for
     good.

               DOYLE
     You know what I told you, you even
     think of leavin' me, I'll kill you
     dead as a doornail.

               LINDA
     That might be better than this.

               VAUGHAN
     I'm a witness. I heard you threaten
     her life.

               DOYLE
     I thought I told you to keep out!

               LINDA
     Leave.

               DOYLE
     Don't tell me what to do.

               LINDA
     Leave.

               DOYLE
     Don't tell me what to do.

               LINDA
     Leave.

               DOYLE
     Don't tell me what to do.

               LINDA
     Leave.

               DOYLE
          (an inch from her face)
     Don't tell me what to do.

She shoves him in the chest and he slaps her hard in the
face. Vaughan starts looking for a weapon and Frank goes
wild. He starts throwing anything he can find at Doyle. Empty
cans, bottles, a lampstand.
He connects with an encyclopedia to the head. Doyle goes to
the door. His face has changed from angry to sad, almost
pitiful.

               DOYLE (CONT'D)
     Okay, I'll leave and sober up.
     Everything's botherin' me, that's
     all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.

               FRANK
     I hate you!

               DOYLE
     Well, I hate you, too. No I don't.
     I love your mama. Nobody
     understands what I go through. I'll
     leave. You bunch of freaks have
     fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey.
     I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass,
     really.
          (to Frank)
     You ever hit me again you little
     bastard and I'll make you sorry
     your daddy ever squirted your
     little ass out.

He leaves and slams the door. Frank goes to Linda's side, as
does Vaughan.

               FRANK
     You all right, Mama?

               LINDA
     I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and
     forget about tonight.

               FRANK
     We don't need to think bad
     thoughts, do we Mama?

               LINDA
     No, honey, we don't.
          (pause)
     I'll make some coffee and start
     cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you
     want some coffee, huh?

               KARL
     No, ma'am. Coffee kindly makes me
     nervous when I drink it.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Linda cleaning up the last of the mess. Frank comes in sleepy
eyed in his pajamas.

               LINDA
     What are you doin' up again, Frank?
     You need to get a little sleep.

               FRANK
     Did Vaughan go home?

               LINDA
     Yeah, he has to go to work in a
     little while. I do too.

               FRANK
     Did Karl go to bed?

               LINDA
     I guess. He went to the garage.
     Poor thing, he's probably never
     seen such a crazy mess. He probably
     wants to go back and live in Mr.
     Cox's shop.

               FRANK
     I bet he don't. Karl likes me.

               LINDA
     I know he does.

               FRANK
     Mama?

               LINDA
     Huh?

               FRANK
     Is everything gonna be all right
     someday? I just stay nervous all
     the time just about.

               LINDA
     Yeah, honey, someday everything's
     gonna be all right.

               FRANK
     Doyle wouldn't really kill you,
     would he?

               LINDA
     I promise we're gonna get away from
     him. The time has to be right,
     that's all. I'd rather him get
     tired of me and leave me. Then he
     wouldn't want to hurt me. He
     wouldn't care then. We'll be fine.
     I promise. You go to bed now.
          (she hugs him)
     I love you.

               FRANK
     I love you, too, Mama.

He goes to his room.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Linda goes into the kitchen and pours a cup of coffee and
sits at the table. After a moment, she looks up and is
startled to see Karl in the doorway.

               LINDA
     You scared me.

               KARL
     I didn't aim to.

               LINDA
     Want to sit down? Did you need
     somethin'?

               KARL
     No ma'am.

Karl just keeps standing there and Linda keeps staring.

               KARL (CONT'D)
     Two fellers was on a bridge a
     takin' a leak and one feller says
     the water was cold and the other
     said it was deep water. One of 'em
     came from Arkansas, I believe.

               LINDA
          (puzzled)
     I'll be dog.

More silence.

               KARL
     Do you reckon you can make me some
     biscuits?

               LINDA
     Right now?

               KARL
     Just whenever you take a notion to.
     I don't aim to put you out.

               LINDA
     Well, it is nearly breakfast time
     anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have
     to be at work in three hours. You
     know how it is when you just sleep
     an hour or two, you feel worse than
     if you hadn't slept at all?

               KARL
     Yes ma'am.

               LINDA
     Well, set down and I'll make some
     biscuits and gravy.

               KARL
     Mustard's good on 'em to me.

               LINDA
     Okay.

Karl sets at the table and Linda starts to make the biscuits.

               KARL
     Thank ye.

               LINDA
     It's all right.
          (pause)
     You know I was thinkin' there's
     this girl that works with me. She's
     real heavy, but she's cute in the
     face. Well, you know, she's slow.
     She's a little bit, I think. She's
     not retarded, just -- it don't
     matter, listen to me. I thought you
     might like to meet her. Vaughan
     wants to have a little supper over
     at his house and we could invite
     her. Would you like that?

               KARL
     I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.

               LINDA
     Vaughan's "friend" will be there,
     too. He works at the funeral home.
     And Frank. You know Frank likes you
     a lot. He says you make him feel
     calm.

               KARL
     I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me
     and him's made friends.

She keeps working.

               KARL (CONT'D)
     Hit ain't right for me to keep from
     tellin' you how come me to be put
     in the state hospital.

               LINDA
     That's okay. It's not really my
     business. I have wondered though.
     Why was it? Was it like a nervous
     breakdown?

               KARL
     I killed my mother and a old boy
     name Jesse Dixon. I thought they
     was a-doin' wrong. I was about your
     boy's age. They say I'm well now
     from it.

Linda stops working and turns to Karl, a little shocked, but
not as much as you would think.

               LINDA
     Was that you? I remember that. I
     was only three or four, but I
     always heard about it growin' up.
          (pause)
     They say you're well?

               KARL
     Yes ma'am.
          (pause)
     I like your garage.
          (pause)
     I wouldn't never hurt you or your
     boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible
     and say the same thing.

               LINDA
     I believe you. I really do.

EXT. COVS PARKING LOT - DAY

Bill Cox is standing beside a garden tiller with an old man.
Bill is trying to crank it up, but it won't start. A car
pulls into the parking lot and Gerry Woolridge gets out of it
and comes over to Bill.

               BILL
     How 'bout you, Jerry.

               WOOLRIDGE
     How are you, Bill?

               BILL
     Doin' pretty good. Got a sick
     tiller here. What's got you down
     this way?

               WOOLRIDGE
     Just thought I'd check on Karl and
     see if everything's working out.

               BILL
     Well, he's pretty quiet. Except for
     them rackets and breathin' things
     he does. Ain't threatened me with a
     killin' or anything.
          (laughs)
     But boy you couldn't of been more
     right about him fixin' things. That
     son of a bitch is a regular Eli
     Whitney on a lawnmower. Loves
     french fries. Eats four larges and
     don't even so much as belch. I'm
     proud to have him.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Is him stayin' here workin' out?

               BILL
     He's gone to stayin' over with that
     Wheatley boy and his mama in their
     garage. I think that little boy
     adopted him damn near like a
     mascot. But he's got a key here to
     come and go as he pleases.
     Everything's worked out good.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Can I see him?

               BILL
     Sure.

Bill looks over at Scooter, who is putting up a sale sign on
new mowers in the front window.

               BILL (CONT'D)
     Scooter! Run get Karl for me.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Woolridge and Karl lean on the hood of Woolridge's car. In
the background, Bill and the old man tinker with the tiller.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Are you sure you're okay staying
     with that woman and boy?

               KARL
     Yes sir.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Do they know about you?

               KARL
     My history.

               WOOLRIDGE
     Yeah.

               KARL
     I told 'em about it. They know I'm
     well. That Mizz Wheatley made me
     some biscuits.

               WOOLRIDGE
     I'll be.

               KARL
     That boy, he's my friend. He likes
     the way I talk and I like the way
     he talks.

               WOOLRIDGE
     I knew you'd do all right. Well, I
     just wanted to check on you. I'll
     say bye to Bill and get on back.

They walk over to Bill.

               BILL
     Karl, see if you can figure out
     what's wrong with this thing. It
     won't crank up and ever'thing seems
     to be put together right.

Karl squats beside the tiller.

               WOOLRIDGE
     I'll see you, Bill.

               BILL
     Okay, stop back by. Don't worry
     about your boy here, he's doin'
     good.

Karl looks up from the tiller holding the gas cap.

               KARL
     Hit ain't got no gas in it.

               BILL
     See there. Thinks of the simplest
     thing first.

INT. VAUGHAN'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Vaughan, ALBERT the "friend," Linda, Frank, Karl, and
MELINDA, the Dollar-Store girl, are seated at the table. Karl
and Frank are going at the delicacies while Melinda shyly
picks at hers and the others are engaged in idle chit chat.
This goes on for a few moments, then Albert's attention turns
to Karl.

               ALBERT
     So Karl, do you intend to stay in
     the lawnmower business for a while
     or do you have other plans?

               KARL
     I reckon.

               VAUGHAN
     I think Karl is going to be a
     writer or a librarian eventually.
     You should see all the books he
     has. He must read constantly.

               KARL
     I ain't read 'em yet except two or
     three of 'em. I can't understand a
     lot of what I try to read. My mind,
     hit wonders off to somethin' else
     when I try to read.

               ALBERT
     I'm the same way. Of course, in my
     line of work, I stay too busy to
     read.
     But at least I have job security.
     People may stop doing a lot of
     things, but one thing is for sure,
     they won't stop dying.

               LINDA
          (looks at Frank)
     Why don't we talk about something a
     little more festive.

               VAUGHAN
     Does everyone like the food?

Nods and yeses.

               VAUGHAN (CONT'D)
     Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm
     a good cook.

               LINDA
     Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda
     was voted employee of the month at
     the Dollar Store last February.
     Isn't that somethin'?

               KARL
     Yes ma'am, I reckon.

               MELINDA
     Well, when you like pricing items
     as much as I do, I guess it's just
     bound to happen sooner or later.

               VAUGHAN
     Karl, maybe you and Melinda might
     want to take a walk or something
     after dinner. It's a nice night.

               LINDA
     Vaughan, don't get pushy.

               VAUGHAN
     I'm sorry.

               KARL
     I like walkin' quite a bit from
     time to time.

               MELINDA
     I stay on my feet all the time at
     work. I just can't find shoes
     that's comfortable.

               ALBERT
     Hospital shoes might be the answer.
     Nurses' shoes.

               VAUGHAN
     Or the kind old ladies who work in
     the school cafeteria wear.

               ALBERT
     Same difference.

               MELINDA
     I get real mean when my feet hurt.
     It's the only time I don't like
     checkin' out the customers, when my
     feet hurt.

               LINDA
     Frank, you and Karl aren't talkin'
     much, you boys must really like
     that food.

               FRANK
     I just don't have anything to say
     about shoes.

Silence for a moment.

               VAUGHAN
     Listen everybody, I know this may
     sound corny, I've had a few glasses
     of wine and that kind of makes me a
     little emotional, but I'm going to
     say it anyway. It just came over me
     in a rush. I want you all to know
     that I care about each and every
     one of you at this table.

               LINDA
     That's very sweet of you Vaughan.
     We care about you, too. Don't we
     y'all?

Nods, grunts, "Sure do's."

               VAUGHAN
     Also, Melinda, please don't tell
     anybody at the store that Albert
     was here tonight, okay.

               MELINDA
     Why?

               VAUGHAN
     Well, a lot of people in town talk
     and spread cruel rumors.
     Unfortunately, I have to keep
     certain parts of my life private.

               MELINDA
     You mean about y'all bein' together
     in "that" way?

               VAUGHAN
     Yes.

               MELINDA
     I think everybody at the store
     knows that already. They always
     talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter
     told a awful story about why you
     ain't allowed over at the First
     Baptist Church no more.

               LINDA
     Karl, why don't you and Melinda go
     take a walk. It's nice out.

               KARL
     All right then.

He gets up and walks toward the front door. Melinda gets up
and tries to catch up.

EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Karl and Melinda are walking in the moonlight. It seems a
little hard for Melinda to keep up.

               MELINDA
     You walk fast, don't you?

               KARL
     I reckon.

They walk a little farther in silence.

               MELINDA
     These is the worst shoes I own for
     walkin'. How far did you want to
     go?

               KARL
     I ain't really thought about it too
     much I don't reckon.

They walk until they disappear into the darkness.

INT. COX'S SHOP - DAY

Karl is on the floor working on a mower with Scooter, they
are ad libbing semi-technical lawnmower things. Bill Cox
appears in the door.

               BILL
     Hey Karl, they's somebody out here
     to see you. Some gal holding a nice
     bouquet.
          (Karl doesn't move)
     Come on now, she wants to talk to
     you. Don't just set there.

Karl gets up and goes to the counter followed by Scooter.
Melinda stands on the other side of the counter holding a
cellophane wrapped store-bought flower assortment. Nobody
says anything for a moment.

               MELINDA
     Hi, Karl, I'm on lunch break. These
     was on sale 'cause they're not
     fresh. Two ninety-nine a bunch plus
     my ten percent employee discount.
     Since I didn't bring you anything
     to our date last night, I thought
     you'd like to have 'em.

She hands them to him.

               KARL
     Thank ye.

               BILL
     Scooter, let's me and you go over
     to Dairy Queen and pick up a few
     things for lunchtime.

               SCOOTER
     I can go. You don't have to. You
     don't never go.

               BILL
     Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Pardon
     my language, ma'am.

They start to leave. At the door, Bill Cox turns and winks at
Karl. They exit leaving Karl and Melinda staring at the
counter. They are silent for a while.

               MELINDA
     Well, I just thought I'd give you
     them. I liked walkin' with you. I
     got a blister the size of a quarter
     on one heel. Well, I'll see you
     sometime, I guess.

She walks to the door and stops as if she expects Karl to say
something.

               KARL
     A blister shore can hurt.

               MELINDA
     Yeah.

               KARL
     Flowers is pretty. I've always
     thought that.

               MELINDA
     Me, too.

She leaves and Karl goes to the window holding the flowers
and watches her walk away.

EXT. SIDEWALK - DUSK

Holding the flowers, Karl is walking down the sidewalk toward
the Wheatley house when he sees Frank coming out the front
door with a book and a flashlight. He sees Karl.

               FRANK
     Hey Karl, you off work?

               KARL
     Yeah.

               FRANK
     Where'd you get them flowers?

               KARL
     That gal that made employee of the
     month give 'em to me for awalkin'
     with her.

               FRANK
     I was goin' to the secret place. I
     borried one of your books to take
     down there. You ain't mad, are you?

               KARL
     Naw. You can look at all my books
     you want to.

               FRANK
     It's name's A Christmas Carol.

               KARL
     That's than un on Christmas I was
     tellin' you about.

               FRANK
     You want to go with me?

               KARL
     Yeah.

EXT. SECRET PLACE - NIGHT

Karl and Frank sit in the clearing, Karl on the stump, Frank
on the ground. Frank is shining the flashlight on the book.
He finishes reading a few lines and turns off the flashlight.

               FRANK
     I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a
     while.

               KARL
     All right then.

               FRANK
     Boy, folks sure had it rough back a
     long time ago, didn't they?

               KARL
     Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like
     to tore me up when I read about
     that pore little cripple boy.

               FRANK
     Yeah, me too.
          (pause)
     That was nice of that woman to give
     you them flowers.

               KARL
     Hit was right thoughty of her.

               FRANK
     I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.

               KARL
     All right then.

               FRANK
     You know that girl I told you
     about. The one I love.

               KARL
     Yeah, I recollect it.

               FRANK
     Would you go see her with me? I
     kind of thought I might take her
     some flowers like that woman done
     you.

               KARL
     If you want me to.

               FRANK
     I ain't got no money to get 'em
     with but I bet Vaughan will let me
     have some of them flowers at the
     store.

               KARL
     I bet he will. I got a little money
     if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.

               FRANK
     I usually get run off by her mama
     or daddy if they're home. Reckon
     why they don't like me?

               KARL
     They ort to. You're a good boy.

               FRANK
     Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean
     I don't love her.

               KARL
     Naw.

               FRANK
     And I don't try to touch her. You
     know, in a bad way. Foolin' around,
     sex and all.

               KARL
     That's real good. You ort not to if
     ye ain't married to somebody. Bible
     tells you that much. Hit tells some
     things that don't seem right too, I
     reckon. I guess a feller ort to
     foller it close as he can, though.
          (pause)
     You don't touch yourself, do you?

               FRANK
     What do you mean?

               KARL
     Pull on your works. Your privates.

               FRANK
     Oh, jackin' off?

               KARL
     Yes sir. You ort not know that
     language.

               FRANK
     I didn't know till here while back
     a year or two ago when I spent the
     night with Ronnie Smart one time.
     He said just tug on your peter and
     think about your mama. I tried it,
     but I felt funny thinkin' about my
     mama. So, I switched over to
     thinkin' about his mama and then
     what he told me would happen,
     happened. It sure tingles, don't
     it?

               KARL
     You ort not to pull on yourself
     that away.

               FRANK
     I kind of like you tellin' me what
     to do and not to do. Just like my
     daddy. I didn't mind him tellin'
     me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to
     do. Mama said the only way to ever
     get away from him is for him to get
     away from us. That we can't leave
     him or he'll try and hurt her.

               KARL
     He ain't no count.

               FRANK
     You don't seem like a daddy. You
     seem like a brother.
          (pause)
     Wonder what makes you like somebody
     right off when you don't even know
     'em like what happened with me and
     you.

               KARL
     I don't reckon I know.

               FRANK
     And then some people you don't like
     right off. It's funny.
          (pause)
     You know why I want you to play
     ball with me?

               KARL
     Naw.

               FRANK
     'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if
     you ain't no good. It takes your
     mind off of everything else while
     you're doin' it. When you run real
     fast tryin' to make a touchdown you
     don't think about anything else. I
     ain't no good, but my daddy always
     said he was proud of me when I
     threw a ball or ran with it. Did
     you have any brothers and sisters
     growin' up to play with?

               KARL
     I had one there for little bit. Hit
     didn't get old enough to play with.

               FRANK
     Why not? It died?

               KARL
     Yeah.

               FRANK
     Why?

               KARL
     Hit was borned a little too early
     on. My mother and father made hit
     come too early some way or other. I
     reckon they changed their mind
     about havin' another'n. I was about
     six or eight year old then and they
     didn't care too much for me so I
     reckon they didn't need somethin'
     else to worry 'em with.

               FRANK
     So it died when it come out?

               KARL
     My daddy come to the shed out back
     and got me and said throw this here
     away and handed me a towel with
     somethin' in it. I went for the
     trash barrel there and opened up
     the towel to see 'cause they was a
     noise and somethin' movin' in it.
     Hit was bloody-like around that
     towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty
     baby, no bigger than a squirrel.

               FRANK
     It was alive?

               KARL
     Yes sir. Right then it was.

               FRANK
     A boy or girl?

               KARL
     A little ol' boy.

               FRANK
     You threw it in a trash barrel?

               KARL
     I didn't feel right about doin'
     that. I takened a shoe box from
     there in the shed and emptied out
     some screwdrivers and nuts and
     warshers from it and put the little
     feller in that and buried him in
     the corner of the yard there. That
     seemed more proper to me, I reckon.

               FRANK
     It was still alive when you buried
     it?

               KARL
     I heared it cryin' a little through
     that box.

               FRANK
     That don't seem right. It seems
     like you should have kept him alive
     and took care of him if he was your
     brother.

               KARL
     I wadn't but six or eight. I reckon
     I didn't know what to do. I didn't
     know how to care for no baby. Mama
     and Daddy didn't want him. They
     learned me to do what they told me
     to. These days I figure it might of
     been best to give him right back to
     the Good Lord right off the bat
     anyhow.

               FRANK
     That makes me feel real sad.
     Couldn't you have done somethin',
     Karl? I would have. I wish I would
     of had him. He'd be here right now.
     Livin'.

               KARL
     Hits been hard thinkin' about it.
     They ain't a day goes by I don't
     think about it. I kindly have a
     picture of it up in my head that I
     see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have
     bad thoughts on it. I wished they
     was somethin' I could of did, too.
     Shouldn't no bad things happen to
     childern. All the ol' bad things
     ort to be saved up for folks that's
     growed up, the way I see it. I
     shouldn't of told you about that. A
     boy ort not hear about such things.
     It just kindly come out.

               FRANK
     I didn't mean to say anything bad
     about you. I know you're good. You
     didn't mean no harm.
          (pause)
     Did you ever think about killin'
     yourself on purpose like my daddy
     did?

               KARL
     I've studied about it. The Bible
     says not to or you end up goin' to
     Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I
     call it Hades.

               FRANK
     Bible says the same thing about
     killin' others, too.

               KARL
     Yes sir, I reckon it does.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Frank, flowers in hand, and Karl approach a very nice two
story house. They get to the door and Frank rings the
doorbell.

               FRANK
     I always get nervous when I hear
     that doorbell. I'm okay just
     walkin' over, but somethin' about
     that dang doorbell. They have one
     room where you can't walk on the
     carpet or sit on the furniture. I
     don't see much sense in havin' it.

The door opens and we see an older black lady, the
HOUSEKEEPER.

               HOUSEKEEPER
          (eyes Karl)
     Son, I don't know why you keep
     comin' over here. You know these
     folks don't want you here. They run
     you off ever' time. Don't keep
     doin' this to yourself. You a sweet
     boy. Now go give them flowers to
     somebody that'll enjoy 'em.

               FRANK
     Ma'am, I really want to give them
     to Karen.

               HOUSEKEEPER
          (to Karl)
     You his daddy?

               KARL
     No ma'am.

               HOUSEKEEPER
     Well, whoever you are, you ought to
     talk some sense into him. That
     little old girl is way too fast for
     him and don't wanna see him no way.

               FRANK
     Will you get her for me. Please. I
     really want to see her.
     She'll want to see me, too, 'cause
     we're not in public. Just don't
     tell her folks I'm here.

               HOUSEKEEPER
          (sighs)
     Okay.

She disappears and a moment later KAREN appears. She's
thirteen, pretty and very neatly dressed.

               KAREN
          (put out)
     Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming
     over here. My parents really don't
     want you to.

               FRANK
     I wanted to bring you some flowers.
     They're pretty good ones.

               KAREN
     They're from the Dollar Store. I'm
     not an idiot. Besides we have a
     garden full of flowers.

She eyes Karl.

               FRANK
     I wanted for you to meet Karl, too.
     He's my new friend. But I feel like
     I've always known him. I thought
     you should meet him.

               KAREN
     Why? Hi, Karl.

               FRANK
     He's gonna be around a lot and I
     hope you are too, so...

               KAREN
     Here give me the flowers, I'll do
     something with them. Thank you. Now
     you better go. Maybe I'll see you
     down at the secret place one day in
     a week or two or something. I have
     a boyfriend now you know. And we're
     pretty serious. He gave me a ring.

She proudly displays the ring.

               FRANK
     Can you go there with us now? Me
     and Karl. We could just hang out.
     Karl has some cool books.

               KAREN
     Frank, I just like you as a friend.
     Only at the secret place. Okay? I
     can't go there now. I'll see you
     later.

               FRANK
     But maybe just for awhile --

               KAREN
     I'm closing the door now. I told
     you, I'll see you later.

She closes the door. They stand therefor a moment, then walk
away down the sidewalk.

               FRANK
     She said she'd see me later. That's
     kinda good, right?

               KARL
     I reckon.

EXT. WHEATLEY HOUSE - DAY

Frank and Karl walk up the steps to the house. Frank opens
the door and they enter.

INT. HOUSE - DAY

As Frank and Karl enter, they see Doyle sitting on a
footstool facing Linda who's in a chair. Doyle is holding
both her hands and talking very softly to her. He sees the
guys and looks up.

               DOYLE
     Well, I'll be damned, there's the
     boys. I'm glad y'all came in. I
     wanted to talk to y'all, too. I was
     just tellin' Linda here -- Oh hell,
     I'll just start over, set down you
     boys.

They do, on the couch.

               DOYLE (CONT'D)
     Well, what it is is, I just, well I
     took off work early today and your
     mama was good enough to do the same
     so we could talk. I guess you'd say
     I'm really here to apologize, which
     ain't easy for me to do, about the
     way I acted the other night. I was
     just drunk and kinda got a little
     too worked up and one thing led to
     another. I care about y'all a lot,
     I do. I don't mean to be so damned,
     assholish I guess the word would
     be. Now Karl, I don't believe I hit
     you, did I? So no apology needed
     there I guess, but Frank, I'm
     sorry. I'm sorry I hit your mama.
     I'm just jealous of her. I don't
     like her life or the way she runs
     it. I don't like homosexuals and
     she buddies with one. I don't like
     little wimpy ass kids or fuckin'
     mental retards and she's got one of
     each livin' with her.
          (laughs)
     I was just kiddin'. But really I
     guess people need to get along even
     if they have differences.
          (pause)
     You see, I work construction. I
     build things. Do you realize how
     important that is to the world. I
     have a lot of pressure on me. The
     upshot is, I'm gonna spend a lot
     more time over here and we're gonna
     get along. Like a family should.
          (to Linda)
     I may even surprise you one day and
     pop the question.
          (he gets up)
     Well, I'm goin' back to work. I
     just wanted to give y'all some
     little piece of happiness today.
          (kisses Linda)
     See you tonight honey. Karl. Be a
     good boy, Frank.

He leaves.

               LINDA
     Well, at least he's tryin'. But who
     knows for how long.

               FRANK
     He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do
     better.

               LINDA
     I know honey. Just remember what I
     said, we'll bide our time. You just
     steer clear of him as much as you
     can. Doyle's had a real hard life.
     It's just about run him crazy I
     think.

               FRANK
     We've had a real hard life, too,
     Mama.

Linda moves to the couch and puts her arms around Frank.

               LINDA
     You're a hell of a boy, Frank.
     Someday you're gonna get all the
     good things you deserve. And Karl
     here's gonna get some more biscuits
     tonight. What do you think about
     that?

               KARL
     I could shore use some. Thank ye.

INT. SHOP - DAY

Karl is cleaning some parts in a bucket of gasoline. Bill
comes to the door.

               BILL
     Hey there Karl, can you come unload
     a generator for me?

Karl wipes his hands on a shop towel and starts outside.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

A MAN and a TEENAGE BOY stand by a pickup truck. A small
generator is on the tailgate.

               BILL
     Karl, lift this thing down and
     carry it to the back. It's on the
     blink.
          (to man as Karl unloads
           it)
     We'll have it for you in a day or
     two, Walter.

               WALTER
     Y'ont us to he'p you there liftin'
     that?

               BILL
     Oh no, that dang Karl can lift a
     bulldozier. Fix anything, too.
          (confidentially)
     He's mentally retarded, but he's a
     whiz on small engines. Lord works
     in mysterious ways.

Karl carries the generator toward the shop. He turns and
watches the man and boy talking and laughing with Bill. The
man playfully puts an arm around his son's neck and tousles
his hair.

               WALTER
     Hell, he didn't just make the team,
     Coach says he's probably gonna
     start at end on defense. He's a
     chip off the old block. Ain't you,
     Steve?

               STEVE
     I guess so.

Karl turns and goes in the shop.

INT. WHEATLEY GARAGE - DAY

Karl is on his cot reading a book. Frank comes in. He looks
very depressed. He sits beside Karl.

               FRANK
     What you readin'?

               KARL
     Readin' on this book on how to work
     carpentry. I aim to learn how to
     build things out of wood one of
     these times. I've always been
     partial to wood buildin's and
     cabinets and whatnot. These
     drawin's they got here don't make
     no sense to me so far.
          (he looks directly at
           Frank, which he seldom
           does)
     You seem like yore tails a'draggin'
     a might. You got somethin' wrong
     with ye?

               FRANK
     Seems like Doyle's wormed his way
     back in. Mama said he's stayin'
     over tonight and he's talkin' about
     movin' in for good. We ain't ever
     gonna be happy. We'll always be
     nervous, won't we Karl?

               KARL
     I don't reckon I know. I ain't
     found no way yet and I'm three or
     four times as old as you. Might be
     that's just the way folks is.

               FRANK
     I feel sad about Karen Cross, too.
     I just make like to myself she
     loves me. I know better, though. It
     just feels good to me when I
     imagine it.

               KARL
     Make believin' always made me feel
     good too from time to time.

They sit in silence for a moment.

               KARL (CONT'D)
     Bill Cox is goin' to a funeral for
     a Mister Turner tomorrow and a
     closin' up shop early.

               FRANK
     Is that right?

               KARL
     I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if
     neither one of us is no count it
     won't make no difference.

               FRANK
     You will? For sure?

               KARL
     Yeah.

               FRANK
     We'll be on teams, me and you?

               KARL
     Yessir.

EXT. JUNIOR HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

It's the practice field, so it's not very well kept. Karl,
Frank, and two other boys around Frank's age are huddled up.
Four boys are lined on defense. They break the huddle and
come to the line. They are on about the fifty-yard line.
Frank hikes the ball to one of the boys. He later als it to
Karl who stands there for a minute as the defenders run
toward him. Then he takes off like the wind. He runs funny,
kind of humped over and pigeon-toed, but fast. All the others
are chasing him. Two of the other team's boys catch him on
about the fifteen-yard line, but he drags them along. Karl
sees Frank out of the corner of his eye and tosses him the
ball just as Karl bites the dirt. Frank goes into the end
zone untouched. There are cheers from Frank and the other
boys. Frank runs over to Karl who's still on the ground.

               FRANK
     Way to go, Karl. We got a
     touchdown. That was a good lateral,
     man. That was just like the
     Wishbone.

               KARL
     I dern near had me a touchdown till
     them boys got a-hold of me there so
     I figured I better give it off to
     you. I seen you over there
     follerin' me.

               FRANK
     We're liable to win if we keep this
     up. For somebody like you, you sure
     run fast.

He grabs Karl by the hands and helps pull him up.

               FRANK (CONT'D)
     Come on, let's kick off to 'em.

EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

Karl and Frank, dirt, grass stains and all, walk toward home.

               FRANK
     I know you could of scored them
     three touchdowns by yourself
     instead of throwing 'em over to me.

               KARL
     Them boys was tryin' to pull me
     down pretty hard.

               FRANK
     You're strong though. You let me
     make them touchdowns so I'd feel
     good. My daddy used to do that kind
     of thing.

They walk in silence for a moment.

               FRANK (CONT'D)
     It don't matter to me about us
     losin' does it to you?

               KARL
     No sir.

               FRANK
     It was fun, anyhow.

               KARL
     I wadn't thinkin' about nothin'
     else just like you told me I'd do.

               FRANK
     Can we play ever' Saturday?

               KARL
     If I ain't too stove up. I ain't
     like you. I'm old and give out.
          (pause)
     I'm proud of ye.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

Karl sits on his bed rubbing his hands together, deep in
thought.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Karl is walking down the street past rundown houses. He comes
to an old gray woodframe house. It is in bad repair, the
paint is peeling, the yard is grown up. There is an old
wooden shed in the back yard. He stands looking at it for a
moment then walks through the yard and opens the door to the
shed. He's motionless for a moment, then goes inside.

INT. SHED - DAY

Sunlight comes through the cracks in the wood. The shed has
nothing but dirt for a floor. A few tall patches of grass
shoot up between boxes and rusty lawnmowers. A few old garden
tools hang on the wall. In the center is a low circular spot
in the ground and a few tattered shreds of an old quilt.
Karl stands looking at the hole for a moment, then turns and
walks out of the shed.

EXT. YARD - DAY

Karl walks across the yard to the house.

INT. SCREENED-IN PORCH - DAY

Karl goes onto the screened-in porch, looks through the
kitchen window and goes inside.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

The place is a mess. Dirty dishes are piled in the sink and
on the table. It's not just clutter, but filth everywhere.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Karl walks into an equally filthy living room where an OLD
MAN in overalls sits slumped in a chair looking at his lap.
Karl stands facing him for several moments.

               KARL
     I'm ye boy.

               OLD MAN
     I ain't got no boy.

               KARL
     I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.

               OLD MAN
     I ain't got no boy.

               KARL
     They turned me aloose from the
     nervous hospital. Said I was well.

No response.

               KARL (CONT'D)
     I got hired to work for a Mr. Cox
     fixin' lawnmowers and whatnot.

No response.

               KARL (CONT'D)
     That grass out in the yard's all
     growed up. I figured I might cut it
     fer ye.

               OLD MAN
     I told you, I ain't got no boy, now
     get on out from here and let me be.

Long silence.

               KARL
     I learned to read some. I've read
     on the Bible quite a bit. I don't
     understand all of it, but I believe
     I understand a good deal of it.
     Them stories Mama and you told me
     ain't in there. You ort not to of
     done that to ye boy.
          (pause)
     I've studied on killin' you. But I
     don't reckon they's no reason fer
     it if all you're gonna do is set
     there in that chair. You'll be dead
     soon enough I reckon and the
     world'll be shut of ye.
          (Karl walks toward the
           kitchen and turns back to
           the old man)
     You ort not to of killed my
     brother. He ort to have had a
     chance to grow up. Sometimes he
     would of had fun.

EXT. YARD

Karl walks out of the house and across the yard to a hedge in
the corner and kneels down. He pushes some grass aside to
reveal a rock about afoot tall and afoot across. In front of
it, the ground is raised a little. He stares at the rock for
a moment and touches it.

               KARL
     Little feller.

EXT. A LARGE OLD WOODEN SLAT BRIDGE - DUSK

Karl stands on the side of the bridge looking into the river
below.

INT. WHEATLEY HOUSE - NIGHT

All the lights are out. We see a shot of Frank in his bed
asleep, but tossing and turning. Then a shot of Linda in bed
staring at the ceiling and Doyle beside her snoring.
Suddenly, the lights come on and Linda lets out a little yelp
and sits up, which wakes up Doyle and he sits up with a
start. From their P.O.V. we see Karl standing in the door
holding a hammer.

               DOYLE
     What in the goddamn hell are you
     doin'? It's the middle of the
     night.

               LINDA
     What do you want, hun?

               KARL
     I want to be baptized.

               DOYLE
     Baptized? Well, get baptized then.
     I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin'
     preacher, goddamnit! I can't
     baptize you.

               LINDA
     We'll go to church and get you
     baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go
     on back to bed.

               DOYLE
     What are you doin' with that damn
     hammer?

               KARL
     I don't rightly know. I just kindly
     woke up a-holdin' it.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

We see a shot of Frank and Linda and Vaughan in a church pew.
The church is pretty full. From their P.O.V. we seek Karl in
a robe standing in the baptismal tank. The preacher takes
Karl and dunks him under the water and brings him back up.

INT. WHEATLEY LIVING ROOM - DAY

Doyle is in his favorite chair as Linda, Frank, and Karl come
through the front door.

               DOYLE
     How'd your baptizin' go?

               LINDA
     It went real good.

               DOYLE
     Well, that's good. It's about time
     to eat and you know what I'm
     cravin'? Some of that take out
     chicken. Why don't you run get some
     of it, honey, for lunch?

               LINDA
          (to Frank and Karl)
     Would y'all like that?

               FRANK
     Yeah, I guess.

               KARL
     Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken
     leg.

               LINDA
     All right, y'all gonna go with me?

               DOYLE
     Naw, hell, let them stay here with
     me and do men things. There might
     be some kind of ball game on we can
     watch. You go on.

               LINDA
     I'll be back in a little bit then.

She leaves and Doyle walks up to Karl and Frank.

               DOYLE
     I really just wanted to git your
     mama out of the house for a minute
     so we can have a talk. Y'all set
     down.

They sit on the couch and Doyle kneels in front of them.

               DOYLE
     Now here's the deal. Now that I'm
     gonna throw my entire life away
     doin' what I want to come live here
     with y'all, we have to get a few
     things straight. See, Frank, me and
     you mama wouldn't have any problems
     if it wadn't for you. We'd never
     have a bad word between us. But
     since you do exist, if I'm gonna be
     here as the head of the household,
     we'll have to live by my rules.
     And my rules are you don't speak
     unless you're spoken to. Stay out
     of my way and do what a regular kid
     does. You're a weird little shit. I
     don't get you. So wake up. Face
     what they call reality. We're gonna
     be a family now. And it's my
     family. I'll be payin' the bills so
     you got me. But I ain't your daddy.
     You just treat me like I am. I'm
     the boss, okay. And the other thing
     is your friend Karl has to go. We
     can't have a normal family with him
     livin' in the garage and comin' in
     the bedroom at four in the mornin'
     with hammers and shit. See?

               FRANK
     Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama
     said --

Doyle slaps him across the face and Karl grabs Doyle's arm.
Doyle shakes him off.

               KARL
     Don't hit that boy no more.

               DOYLE
     You shut up you, fuckin' retard.
     Get your shit and get out of here.
          (to Frank)
     That was a wake-up slap, Frank.
     Remember. Reality, like I said.
     Don't forget any bit of what I said
     to you and we'll be fine.

Frank jumps up and runs from the house and Doyle sits back in
his chair and pops a beer. Karl gets up and goes to the
garage.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

Karl ties his books up with his strap and gets a bag from his
bed and leaves.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

Karl is walking away as Linda pulls up in her car and gets
out with fast-food bags.

               LINDA
     Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't
     you want some chicken and things?

               KARL
     No ma'am. I'm a'goin' off sommers.

               LINDA
     Well, okay. I got you some.

               KARL
     Frank, he went off, too. He ain't
     gonna be in there when you get
     indoors.

               LINDA
     Where'd he go? What's goin' on?

               KARL
     He wanted to go off and play, I
     reckon.
          (pause)
     You go in there and you and that
     Doyle eat ye dinner. You don't have
     to worry yourself none.

               LINDA
     All right then. Well, I'll see you
     later. If you see Frank, tell him
     to come on back home. I don't get
     to see him all day except Sundays.
     He can play tomorrow.

               KARL
     Ma'am?

               LINDA
     Yeah.

               KARL
     You're a good mama to that boy. You
     care for him. You work hard fer him
     to take care of him. You light him
     up in his eyes, I've seen it. He
     wouldn't know what to do without
     ye.

               LINDA
     Well thank you, hun. That's real
     good of you to say. I wouldn't know
     what to do without him either.

               KARL
     You've been real good to me, too.
     It ain't ever'body that'd make
     biscuits in the middle of the
     night. You and that boy has give me
     a good feelin'.

               LINDA
     We sure like havin' you.

               KARL
     Thank ye.
          (Karl walks away, then
           turns)
     I'm just getting around to tellin'
     you, but I fixed your warshin'
     machine.

EXT. SECRET PLACE - DAY

Frank is on the ground digging a trench in the dirt with a
stick. He hears footsteps in the leaves and looks up and sees
Karl coming toward him.

               FRANK
     Hey, Karl. How'd you know to come
     out here?

               KARL
     I knowed you'd be here.
          (Karl sits on the stump)
     What are you a-doin' digging with
     that stob?

               FRANK
     Just diggin'.
          (pause)
     I ain't ever gonna be happy now.
     Not with that son of a bitch movin'
     in for good. I wish me and you and
     Mama could just run away. But she
     said he would find us wherever we
     went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think
     it would of been better if I wadn't
     ever born.

               KARL
     I'm glad of it you was borned.
          (pause)
     I reckon I ain't gonna be there in
     the garage no more.

               FRANK
     You have to Karl. You have to look
     out for me. You don't let that son
     of a bitch run you off.

               KARL
     You're just a boy. You ort not to
     use that sort of language.

               FRANK
     Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin'
     bad about you, but why don't you
     stop Doyle when he gets that away?
     You're older than him. You're
     strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let
     him do that to me and Mama.

               KARL
     That feller's a whole sight meaner
     than me. He'd just whup the tar out
     of me.

               FRANK
     Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired,
     you know that. A kid my age
     shouldn't be tired of things.

               KARL
     I'm tired, too, Frank.
          (pause)
     If I ain't around no more, it don't
     mean I don't care fer ye. I care
     for ye a good deal. I care for you
     more than anybody they is. We made
     friends right off the bat.

               FRANK
     I care for you, too. But you'll be
     around, don't say that.

               KARL
     Hit don't make no difference where
     I was to be. We'll always be
     friends. There ain't no way to stop
     that.
          (pause)
     I aim for you to have these books.

He hands him the books.

               KARL
     Maybe you can make more sense out
     of them than I can.
     I made you a little old book marker
     and stuck it in that book on
     Christmas.

               FRANK
     You don't want to give away all
     your books.

               KARL
     I aim fer you to have 'em.

               FRANK
     Man. Thanks.
          (pause)
     You know when you get a feelin' and
     you don't know why?

               KARL
     Yes sir.

               FRANK
     I've got a feelin' today.

               KARL
     Reckon what kind of a feelin'?

               FRANK
     Like something different. I don't
     know.
          (pause)
     You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?

               KARL
     Will ye do somethin' for me if I
     ast you to?

               FRANK
     You know I would. Whatever you
     want.

               KARL
     Don't go home tonight and stay with
     that Doyle. He's got it in for ye
     tonight. I got me a feelin', too.
     Feels like to me you ort not be
     there in that house with him
     liquored up and mean. Ye mama
     neither. When you get up from here,
     I want you to go to that feller's
     house. Your mama's friend. I want
     you to give me your word on it.

               FRANK
     Okay. I give you my word. Is
     ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you
     all right?

               KARL
     Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly
     want to put my arm around ye for a
     minute and then I'm gonna go on and
     leave here.

               FRANK
     Okay.

Karl lays his arm on Frank's shoulder and Frank puts his hand
on Karl's arm. They sit like that for a few moments, then
Karl gets up with his paper sack and walks away. Frank takes
the book marker out of the Christmas book. It is just a
folded piece of notebook paper. On it is written 'You will be
happy.' He looks up at Karl who is now thirty yards away in
the trees.

               FRANK (CONT'D)
     Karl!

Karl turns around and he and Frank stare at each other
through the trees.

EXT. VAUGHAN'S HOUSE - DAY

Karl knocks on the door. After a moment, Vaughan answers in a
pair of big shorts and a sweatshirt.

               VAUGHAN
     Karl, what are you doing here? Come
     in.

               KARL
     I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast
     you fer a favor.

               VAUGHAN
     Okay.

               KARL
     This evenin' I want you to go get
     Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and
     have them stay with you tonight.

               VAUGHAN
     What's wrong? Is everything okay?

               KARL
     That dern Doyle is in a bad way
     again with that drinkin' and bein'
     mean to folks. Will you give me
     your word you'll do it?

               VAUGHAN
     Well, sure, okay. He hasn't hurt
     them, has he?

               KARL
     Naw, not yet.
          (hands the bag to Vaughan)
     I want ye to give this to Mizz
     Wheatley. Hit ain't much, but maybe
     there's a little somethin' to hep
     out. Hits what I've earned fixin'
     lawnmowers and whatnot fer Bill
     Cox.

Vaughan takes the bag.

               VAUGHAN
     What about you, Karl? Do you want
     to stay here?

               KARL
     I don't reckon you have to go with
     women to be a daddy to a boy.
          (pause)
     You've been real square dealin'
     with me. The Bible says two men ort
     not lay together. But I'll bet you
     the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody
     like you to Hades. Some folks calls
     it Hell, I call it Hades.
          (Karl starts away)
     That boy lives inside of his own
     heart. Hits an awful big place. You
     take care of that boy.

Vaughan watches Karl walk away.

EXT. BUS STATION - NIGHT

Karl stares at the bus station door.

EXT. WHEATLEY HOUSE - NIGHT

Karl stares at the house from the sidewalk.

EXT. OLD WOODS BRIDGE - NIGHT

Karl stares into the river.

INT. COX'S SHOP - NIGHT

Karl has a lawnmower blade sharpening it on a grinding wheel.

EXT. WHEATLEY HOUSE - NIGHT

Karl carrying the blade walks onto the porch and enters the
living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Doyle is in his chair drinking beer and watching TV. He looks
up as Karl comes around and sits on the sofa.

               DOYLE
     Where's ever'body else? You seen
     'em?
          (no response)
     I thought I told you to get the
     hell moved out of here anyway.

               KARL
     How does a feller go about gettin'
     ahold of the police?

               DOYLE (CONT'D)
     Pick up the fuckin' phone and call
     'em, I guess.

               KARL
     What numbers do you punch?

               DOYLE
     I told you to get away from here,
     didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and
     look at TV.
          (notices blade)
     What are you doin' with that piece
     of iron? I swear to God you're the
     weirdest son of a bitch I ever
     heard of.

               KARL
     I aim to kill you with it.

Doyle keeps drinking and watching TV.

               DOYLE
     Yeah, okay. Well, to get the police
     you push 911. You'll need to tell
     'em to send an ambulance, too. Or a
     hearse. You fuckin' idiot. You're
     gonna kill me.
          (laughs)

Karl gets up and walks slowly toward Doyle out of frame. We
see the flickering light of the TV on the wall. O.S. we hear
one short dull thud.

               DOYLE (O.S.)
     Oh God! Oh God!

We hear one more thud, then the sound of Doyle's body hitting
the floor. Karl appears in frame again and we follow him to
the kitchen where he picks up the wall phone. He stares at it
for a moment, then pushes 911. He has a few specks of blood
on his face, hand and shirt.

               KARL
          (into phone)
     Yes ma'am. I need the police over
     here at the Wheatley house.
          (pause)
     I've killed somebody with a mower
     blade.
          (pause)
     Yes ma'am, I'm right sure of it. I
     hit him two good whacks. That
     second time just plumb near cut his
     head in two.
          (pause)
     Hits a little old yeller house
     right on the corner of Marigold
     Street and some other street.
     They's a red pickup truck out front
     says DOYLE HARGRAVES CONSTRUCTION
     on it. I'll be a settin' here
     waitin' on ye. Beside sendin' the
     police, Doyle said you might want
     to send a ambulance or a hearse.
     Thank ye.

He hangs up and goes to the refrigerator and takes out a jar
of mustard. He gets a knife out of the drawer and sits at the
kitchen table and pulls back a table cloth that is covering
up some leftovers. He picks up a biscuit and opens the
mustard jar and runs the knife around it.
There's hardly any mustard in it. He dabs a little on the
biscuit and takes a bite and relaxes to wait for the law.

                              CUT TO:

CLOSE UP OF CHARLES THE NUT CASE

He's in the middle of one of his sick monologues. We pull
back and see we're in the recreation room of the hospital
again with Karl in his usual chair listening to Charles. Karl
is now wearing the hospital issue clothing.

               CHARLES
     ... on the third day I washed her.
     She wasn't very clean. I got all
     the right spots. She was the first
     one I ever kept for any length of
     time, you see I get bored easily, I
     have a short attention span. I
     can't say she enjoyed her stay,
     although the washcloth in her mouth
     held in place by good duct tape
     kept any complaints to a minimum. I
     don't really like people who talk a
     lot. I like to do the talking. I
     guess that's why I'm so fond of
     you. You're so easygoing, although
     I do sense a little tension in you
     sometimes. By the way, how was it
     out there? Did you have any fun?
     Make any new acquaintances? Tell me
     what it was like.

               KARL
     They was a boy. We made friends.

               CHARLES
     I bet you did. I was never bent
     that way. I'm bent the other way.
     So, you liked it out there in the
     world.

               KARL
     It's too big.

               CHARLES
     Well, it's not too big in here, is
     it?
          (pause)
     I feel very generous today. I feel
     like listening. I'm sure you have
     plenty to tell me. And please bore
     me with the details.
          (long pause) )
     Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was
     it the boy?

               KARL
     Don't say nothin' about that boy.

Karl looks him right in the eye for the first time ever.

               KARL
     Fact the bidness, don't you say
     another word to me. I ain't
     listenin' to you no more.

Karl gets up and goes to the window and looks out at the
grass that separates him from the next building. He stares
out the window, as we:

                              FADE OUT.

                     THE END
