     TITLE CARD: Fiction
     
     INT. MARCUS'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
     
     The time is circa 1985.
     
     Vi and Marcus finish making love. Marcus has cerebral palsy.
     
                    MARCUS
          Hey, you want to hear my short      
          story now?
               
                    VI
          Huh?
               
                    MARCUS
               (lifts a MS from a shelf by his bed)
          I can read it to you.
               
                    VI
          You mean, again?
               
                    MARCUS
          Well, I changed the ending a      
          little.
               
                    VI
          Oh. What happens now?
               
                    MARCUS
          Well, actually, it's the same, but 
          longer. I think it's better. 
          More...raw.
               
                    VI
          Well then, maybe you should just      
          read the ending.
               
                    MARCUS
          But it won't make any sense if you 
          hear it out of context.
     
                    VI
          I think you should leave it the      
          way it was. It was good.
               
     Pause.
     
                    MARCUS
          So you don't want to hear my new      
          ending?
               
                    VI
          You'll read it in class tomorrow.      
          Surprise me.
               (beat)
          Anyway, I have to go. I promised      
          Melinda I'd help her with her 
          oral.
               
     She rises, starts dressing.
     
                    MARCUS
          You're tired of me. I can tell.
               
                    VI
          Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
               
                    MARCUS
          You've lost interest...You hardly      
          even sweat any more when we 
          have sex.
     
                    VI
          I was never much of a sweater. You 
          know that.
     
                    MARCUS
          Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You      
          feel You feel pity now. The 
          pleasure isn't there any more. The 
          kinkiness has gone...You've 
          become kind. 
     
     EXT. CAMPUS GREEN - DAY
     
     It is bright and sunny.
     
     INT. MR SCOTT'S CLASSROOM - DAY
     
     Mr Scott, who is black, presides over his class. Marcus is 
     reading from his story, Vi at his side. Catherine, a stunning 
     intellectual, sits near the teacher. The rest of the students 
     (Amy, Elli, etc.) listen closely and take notes.
     
                    MARCUS
          "...but when he saw her...it was      
          as if he could walk like a 
          normal person. His legs didn't      
          swing, his arms didn't spaz 
          away...He wasn't a freak any more, 
          for she made him forget his 
          affliction. No more cerebral      
          palsy! From now on  "CP" stood 
          for...cerebral person. He was a      
          cerebral person.
               
     Pause. Marcus and Vi exchange looks.
     
                    AMY
          I thought it was really good,      
          Marcus...Really moving and 
          emotional.
                    
                    ELLI
          Yeah, I thought it was really      
          emotional, too.
     
                    AMY
          And I mean, really good word      
          choices. It kind of reminded me a 
          little of Faulkner, but East Coast 
          and disabled.
     
                    LUCY
          Or Flannery O'Connor. She had      
          multiple sclerosis.
     
                    JOYCE
          And Borges. He was blind.
                    
     Pause.
     
                    ETHAN
          Updike has psoriasis.
     
     Pause.
     
                    CATHERINE
          Um...Maybe I'm wrong, but, um, I'm 
          afraid I found the whole thing to      
          be a little trite. Its earnestness 
          is, well...it's a little      
          embarrassing. And those 
          adjectives, they're a little      
          flatfooted. And redundant. I'm      
          sorry, but...Anyway, what do I      
          know? Don't even listen to what I      
          say. I mean...
               
     Pause.
     
                    MR SCOTT
          Anyone else?
               
     No response.
     
                    MR SCOTT
          Catherine is right. The story's a      
          piece of shit. You express nothing 
          but banalities and, formally      
          speaking, are unable to construct      
          a single compelling sentence. You      
          ride on a wave of clichés so worn, 
          in fact, it actually approaches a      
          level of grotesquerie. Ad your      
          subtitle, 'the rawness of truth'      
          is that supposed to be a joke of      
          some sort? Or are you just being      
          pretentious?
               (beat; then checking his class book) 
          OK. Who's next?
     
     EXT. CAMPUS COURTYARD - DAY
     
     Marcus, upset, rushes outside, Vi in pursuit, desperately trying to 
     console.
     
                    VI
          Marcus, wait up!
               
     Marcus stops.
     
                    MARCUS
          What do you want?
               
                    VI
          Don't be so upset. It's OK...
               
                    MARCUS
          What the fuck are you talking      
          about? What's OK?
               
                    VI
               (beat)
          You know he hated my story also.
               
                    MARCUS
          Your story was terrible!
               
     He moves on, she keeps up with him.
     
                    VI
          Marcus...You'll write something      
          better next time!
               
                    MARCUS
          Patronizing fuck! If you had just      
          been honest with me in the first      
          place I wouldn't have read it. I      
          knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I 
          believed you!
     
                    VI
          That's not fair! I was honest!      
          Just because I wasn't sucking up      
          like      that bitch Catherine.
     
                    MARCUS
          Well, I sure didn't hear you voice 
          your opinion in there when it      
          mattered.
                         
                    VI
          I admit it - I was scared! I was      
          shocked, in fact , by what he      
          said. And he's so...convincing.      
          I'm sorry if I let you down, but      
          really, I still say he's just      
          one opinion. I don't even like his 
          books that much. They're all so      
          aggressively confrontational. I      
          don't care if he's won the      
          Pulitzer Prize.
     
     Catherine and Mr Scott walk by together in the distance.
     
                    MARCUS
          You just want to fuck him. Like      
          Catherine and every other white      
          cunt on campus.
               
     He leaves her.
     
     INT. VI AND MELINDA'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Melinda lies on her bed with some homework, watching Vi.
     
                    VI (O.S)
               (on phone)
          ...But Marcus! You can't just      
          unilaterally decide to end things. 
          This is a relationship we're      
          talking about! A friendship! You      
          don't just...Fuck you!
     
     She hangs up and enters her bedroom, in tears.
     
                    VI(cont'd)
          Fuck him! Fuck him! Fuck him...
               
                    MELINDA
          Vi? Are you OK?
               
                    VI
          Yes. I'm OK. I'm totally OK.
               
     Melinda rises, puts a hand on her shoulder.
     
                    MELINDA
          You did the right thing.
               
                    VI
          I know that. Fucking cripple. Why      
          do I waste my time with      
          undergrads? They're all      
          so...juvenile! Uch! I just thought 
          Marcus would be different. I      
          mean he's got CP!
     
     Pause.
     
                    MELINDA
          What are you gonna do now?
               
                    VI
          I dunno...go to a bar...get      
          laid...whatever...Don't worry      
          about me. I'll be fine...
     
     She starts changing into a new outfit.
     
     EXT. BAR - NIGHT
     
     Students hang around outside. Vi goes inside. 
     
     INT. BAR - NIGHT
     
     Vi walks up to the bar.
     
                    VI
          Can I have a beer? 
               
     After getting her beer, Vi turns around and suddenly notices Mr Scott, 
     who is sitting alone. She goes over to him.
     
                    VI(cont'd)
          Hi.
               
                    MR SCOTT
          Hello, Vi.
               
                    VI
          What are you doing here?
               
                    MR SCOTT
          What are you doing here?
               
     
                    VI
          I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just      
          didn't expect to run into you      
          here, that's all.
     
                    MR SCOTT
          Well, now you have.
               
     Vi laughs, sort of, ten blushes.
     
                    VI
          Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
               
                    MR SCOTT
          Uh huh.
               
                    VI
          Can I join you?
               
     Mr Scott gestures for her to sit down with him.
     
                    VI(cont'd)
          Gee, thanks. Well, um...I just      
          wanted to say that I'm really      
          happy with the class and,      
          um...I know you must here this all 
          the time, but I'm also a      
          great admirer of your work. A      
          Sunday Lynching,      
          especially...really, um spoke to      
          me. God, I hope I'm not      
          embarrassing you...
                                   
                    MR SCOTT
          You're not.
               
                    VI
          Good.
               (beat)
          'Cause I...um...I really agreed      
          with everything you had to say      
          last week about how bad my story      
          was...
               
                    MR SCOTT
          That's good.
               
                    VI
          And I also agreed with what you      
          said today about Marcus's story.      
          It is a piece of shit.
               
     Pause.
     
                    MR SCOTT
          You have beautiful skin.
               
                    VI
          Thank you.
               (beat)
          So Catherine seems like she might      
          become a really good writer.
     
                    MR SCOTT
          Maybe. She's OK.
               
     Pause.
     
                    VI
          Aren't you going out with      
          Catherine?
               (beat)
          I'm sorry. It's none of my      
          business. I didn't mean...
     
                    MR SCOTT
          I'm not 'going out' with      
          Catherine.
     
                    VI
          Oh.
               (beat)
          Do you think I have a potential as 
          a writer?
     
                    MR SCOTT
          No.
               
                    VI
          Thank you for being honest.
               
     Mr Scott leans over and touches her hand.
     
                    VI
          I have so much respect for you.
               
     EXT. STREET - NIGHT
     
     Mr Scott and Vi walk together in silence.
     
     INT. MR SCOTT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
     
     Vi and Mr Scott enter. He turns around and looks at her. Pause.
     
                    VI
          Can I just freshen up for a      
          second?
     
     He indicates the direction of the bathroom.
     
                    MR SCOTT
          It's over there.
               
                    VI
          Thanks.
               
     INT. MR SCOTT'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
     
     Vi enters, locks the door behind her. She looks at herself in the 
     mirror, then notices a snapshot of Catherine: she is naked, legs open 
     wide. Other erotic photographs lie beneath Catherine's.
     
                    VI
               (to herself, almost chanting)
          Don't be a racist. Don't be a      
          racist. Don't be a racist...
     
     INT. MR SCOTT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     Vi emerges from the bathroom to find Mr Scott lounging on the bed.
     
                    VI
          It's a really nice place you have. 
          Is the rent high?
     
                    MR SCOTT
          Take off your top.
               
     She obliges.
     
                    MR SCOTT
          Now...take off the rest.
               
     She does, and he looks hard at her. Finally he rises.
     
                    MR SCOTT
          Turn around.
               
     She does.
     
                    MR SCOTT
          Bend over.
               
     He starts making love to her, from behind.
     
                    MR SCOTT(cont'd)
               (whispers)
          Say, 'nigger, fuck me.'
               
                    VI
          Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
               
                    MR SCOTT
          Say, Ni...
               
                    VI
          Ni...
               
                    MR SCOTT
          ...gger.
               
                    VI
          ...gger.
               
                    MR SCOTT
          Say, 'Nigger.'
               
                    VI
          Nigger.
               
                    MR SCOTT
          'Fuck me hard!'
               
                    VI
          Fuck me hard!
     
                    MR SCOTT
          Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
               
                    VI
          Nigger, fuck me hard!
               
                    MR SCOTT
          Again!
               
                    VI
          Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
               
                    MR SCOTT
          Again!!
               
                    VI
          NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
               
     EXT. MARCUS'S DORMITORY - NIGHT
     
     Lights are out.
     
     INT. MARCUS'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
     
     Marcus looks in the mirror, ponders his reflection.
     
                    MARCUS
          Freak.
               
     There is a soft knock at the door. He turns  away from the mirror and 
     opens it. Vi is there, teary-eyed, disheveled. 
     
                    VI
          Can I come in?
               
     They embrace.
     
                    MARCUS
          You're all...sweaty!
               
     INT. MR SCOTTS CLASSROOM - DAY
     
     Vi finishes reading her story to the class.
     
                    VI
          '...So John flipped her around and 
          slammed her against the wall. Jane 
          braced herself: she thought about      
          her mother. She thought about      
          Peter. She thought about God...and 
          rape. ''Say, 'Fuck me, nigger.      
          Fuck me hard.''' John's flesh      
          abraded her soft skin. There would 
          be marks. She acquiesced, and said 
          what he asked her to say, and did      
          what he asked her to do. She had      
          entered college with hope, with      
          dignity, but she would graduate as 
          a whore.'
     
     Silence.
     
                    AMY
          Why do people have to be so      
          ugly...write about such ugly      
          characters? It's perverted. I know 
          you all think I'm being prisssy,      
          but I don't care. I was brought up 
          in a certain way. And this      
          is...mean-spirited!
     
     Pause.
     
                    JOYCE
          Yeah, well, it did seem a little      
          affected. Like by using taboo      
          language you were trying to shock      
          us about the hollowness of your      
          characters.
     
                    ETHAN
          I think it was a little bit      
          racist.
               
                    ELLI
          It was completely racist, and      
          beyond that I felt deeply offended 
          as a      woman. As if a woman can      
          only operate from experiences of      
          objectification.
     
                    SUE
          Totally phallocentric.
               
                    ELLI
          And so weirdly misogynistic. I      
          mean, why does Jane go through      
          with this? Is she stupid?
               
                    ETHAN
          Hey, But wasn't this a rape? Or      
          ...did I miss something? Because I 
          - I'm confused. Because if this      
          was a rape, then why would she be      
          a whore?
                                   
                    CATHERINE
               (beat)
          It was confessional, yet      
          dishonest. Jane pretends to be      
          horrified by      the sexuality that      
          she in fact fetishizes. She      
          subsumes herself to the myth of      
          black male potency, but then      
          doesn't follow through. She thinks 
          she 'respects Afro-Americans,' she 
          thinks they're 'cool,' 'exotic,'      
          what a notch he 'd make in her 
          belt, but, of course, it all comes 
          down to mandingo cliché, and he      
          calls her on it. In classic racist 
          tradition she demonizes, then runs 
          for cover. But then, how could she 
          behave otherwise? She's just a      
          spoiled suburban white girl with a 
          Benneton rainbow complex. It's      
          just my opinion, and what do I      
          know...but I think it's a callow      
          piece of writing.
     
                    MR SCOTT
          Callow and coy. Jane wants more,      
          but isn't honest enough to admit      
          it. In the end, she returns to the 
          safety of her crippled      
          (translation: sexually impotent)      
          boyfriend.
     
                    MARCUS
          This is bullshit! Her story was      
          the truth!
               
                    JOYCE
          Right.
               
                    SUE
          It's unbelievable!
               
                    ELLI
          It's clichéd!
               
                    AMY
          It's disgusting!
               
                    VI
          But it happened!
               
     Silence.
     
                    MR SCOTT
          I don't know about 'what      
          happened,' Vi, because once you      
          start writing, it  all becomes      
          fiction. Still, it certainly is an 
          improvement over your last story:      
          There is now at least a beginning, 
          a middle, and an end.
     
     TITLE CARD: 'NONFICTION'
     
     INT. TOBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
     
     A Lower East Side tenement apartment. A dogma '95 poster hangs above 
     the bed.
     
     Toby, down and out and in his thirties, leafs through his high-school 
     yearbook. He reads an inscription: 'Toby, I just know you're going to 
     become a movie star! Please don't forget me when you make it to the 
     top! I will always love you - Pam'.
     
     He picks up his phone and dials.
     
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Hello?
               
                    TOBY
          Hello, is this Pam?
               
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Who is this?
               
                    TOBY
          Toby Oxman.
               
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
               
                    TOBY
          Oh, fine. How are you?
               
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Great!
               
                    TOBY
          Great!
               
                    PAM (V.O.)
          So what's going on?
               
                    TOBY
          That's what I was gonna ask you.
               
                    PAM (V.O.)
          But...you called.
               
                    TOBY
          Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just      
          calling because, well, I was      
          wondering if you still remembered      
          me, which I guess you do...
     
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Yeah.
               
     Pause.
     
                    TOBY
          So. Look at where we are: the year 
          2000! Can you believe it? I mean,      
          did you ever think we would      
          actually make it?
          
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Um, well, yeah.
               (beat)
          So are you still acting?
               
                    TOBY
          Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I      
          kind of came to terms with myself, 
          I realized I had done what I had      
          to do. And it was time to move on.
     
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Oh. So what did you do after you      
          gave up on acting?
               
                    TOBY
          Well, I went to law school, if you 
          can believe that.
     
     Mike, Toby's roommate and cameraman, enters looking for a towel, then 
     goes to take a shower.
     
                    PAM (V.O.)
          I believe it.
               
                    TOBY
          Yeah, well, it was really all kind 
          of a joke - and a rip-off, so,      
          uh...so I dropped out.
                         
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Oh, that's too bad.
               
                    TOBY
          Yeah, well, then it got me      
          writing, so that was a good thing.
               
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Anything I might know about?
               
                    TOBY
          Well, um, I kind of let things go      
          on this novel I'd been really into 
          - I mean, the whole publishing      
          industry is totally corrupt. I      
          mean, really, it's finished.
     
                    PAM (V.O.)
          That's too bad.
               
                    TOBY
          I worked over at a homeless      
          shelter for a while, drove a cab      
          to pay the rent, but, I mean, that 
          was like - I mean, I have some      
          dignity. 
               
                    PAM (V.O.)
          That's good. So then what do you      
          do now?
     
                    TOBY
          I'm a documentary filmmaker.
               
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Oh? Anything I might have seen?
               
                    TOBY
          N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a      
          grant for this one project on      
          teenagers. Geez, remember when we      
          were teenagers?
     
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to      
          the prom.
     
                    TOBY
          Oh, I don't remember that...
               
                    PAM (V.O.)
          I do.
               
                    TOBY
          Well, but it was so long ago. We      
          were so different back then...
     
     No response.
     
                    TOBY (CONT'D)
          Uh, well, anyway, so I'm looking      
          for subjects for this documentary      
          on teenage life in suburbia. Kind      
          of an exploration of the mental      
          psyche of its mythology. I wrote      
          to Derrida to see if he'd like to      
          do the narration. But everything's 
          still kind of in development at      
          this point.
     
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Hunh.
     
                    TOBY(beat)
          I work in a shoe store right now.      
          But it's cool. I'm not ashamed. I      
          mean, really, I have a much      
          stronger sense of self now. And,      
          uh, anyways, it's really very      
          temporary.
     
                    PAM (V.O.)
          That's good.
               
                    TOBY
          Yeah...um...so anyway, tell me.      
          What about you? I'd heard through      
          the grapevine you were producing      
          movies.
     
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Yeah. But not any more.
               
                    TOBY
          Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast      
          lane'?
     
     No response.
     
                    TOBY (CONT'D)
          Yeah...So you're um...you're      
          married?
     
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Yeah.
               
                    TOBY
          Huh. Kids?
               
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Yeah.
               
                    TOBY
          How many?
               
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Three.
               
                    TOBY
          Great. How old are they?

          Wow, that really is great. In a      
          few years, who knows, maybe      
          they'll want to be in my      
          documentary!

     Pause.
     
                    PAM (V.O.)
          Listen, Toby, I can't really talk      
          right now. Do you mind if I call      
          you back?
     
                    TOBY
          Yeah, sure.
               
                    PAM (V.O.)
          OK. Bye.
               
                    TOBY
               (to himself, after pause)
          Maybe she has caller ID.

     It is bright and shiny.
     
                    MR. DEMARCO (V.O.)
          Do you have any hobbies?
               
     INT. MR. DEMARCO'S OFFICE - DAY
     
     Scooby, seventeen, and Mr DeMarco, the guidance counselor, sit opposite 
     each other.
     
                    SCOOBY
          No, not really.
               
                    MR. DEMARCO
          Any books you like to read for      
          fun?
          
                    SCOOBY
          No.
               
                    MR. DEMARCO
          None at all? How about those      
          'underground' comics?
                
                    SCOOBY
          I hate reading.
               
                    MR. DEMARCO
               (beat)
          All right, Scooby, let's not beat      
          around the bush. With your      
          attitude, you're not going to get      
          in anywhere.
     
                    SCOOBY
          OK.
               
                    MR. DEMARCO
          'OK.' So you just don't care.
               (beat)
          Let me ask you, not as your      
          guidance counselor, but...as a      
          friend: what do you want to      
          do with your life? I mean, what      
          kind of long-term goals can you      
          possibly have?
     
                    SCOOBY
          I dunno...
               
                    MR. DEMARCO
          C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what      
          you're thinking.
     
                    SCOOBY
          Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV.      
          Maybe have a talk show or      
          something. Like Conan. Or early      
          Letterman.
     
                    MR. DEMARCO
          Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to      
          achieve this goal?

                    SCOOBY
          I dunno. See if I have any      
          connections.

     The sprinkler system is still on.
     
     INT. DINING ROOM – EVENING
     
     The family is sitting waiting at the table: FERN, Scooby's attractive 
     mother; MARTY, his bullish father; BRADY, sixteen, his handsome jock 
     brother; and MIKEY, ten his smart youngest brother.
     
     CONSUELO, the maid, brings some bread to the table.
     
                    FERN
          Did you knock on his door?
               
                    MICKEY
          Yes, but he just shouted at me and 
          used the f-word.
     
                    MARTY
          Scooby! Dinner!
               
     No response. Pause.
     
                    MICKEY
          Would anyone be interested in      
          being hypnotized after dinner?
     
                    FERN/MARTY/BRADY
          No.
               
     Pause.
     
                    FERN
          Let's just start.
               
     They eat.
     
                    MARTY
          I don't know what's wrong with      
          that kid.
     
                    BRADY
          Maybe he's gay.
               
                    MARTY
          Don't ever say that.
               
                    BRADY
          What if he is?
               
                    MARTY
          He isn't.
               
                    FERN
          Marty, ignore him.
               
                    BRADY
          He's vegetarian, doesn't do      
          sports...
     
                    MARTY
          Brady!
               
     Pause.
     
                    FERN
          And even if he is...
               
     Pause.
     
                    MIKEY
          Gay people are people too, you      
          know. You're just being      
          prejudiced.
                                   
                    BRADY
          I don't care is he's gay. I'm      
          cool. I mean, it's not like I have 
          to share his room or anything.
     
                    MARTY
          I just want to know what the hell      
          he's doing in his room that's so      
          interesting he doesn't come down      
          for dinner.
               
                    MIKEY
          Maybe he's building a bomb...just      
          like-!
               
                    FERN
          Don't even joke about that!
               
                    MIKEY
          I'm serious! What happens if he      
          blows up the school?
     
     A tense pause, followed by a distant crushing sound.
     
                    SCOOBY (O.S.)
          Fuck!
               
                    MARTY 
          I'm going in there.
               
     Scooby appears.
     
                    SCOOBY
          Was anyone in my room today?
               
                    FERN
          Is everything OK?
               
                    SCOOBY
          My CD case like totally collapsed. 
          I'm gonna have to recatalogue all      
          weekend. 
               (sitting down)
          Hey. Can you pass the salad over.
               
                    MARTY

          Steak's really good tonight.
                    SCOOBY
               (beat)
          Good.
               
                    FERN
          Got a lot of homework?
               
                    SCOOBY
          I dunno.
               
                    MARTY
          Whaddya mean you don't know? You      
          either got a lot or you don't.      
          What's not to know?
     
                    FERN

          You started filling out your      
          college applications yet?
     
                    SCOOBY
          I'm not going to college.
               
     Pause.
     
                    FERN
          What are you going to do?
               
                    SCOOBY
          I dunno.
               
                    MARTY
          What DO you know?
               
                    SCOOBY
          Dad, I'm trying to figure things      
          out right now, OK? It's like,      
          really hard, and I'm just      
          listening to some old Elton John      
          and...
               
     Brady mouths: 'Gay!'
     
                    MARTY
          Out! Leave the table!
               
                    BRADY
          What?
               
                    MARTY
          You heard me: leave the table!
               
                    BRADY
               (rising)
          Man, I am out of here! This family 
          is so fucked!
     
     Brady leaves.
     
                    MIKEY
          Mom, it's not fair if Brady can      
          say the f-word and I can't.
     
                    MARTY
          Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up.      
          Cause here's a lesson: life's not      
          fair.

     A red sports car drives up front. Esposito, Brady's buddy, drops off 
     Brady and Cheryl, Brady's cheerleader girlfriend.
     
     A cleaning woman walks along the sidewalk on her way to the bus stop.
     
                    BRADY
          I'll talk to you later, man!

     Mikey sits on the sofa while Consuelo continues her housework.
     
                    MIKEY
          Consuelo?
               
                    CONSUELO
          Yes, Mikey?
               
                    MIKEY
          Do you have any brothers or      
          sisters?
     
                    CONSUELO
          Yes.
               
                    MIKEY
          Really? How many?
               
                    CONSUELO
          Four brothers and five sisters.
               
                    MIKEY
          Wow.
               (beat)
     Why did your parents have so many      
     children? I mean, if they were 
     poor, wouldn't it be better to 
     have just one or two?
               
                    CONSUELO
          It was God's will.
               
                    MIKEY
          But do you really believe in God?      
          And heaven, hell and angels and

          So? How was school today?
               
                    SCOOBY
          The same.
               
                    MARTY
          The same. Same as what?
               
                    SCOOBY
          Just the same.
               
     A tense pause.
     
                    BRADY
          We're studying the Holocaust in      
          Social Studies.
     
                    MARTY
          Oh, yeah?
               
                    SCOOBY
          We did the same thing last year      
          also.
     
                    FERN
          How was the class?
               
                    BRADY
          Well, I'm supposed to watch      
          Schindler's List for homework. The 
          movie's like almost four hours.      
          And then I'm supposed to write a      
          report on survivors.
               (to Marty)
          You know any survivors, Dad?
               
                    MARTY 
          Hmmm...Do I know      
          any...personally...?
     
                    FERN
          Well, technically your Zeda is a      
          survivor.
     
                    BRADY
          He was in a concentration camp?
               
                    FERN
          Well, no. But he had to escape the 
          Nazis.
     
                    BRADY
          But I thought he came over to      
          America before the war.
               
                    FERN
          Well, he did. With his family. But 
          his cousins, they had to stay and      
          they were all killed. And if he'd      
          stayed, he would have been killed. 
          So in my book he's a survivor.
     
                    BRADY
          Even though it was only his      
          cousins that were killed?
               
                    FERN
          But that could've happened to him. 
          Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or      
          you.
     
                    MIKEY
          Or me?
               
                    SCOOBY
          You mean, then, we're all      
          survivors?
     
                    FERN
          Well...yes. If it hadn't been for      
          Hitler, he wouldn't have had to      
          leave Europe. We would have      
          been...European.
               
                    SCOOBY
          But then, in a sense, since you      
          would never have met Dad if your      
          family had stayed in Europe...if      
          it weren't for Hitler, none of us      
          would have been born.
               
     A long pause.

                    MR KIRK
          Tell me: you make a living at      
          this?
     
                    TOBY
          Well, sir...uh...I'm actually not      
          doing this for the money. When you 
          make a documentary, you do it for      
          many reasons, but money is      
          certainly not one of them.
     
                    MR KIRK
          I don't get it.
               
                    TOBY
          Well, sir, a lot has happened to      
          the landscape of the suburban high 
          school since I was a student, and      
          I feel it would be a valuable,      
          perhaps even enlightening      
          endeavor, to chronicle the      
          changes, to get intimate with the      
          realities kids and parents face in 
          American schools today.
     
                    MR KIRK
          Yeah, well, whatever. I'll let you 
          know if there's interest.

          filmmaker?

          Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch      
          Project?
     
                    TOBY
          Well, no. I'm doing one on high      
          school students, in fact.
     
                    SCOOBY
          What for?
               
                    TOBY
          Well...it's kind of a sociological 
          study in the aftermath of      
          Columbine.
     
                    SCOOBY
          Is this to like get into Sundance?
               
                    TOBY
          Yeah, well, it's possible they      
          would be interested in it.
               
                    SCOOBY
          Doubt it.
               
                    TOBY
          Actually, there is some interest      
          from the Sundance Channel.

          Which is it? You gotta keep your      
          focus straight.
               
                    TOBY
          You're absolutely right. The focus 
          is on the college admissions      
          process today.
     
     Pause.

          Scooby and a few other students of

          'Cause Scooby does have a quality      
          that I've been looking for, a      
          quality that is emblematic of

          Mr Livingston, I fully understand      
          and I share your concerns. You      
          fell vulnerable. And I know that      
          this is a very difficult question, 
          but what it comes down to is: can      
          you make a leap of faith in me, in 
          the same way that I have to make a 
          leap of faith in you?

          people are really cool, like the      
          teachers and kids...they really      
          care and all. And I know that they

          Walking down these hallways just      
          like the ones I once walked down      
          as a teenager, I couldn't help      
          thinking back to a time when every 
          day I woke up depressed, suicidal, 
          consumed by despair. Had things      
          changed? Was the competition to      
          get into the most prestigious      
          schools still a requisite rite of      
          passage? Beneath these masks of      
          courtesy and friendliness I knew      
          that there were darker forces at      
          work...and I knew that Scooby was      
          the key to revealing the truth...

          The pressure to get into the      
          college of your choice is      
          incredible. You know, they did a      
          study recently of the youth in      
          Bosnia during the bombing, and      
          they found that the stress the      
          young people experienced there was 
          less than what American high-
          school students go through when      
          applying to college.

          idiotic these people are.

                    TOBY
          OK. How about you, Cheryl? Were      
          you surprised?
     
                    CHERYL
          I dunno. Whatever.
               
                    TOBY
          Hmm.
               
                    BRADY
          Hey, how come you drive such a      
          shitty car?
     
                    CHERYL
          Yeah.
               
                    TOBY
               (joins their laughter)
          I don't know...That's interesting, 
          though. A cool car. Is that      
          something that's real important to 
          you, Brady?
     
                    BRADY
          Yeah.
               
                    CHERYL
          Uh duh.
               
     INT. SCOOBY'S BEDROOM – DAY
     
     Scooby handles a gun his friend Stanley has given him.
     
                    SCOOBY
          Pretty cool, Stanley.
               
                    STANLEY
          Thanks.
               
                    SCOOBY
          How'd you get it?
               
                    STANLEY
          It's my Dad's He hides it under      
          some old TV Guides in his closet.
     
                    SCOOBY
          Gee, your Dad's smart.
               
                    STANLEY
          I know.
               
                    SCOOBY
          Is it loaded?
               
                    STANLEY
          No, I don't think so...
               
     Scooby points it at his head.
     
                    STANLEY
          Scooby, don't! Be careful!
               
                    SCOOBY
          I'm not an idiot, man. I watch TV.
               
                    STANLEY 
          I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a      
          little nervous, I don't know why.
     
                    SCOOBY
          You should be.
               
     Scooby points it at Stanley, gets a terrified reaction, then tosses the 
     gun aside.
     
                    SCOOBY
          Here. You can keep it.
               
     He lies down. Pause.
     
                    STANLEY 
          Scooby?
               
                    SCOOBY
          Yeah?
               
                    STANLEY 
          You know...I like you.
               
                    SCOOBY
          Yeah. I know.
               
                    STANLEY 
          I mean...
               
                    STANLEY 
          I know. Everyone knows.
               
                    STANLEY 
          Oh.
               (beat)
          Do you think that you'd let      
          me...um...
     
     Pause.
     
                    SCOOBY
          OK. If you feel like it. Just give 
          me a second.
     
     He pulls a bag of mushrooms out from beneath his night table, takes 
     some and offers to Stanley.
     
                    SCOOBY
          You want some?
               
                    STANLEY
          No, thanks.
               
     Scooby flicks on a CD, then lies down.
     
     DREAM SEQUENCE – EXT. LIVINGSTON HOME – DAY
     
     While Stanley goes down on Scooby, the camera pans away from Scooby to 
     reveal Marty and Fern being burned at the stake in the front yarn, 
     writhing and screaming in agony.
     
                    MARTY
          I'm so sorry! I should never have      
          made you take the SATs!
     
     The camera then pans to reveal Conan O'Brien approaching.
     
                    CONAN
          Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
               
                    SCOOBY
          Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you      
          doing here?
     
                    CONAN
          I'm looking for a last-minute      
          guest for my show. Any      
          suggestions?
     
                    SCOOBY
          I'll be your guest!
               
                    CONAN
          Really? Well, all right! Let's      
          take a look at the television and      
          see how we look.
     
     The camera pans to reveal a TV standing on the lawn.
     
                    SCOOBY
          Cool!
               
     Conan turns on the TV and we move inside it to see Conan and Scooby 
     sharing some talk-show patter and repartee.
     
                    CONAN
          Welcome to the show, Scooby.
               
                    SCOOBY
          Thank you.
               
                    CONAN
          Nice to have you here.
               
                    SCOOBY
          Great to be here.
               
                    CONAN
          And thank you for dressing up for      
          us. This is very classy. Tell us.      
          What kind of professional plans do 
          you have? What's in your future?
     
                    SCOOBY 
          Well, I was thinking...I might      
          work for you.

                    CONAN
          Ahh...tell me. What do you want to 
          do for me? What's your idea?
     
                    SCOOBY 
          Be your sidekick, you know, and      
          maybe eventually become a TV talk-
          show host.
     
                    CONAN
          TV talk-show host, OK. You were at 
          sidekick eight seconds ago, then      
          TV talk-show host. You'll be a      
          Latin dictator in a bout a minute.
     
     Audience laughter.
     
                    CONAN
          Let's see what they think of the      
          first idea. I'm curious      
          what the audience thinks. Folks,      
          what do you think: should Scooby      
          be my new sidekick?
               
     Audience cheers.
     
                    CONAN
          Scooby, new sidekick, everybody!
               
     Bigger round of applause.
     
     RETURN TO REALITY: INT. CHILDREN'S BATHROOM – NIGHT
     
     Scooby has spaced out while flossing. There is a knock at the door.
     
                    SCOOBY
          Yeah?
               
     Brady enters.
     
                    BRADY
          Hey.
               
                    SCOOBY
          Hey. What's up?
               
                    BRADY
          There's something I need to talk      
          about with you.
     
                    SCOOBY
          What?
               
                    BRADY
          There are some rumors...
               
                    SCOOBY
          Like what?
               
                    BRADY
          You know...Stanley...
               
                    SCOOBY
          Oh.
               
                    BRADY
          And like, don't take this the      
          wrong way...I mean, I'm      
          cool...but...you 
          know...I've got a good reputation      
          at school and, well...I really      
          don't want it ruined.
     
     He is visibly upset. Pause.
     
                    SCOOBY
          No prob. I'm cool.
               
                    BRADY
          Thanks, Scoob.
               
     EXT. HIGH-SCHOOL PLAYING FIELD – DAY
     
     A football scrimmage is in progress. A play ends, and the Coach comes 
     on to the field, barking:
     
                    COACH
          Esposito, What the fuck do you      
          think you're doing? You're      
          tackling like a bitch 
          on my football team, son! You      
          gotta bend your ass over and hit      
          somebody! You understand me? 
     
                    ESPOSITO
          Yes, sir!
               
                    COACH
          You understand me?
               
                    ESPOSITO
          Yes, sir!
               
                    COACH
          Then do it!...Livingston! That's      
          the way to hit that hole, son!
     
     Brady waves a Cheryl in the stands.
     
                    COACH
          We're gonna become a football team 
          today, guys! Let's move the ball!      
          Move! Move! Move! I wanna see you      
          hit those holes! Defense, fill      
          those goddam gaps! Let's go, guys! 
          Let's do it!...
     
     On the next play Brady runs to catch a pass, but is moved down by 
     Esposito 
     shouting, 'KILL HIM!!!'
     
     Cheryl jumps up, alarmed.
     
     O.S. cheerleaders finish their 'Go Bucks!' cheer, but Brady doesn't 
     rise.
     
     INT. HOSPITAL ICU – EVENING
     
     Brady lies unconscious in bed, hooked up to machines. Marty, Fern, 
     Scooby, and Cheryl stand around him.
     
     INT. LIVINGSTON HOME – NIGHT
     
     Mikey sits at the kitchen table with Consuelo. He is eating ice cream.
     
                    MIKEY
          When I'm in high school I'm not      
          going to play any football. I'm      
          just going to concentrate on class 
          rank.
               (beat)
          What did you do in high school?
               
                    CONSUELO
          I did not go to high school.
               
                    MIKEY
          Weren't there high schools in El      
          Salvador?
     
                    CONSUELO
          We had to work. My family was      
          poor.
     
                    MIKEY
          Must've been hard being poor.
               
                    CONSUELO
          I'm still poor.
               
                    MIKEY
          Hmmm.
               (beat)
          But, Consuelo, even though your      
          poor, don't you have any hobbies      
          or interests or anything?
     
                    CONSUELO
          No, Mikey.
               
                    MIKEY
          But like, what do you like to do      
          when you're not working?
     
                    CONSUELO
          I'm always working.
               
                    MIKEY
          But when you're not. Like now.      
          What do you like to do?
     
                    CONSUELO
          This is work.
               
                    MIKEY
          But it's not like real work. This      
          is just babysitting.
     
     Consuelo stares hard at him in silence.
     
                    MIKEY
          You know, your job's really not so 
          bad, if you think about it. You      
          should smile more often.
     
     ON VIDEO: DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE OF:
     
     (1) Driving-along-the-neighborhood shots; a lam post; a sign; a 
     floating straw wrapper.
     
                    TOBY (V.O.)
          When the sky is clear and the sun      
          is warm, you're reminded of how      
          beautiful things can be: a lamp      
          post, a sign, a straw wrapper      
          blowing in the wind…But when that      
          dark cloud appears, you realize      
          how fragile the balance of life      
          is.
     
     (2) The neurologist Dr Barry Jordan discussing Brady's condition:
     
                    DR JORDAN
          When Brady first arrived at the      
          hospital he was unresponsive to      
          verbal stimuli. Wee performed a CT 
          scan which demonstrated a large      
          subdural hemotoma with mass      
          effect. Since the removal of the      
          subdural he's been in coma.
     
     (3) A psychologist discussing the effect of the Brady crisis on his 
     family:
     
                    DR GOODMAN
          When I first met the Livingstons      
          it was in the first twenty four      
          hours of Brady coming in after his 
          tragic football accident and they      
          were acting in a fairly typical      
          way…
     
     (4) The Livingstons consulting with Dr Goodman in a hospital waiting 
     room:
     
                    MARTY
          We're not the ones who need the      
          help. My son needs help.
     
                    DR GOODMAN 
          And you-
               
                    MARTY 
          My son's in there! He can't even      
          feed himself, he can't eat – I      
          don't even know if he's going to      
          be a vegetable or not, for      
          Chrissake!
     
     The picture freezes and then zooms into a close up on Scooby.
     
                    TOBY (V.O.)
          But what about Scooby? How would      
          this effect him? What meaning is      
          to be found in this?
               
     INT. EDITING ROOM – DAY
     
     Toby and his editor finish watching this latest footage.
     
                    EDITOR
          This is definitely better.
               
                    TOBY
          You think so? You don't think that 
          this might not be a little dry?
     
                    EDITOR
          This is entertainment you're      
          making, Toby. This story about a      
          kid in the suburbs and the state      
          of the college admissions process      
          has, with this Brady crisis,      
          evolved into something much richer 
          and more provocative.
     
                    TOBY
          Yes, I know…But still, it should      
          be somewhat entertaining.

          I mean, without this footage,      
          without this rigorous      
          documentation, it would feel      
          like exploitation.
     
                    TOBY
          No, no, no. No exploitation. This      
          is serious…But don't you find it a 
          little funny too, at the same      
          time?

          You've got a family tragedy on      
          your hands. Will you tell me      
          what's funny about that? About a      
          kid in a coma?

          I mean, why are you making this      
          documentary if you can't treat      
          your subject with appropriate      
          gravity?

          OK, you're right, you're right…

          You know, we need to screen what      
          we've got…invite some regular      
          people, just some random off-the-
          street types…and see what real      
          people think of this.
     
                    EDITOR
          I dunno, Toby. We really have a      
          long way to go. You still need a      
          lot more footage, and it's      
          probably a little premature to      
          start screening…
     
                    TOBY
          OK, then we can invite serious      
          intellectual types.

                    MARTY
          Mikey, there's optimism, and then      
          there's stupidity. It's a very      
          fine line.
               
     Pause.
     
                    MIKEY 
          I don't think there's any hope,      
          either. I was just trying to make

          Dad?…Would you let me try      
          hypnotizing you now?
     
                    MARTY
          Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
               
                    MIKEY
          OK. Stay there. I'll be right      
          back.
     
     Mikey hurries off to fetch his hypnotizing apparatus. Marty sits and 
     waits. 
     
                    MIKEY
          Just a sec!…Be right there!
               
     Mikey returns, sets himself up across from Marty and takes out a shiny 
     object.
     
                    MIKEY
          Dad, can you turn around a bit,      
          please?
     
     Marty obliges.
     
                    MIKEY
          Thanks. All right. Now you must      
          look at this shiny object and      
          concentrate. Relax your legs.      
          Relax your arms. Relax your      
          shoulders. Now keep your eyes on      
          the shiny object…Your eyelids      
          are getting heavy…heavier…You're      
          getting sleepy…sleepier…Now let      
          your eyes close shut…and you      
          are asleep.
     
     Marty's head drops.
     
                    MIKEY
          Now you are completely under my      
          power. I am the only voice you can 
          hear, the only voice you will      
          listen to. Now. When you wake up      
          you will be in a good mood. You      
          won't worry so much about Brady.      
          And I will be your favorite from      
          now on. If Brady dies, you can be      
          sad for a little bit, but I will      
          still be the most important person 
          in your life. You will never be      
          mean to me, and always give me      
          whatever I want. Also, you should      
          fire Consuelo. She's lazy. Now      
          when I snap my fingers, you will      
          remember nothing, but you will do      
          everything I have asked. One. Two. 
          Three.
     
     Mikey snaps his fingers and Marty wakes up.

          past, but now we think maybe it's      
          time for a change…uh…I know you've 
          had trouble at home and maybe, you 
          know, some of that is reflected I      
          your work…
     
                    CONSUELO
          But, Mr Livingston, I work very      
          hard for you and your family!
     
                    MARTY
          I understand, I understand that,      
          and I'm sorry it had to end this      
          way.

                    MIKE
          Uh, no, he's not.
               
                    SCOOBY
          Oh. Do you have any idea where he

          I think Scooby's like a lot of      
          kids. He just hit a…a speed bump.      
          Now he's gonna find his way, his      
          path is gonna be cleared, and I      
          think he's gonna continue his      
          education at a good college. And      
          everybody else is gonna be happy.
                         
                    TOBY (O.S.)
          ...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a 
          bit fearful that Scooby will be      
          confronted with hollow values and      
          systemic conformism? 
     
     Pause.
     
                    MARTY
          I don't know why this is so hard      
          for you to comprehend. I had a      
          terrific time in college. I've got 
          a terrific job, a comfortable      
          salary, terrific wife, three      
          terrific kids…and every year I      
          give to the alumni fund. Now why      
          are you trying to make college out 
          to be a bad thing, a negative      
          experience? You were unhappy?      
          Well, to bad! Get over it! Stop      
          trying to impose your misery on      
          others by going around saying,      
          'Life is bad, life is horrible.'      
          Life is tough on you? Well, boo      
          hoo!
     
     ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE

                    SCOOBY
          ...Well, yeah, my Dad is kind of a 
          goofball. I just have to pretend      
          to go along with his ideas. 'Cause 
          he really doesn't get it: like I      
          could be the next Oprah, for all      
          he knows, but he's never even seen 
          the show.
     
     ANGLE ON SCOOBY
     
     ...watching himself on screen

     ...as he continues talking to Toby.
     
                    TOBY (O.S.)
          What is most important to you?
               
                    SCOOBY
          I dunno. I'd like to be good at      
          something. It doesn't have to be      
          TV. I mean, it could be      
          movies...Anything. I'd be willing      
          to direct.
     
     The audience laughs.
     
                    SCOOBY
          But I'd like to be, you      
          know...famous. Not necessarily a      
          superstar, just famous. Be      
          recognized. Get fan Mail.      
          Things...

     ...still talking to Toby.
      
                    TOBY (O.S.)
          Uh, Scooby, now I understand how      
          you want to be a TV talk-show host 
          and all, like Conan O'Brien, but      
          did you know even he went to      
          college?
     
                    SCOOBY
          He did?
               
                    TOBY (O.S.)
          Yeah. He went to Harward.
               
                    SCOOBY
               (beat)
          Oh.
               
     ANGLE ON SCOOBY
     
     ...watching the film and listening to the audience. The laughter is out 
     of control. He is devastated.

          Mom? Dad? Can I sleep with you?      
          I'm scared.
     
     They flick off the TV.
     
                    MARTY
          Sure!...
               
                    FERN
          Of course, honey. Come in bed with 
          us. Come on.
     
     Mikey gets in bed with them.
     
                    MARTY
          Snug as a bug in a rug. Yeah, here 
          you go, pal. All righty...You're      
          monster-proofed! 
                         
     EXT. LIVINGSTONE HOME - NIGHT
     
     Consuelo approaches the house stealthily.
     
     ANGLE ON FINGERS
     
     ...opening the back of the house;
     
     stuffing towels under bedroom doors;
     
     turning on the kitchen stove's gas;
     
     switching on the main gas valve in the boiler room.
