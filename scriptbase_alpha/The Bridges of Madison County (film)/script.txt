More info about this movie on IMDb.com


Our story begins in 1965, on a hot afternoon in August.

FADE IN

EXT. IOWA LANDSCAPE  - DAY

Rolling green hills, lush farmland, vast open space. Not a
house or sign of life in sight. On a long dusty road, a TRUCK
is driving across the screen. Clouds of dirt follow in its
tracks -- its motor, the only sound we hear.

INT. TRUCK - DAY

FRANCESCA JOHNSON is sitting in the front seat of the pick-up
truck. Her expression is distant. Her eyes are sad, as if
hiding a burden she can hardly bear. Her husband, RICHARD
JOHNSON, is driving.

          RICHARD
     You feeling better Franny?

          FRANCESCA
     Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I
     think.

He nods, satisfied. He turns on the radio as the VOICE OF
DINAH WASHINGTON sings a bluesy, haunting love song, "I'LL
CLOSE MY EYES."

          DINAH WASHINGTON
          (SINGS)
     "I'LL CLOSE MY EYES... TO EVERYONE
     BUT YOU... AND WHEN I DO... I'LL SEE
     YOU STANDING THERE..."
          (CONTINUES)

          RICHARD
          (surprised)
     What station is this?

          FRANCESCA
     It's a Chicago station. I found it
     the other day.

          RICHARD
     Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz
     kinda singing?

          FRANCESCA
          (nicely)
     I don't know. Can we turn it off? I
     have such a headache.

          RICHARD
     Sure.

Richard shuts it off. Francesca turns her face away from him
to look out at the vast expanse out of the countryside.

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY

The truck stops in front of an isolated FARM HOUSE. A wooden
gate stands twenty yards from the front door. A barn and a
hot house sits on either side, surrounded by acres and acres
of beautiful pasture.

CAROLYN JOHNSON, a sixteen-year-old girl, steps out from the
vegetable garden with an arm full of vegetable. She watches
her parents exit the truck.

Francesca carries her groceries, walking briskly through the
front gate and entering the house.

Richard grabs a bag of feed from the flatbed and strolls more
leisurely. When he walks through the front gate, he notices
something on the ground and picks it up. It is a BUTTON with
RED NATURAL surrounding it. As if it had been torn from a
piece of clothing. His daughter approaches him.

          RICHARD
     Your mother isn't feel well. I want
     you to help her out tonight with
     dinner.
          (she nods)
     Tell Michael to put this feed away.

He puts the feed bag down. She exits. He enters the house.

INT. FRONT HALL - DAY

Richard enters the front hall opposite the stairs to the
second floor. To his left is the living room. To his right,
through an archway is the kitchen. He moves towards the stair
when he suddenly hears the kitchen radio turned on and "I'LL
CLOSE MY EYES" continues. It puzzles him. He looks to the
kitchen. Francesca is obviously there but we can't see her.
He is about to call to her when his son, Michael, yells:

          MICHAEL (O.S.)
     Dad! You bought the wrong feed!

          RICHARD
          (irritated)
     What?!

He exits through the house to the back door.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

The family-- Francesca, Richard, Carolyn and their seventeen-
year-old son MICHAEL -- are eating supper. No one speaks.

          FRANCESCA
     So what are you going to do with the
     prize money?

          CAROLYN
     I don't know. I might save up for one
     of those hi-fi stereo players like
     Peggy has.

Francesca nods. Silence again. She asks her son:

          FRANCESCA
     Are you seeing Betty tonight?

          MICHAEL
          (eating)
     Nah.

Silence. She is used to her son's one syllable answers.

          RICHARD
     Oh! Frannie, is this yours?

He places the button with red material on the table. Hiding
her surprise, Francesca takes the button.

          FRANCESCA
     You found it! I got my dress caught
     on that damn gate. You must have eyes
     like a hawk.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     You must all be tired. You got home
     so early. What time did you leave
     Illinos this morning?

          RICHARD
     'Bout 4:30.

          FRANCESCA
     Well you should all go to bed early.
     I'll do the cleaning up.

This last remark she addresses to her daughter. Everyone
returns to their silent eating.

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

The house is asleep and dark except for a bright light coming
from the kitchen. Carolyn quietly exits her bedroom in her
nightclothes. She was awakened by noises coming from the
kitchen downstairs.

INT. KITCHEN -

She enters to find the lights are on. An empty cake pan and
a half-used bowl of frosting sitting unwashed in the sink.
She hears the motor of the truck being turned on. She moves
to the front hall and looks out through the door to see:

The truck driving away. She calls out:

          CAROLYN
     Mom!

But she gets no response. She stands there wondering where
her mother could possibly being going this time of night, as
we -

                              DISSOLVE TO:

THIRTY YEARS LATER - SAME LOCATION

Carolyn, thirty years older, stands in the same doorway of
the same house thinking back to that evening her mother acted
so strangely.

A LAWYER is unpacking a briefcase in the living room off the
front entrance.

Carolyn sees a car with Florida plates driving up to the
house. She smiles.

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY

Carolyn steps out of the doorway and heads for the car, out
of which exit her brother Michael and his country girl wife
BETTY, a stout buxom chatterbox. Both boast Florida tans and
fashion styles.

          MICHAEL
          (to Carolyn)
     Explain to me again why we didn't do
     this in Des Moines in an air
     conditioned office?

          CAROLYN
     Mom's orders.

          MICHAEL
     Lawyer here?

          CAROLYN
          (nods)
     I have some sandwich fixings if
     you're hungry.

          BETTY
          (proudly)
     No, we just had lunch at the hotel
     with my brother and his new wife. She
     told me all the dirt. I forgot how
     interesting things can get around
     here. It was so good to see them. The
     last time we visited they were in
     Europe. He is doing so well. He
     ordered champagne. For lunch! I
     nearly died.

          MICHAEL
     I nearly died when we split the bill.

          BETTY
     Michael doesn't understand. People
     who make the kind of money my brother
     makes don't carry money on them. They
     keep it all in various accounts.

          MICHAEL
     Then we should have had lunch at the
     bank.

Carolyn tries not to laugh. Betty shoots him a dirty look,
then stops to take in the house and its surroundings.

          BETTY
     Boy. It sure has been a long time.

          MICHAEL
          (correcting her)
     We were here two Christmases ago.

          BETTY
     Well, that's a long time.

          MICHAEL
     It's not that long.

          BETTY
          (suddenly upset)
     Well, why don't I just say black so
     you can say white!
          (to Carolyn)
     Don't be surprised to find your
     brother hasn't changed an iota. He
     hardly ever talks and when he does
     it's in that tone! You should have
     heard him at lunch -- not two words
     until the bill came and then he says,
     "Worth every penny."

          MICHAEL
          (defensive)
     SO!

          BETTY
          (angry)
     You said it in that tone! Like you
     were angry at me, my brother, at
     the world for forcing you to eat a
     nice lunch!

          MICHAEL
     Oh Jesus.

          BETTY
          (staring to cry)
     I simply can not stand that tone!

          CAROLYN
          (sympathetically)
     Come inside. You're just tired from
     the trip.

She comforts Betty who indulges in the attention.

          BETTY
     I am so sick and tired of apologizing
     and not knowing what I've done!

          CAROLYN
     I'm sure you haven't done anything.
     Have some iced tea. How are the kids?

          MICHAEL
     He dropped them off at Betty's mom.
     Where's Steve?

          CAROLYN
          (uncomfortably)
     He's not coming.

Betty suddenly stops crying and abrasively focuses on
Carolyn's problems.

          BETTY
     Aw, is he still cheating on you,
     hon?

Carolyn suddenly hoses sympathy for her.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

The lawyer hands Michael a document.

          LAWYER
     Just sign here as having received the
     contents from the safe deposit box.
          (Michael does)
     And this one, which clears the bank
     of all further responsibility fo0r the
     contents.

Betty whispers to Carolyn.

          BETTY
     This is kind of exciting. You think
     we'll find out your mother had
     secret millions lying around?

Carolyn smiles weakly. Michael hands back the papers.

          LAWYER
     All right. Why don't we begin.

He takes out Francesca's Last Will and Testament.

          LAWYER (cont'd)
     Your mother has been interred at
     Lakeside Funeral Home until
     arrangements can be made.

          MICHAEL
          (to Carolyn)
     I thought everything WAS arranged.

          CAROLYN
     Well, there's a problem.

          MICHAEL
     What problem?

          LAWYER
     Your mother left explicit
     instructions that she wished to be
     cremated.

          MICHAEL
     Cremated?!

          BETTY
     Eeeww!

          CAROLYN
     I know. I don't understand it either.

          MICHAEL
     When did she decide this?

          LAWYER
          (reading will)
     Apparently just before her death.

          MICHAEL
     Well, that's crazy. I don't know
     anybody who gets cremated.

          BETTY
     My Jewish friend's grandmother did.

          MICHAEL
     Well, no one in my family did! Dad
     bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge.
     One for him, one for mom.

          LAWYER
     It clearly states in the will --

          MICHAEL
     I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama
     was delirious, you know. She didn't
     know what she was saying. If she
     wanted to be cremated, why the hell
     did she let dad buy two plots, huh?

          LAWYER
     Well, she was very specific. She
     wanted her ashes to be thrown over
     Roseman Bridge.

          MICHAEL
     WHAT!

          BETTY
     How bizarre!

          CAROLYN
     Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote
     all this?

          LAWYER
     Well, it was notarized, and witnessed
     by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can
     ask her.

          MICHAEL
     Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?

          CAROLYN
     I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama
     told me years ago she died.

          MICHAEL
     Well, I don't care if it's legal or
     not, we're not cremating her and
     throwing her all over some bridge
     where we can't even go visit her
     because she's going to be blown all
     over the place like an ashtray.

          BETTY
     Not to mention people driving over
     her and doggies doing their business --

          MICHAEL
          (interrupting)
     We're not doing it! I'm not even sure
     it's Christian.

          BETTY
     Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their
     mother was Italian.

          MICHAEL
     Doesn't matter. Move on.

The women dare not object. The lawyer raises his eyebrows
and continues:

          LAWYER
     Well, we'll come back to that. Shall
     we open the box?

                              JUMP CUT TO:

MOMENTS LATER

C.U. SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX

A key is inserted and the lid is opened. There are many
papers, deeds, et. Michael begins sorting through these.

Carolyn notices a manila envelope addressed to her mother,
postmarked 1965. She opens it up to find TWO LETTERS and A
PHOTOGRAPH -- FRANCESCA standing NEAR A COVERED BRIDGE, her
hair wind blown, her expression serene, beautiful and sad.
She wears a RED DRESS with buttons down the front.

          CAROLYN
     Michael, look -- I've never seen this
     picture of mama. Have you?

Betty and Michael look over her shoulder. He shakes "no."

          CAROLYN (cont'd)
     It was in this envelope from 1965.

          BETTY
     She's not wearing a bra.
          (takes bridge photo)
     This is Roseman Bridge in case
     anyone's interested.

Interested yes, but no one thinks anything of it. Michael
returns to the other papers. Betty takes the photograph for
further examination. Carolyn opens one of the letters and
begins to read.

The following dialogue is heard OS, as CAMERA ANGLES ON
CAROLYN reading one of the letters:

          BETTY (O.S.)
     It's a beautiful picture of her.

          MICHAEL (O.S.)
          (to lawyer)
     Why are there two deeds here?

          LAYER (O.S.)
     One of for the original parcel your
     father bought and this one is for the
     additional acres he purchased in '59.

          MICHAEL (O.S.)
     And this?

          LAWYER (O.S.)
     Those are bills of sale from the
     equipment your mother sold in ..
          (CONTINUES O.S.)

Throughout their conversation, we focus on Carolyn as she
reads and her expression sinks into one of shock and
confusion. She flips to the last page of the letter to read
who it is from. She can't believe her eyes.

          BETTY (O.S.)
     What's that?

Carolyn jumps a little, so engrossed in her discovery. She
lies.

          CAROLYN
     Oh, just a old letter from a friend.

          BETTY
          (laughs)
     No treasure maps, huh?

          CAROLYN
          (laughs nervously)
     No.

Betty starts inspecting knit knacks around the house she
might be able to take. Carolyn looks to Michael.

          CAROLYN (cont'd)
     Michael.

          MICHAEL
          (reading documents)
     Yeah.

          CAROLYN
     Michael.

          MICHAEL
          (irritated)
     What?!

          CAROLYN
     Come here a minute.

Michael crosses impatiently to Carolyn. Carolyn looks around
to the others, then guides him OS into the kitchen for
privacy. He protests.

          MICHAEL
     What? Where are we going?

They exit. Alone with the impatient lawyer, Betty examines a
vase as she pumps him for info.

          BETTY
     Did she say anything in there about
     me? Leaving me anything in particular?

          LAWYER
     No.

Betty prattles on as she examines each item, much to the
lawyer's dismay, hiding her resentment and hurt.

          BETTY
     I didn't expect so. She never liked
     me. It's okay. I always knew. Thought
     we married too young. Nobody broke
     his arm -- that's what I said but you
     know mothers and their sons. Also,
     she never liked the fact of us moving
     to Florida although what's where the
     opportunities were. Couldn't deny
     that. Suppose we should have visited
     more but you know she hardly ever
     made an effort to come to Tampa. Not
     even to see her grandchildren. She
     was a cold woman. They say Italians
     are hot-blooded but not her. She was
     cool as ice.
          (picks up a
           candlestick)
     She leaves these to anyone?

Michael and Carolyn re-enter the living room. Michael's
expression now matches Carolyn in disbelief.

          BETTY (cont'd)
     What's going on?

          MICHAEL
     Um... we were just wondering how it
     might be better if me and Carolyn
     went over the stuff by ourselves. Not
     keep you two waiting around. I'll
     contact your office about the legal
     work.

Grateful, the lawyer packs up to leave.

          BETTY
     I don't mind waiting.

          MICHAEL
     Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to
     do. Lists of people we have to write
     to. Find mama's relatives addresses
     in Italy -- stuff like that.

          BETTY
     Well, I can help.

          MICHAEL
     I said NO!

That came out a bit aggressively. Betty is hurt.

          MICHAEL (cont'd)
     Why don't you go to your mothers. Or
     back to the hotel. Sit in some air
     conditioning. Take a bath.

          BETTY
          (near tears)
     I do not need instructions from you
     to bathe!
          (gets her bag)
     I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come
     all the way here and be shut out as
     usual! I came to be here for you! I
     didn't have to come!
          (genuinely hurt)
     Lord knows I was never much welcome
     in this house before. Apparently dead
     or alive, nothing's changed.

          CAROLYN
     Aw, Betty.

Carolyn feels badly for her. An impatient Michael refuses
sympathy. Embarrassed, Betty starts to exit then stops at
the mantle.

          BETTY
     Carolyn -- you want these
     candlesticks?

          CAROLYN
     No. You can have them.

Betty grabs them both and exits. Carolyn looks at him
disapprovingly. Michael takes the letter from her hand.

          MICHAEL
     Now what's this about?

                              CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Sitting at the kitchen table, Carolyn is in the middle of
reading the letter to Michael.

          CAROLYN
     "-- going over and over in my mind
     every detail, every moment of our
     time together and I ask myself, "What
     happened to me in Madison County?" I
     struggle to put it together in a way
     that allows me to continue knowing
     we're on separate roads. But then I
     look through the lens of my camera,
     and you're there. I start to write an
     article and I find myself writing it
     to you. It's clear to me now we have
     been moving towards each other,
     towards those four days, all our
     lives --

          MICHAEL
          (rises)
     Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to
     hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the
     damn thing! I don't want to hear it!
     Throw it away!

Carolyn continues reading silently. Michael's curiosity gets
the best of him:

          MICHAEL
     What's he saying now?

          CAROLYN
     Well, he just gets on about how if
     mama ever needed him, she could find
     him through the National Geographic
     magazine. He as a photographer. He
     promises not to write again. Then all
     it says is...
          (beat)
     I love you... Robert.

          MICHAEL
     Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.

          CAROLYN
     That would be some trick. He's
     already dead. That's what this other
     letter is.
          (takes letter and
           skims)
     From his attorney. He left most of
     his things to mama and requested...
          (she stops)

          MICHAEL
     What?

          CAROLYN
     That he be cremated and his ashes
     thrown on Roseman Bridge.

          MICHAEL
     DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have
     thought of that herself. It was some
     damn perverted... photographic mind
     influencing her! When did the bastard
     die?

          CAROLYN
     '82.

          MICHAEL
     Wait a minute! That was thirty years
     after daddy. Do you think...?

          CAROLYN
     I don't know. I'm completely in the
     dark here. That's what I get for
     moving away.

          MICHAEL
     This happened way before we both got
     married. I... I can't believe it.
          (then, innocently)
     You think she had sex with him?

Carolyn cannot believe he is this dense.

          CAROLYN
          (sarcastic)
     My Lord. It must feel real nice
     living inside your head with Peter
     Pan and the Easter Bunny.

          MICHAEL
     Don't talk to me like that. She was
     my mother for Christsakes. And now I
     find out she was... She was a --!

          CAROLYN
     Don't say that!

          MICHAEL
     Well, what am I supposed to think?

          CAROLYN
     I can't believe she never told me? We
     spoke at least once a week. How could
     she do that?

          MICHAEL
     How did she meet him? Did Dad know?
     Anything else in that envelope?

          CAROLYN
     No, I don't think so. I --

She dumps it over and a SMALL KEY FALLS OUT. Pause, as
Carolyn and Michael look to each other -- they grab the key
and run out of the kitchen, almost comically falling over
each other in their obsession to put this puzzle together.

A SERIES OF JUMP CUT --

From one lock to another as they try to find the keyhole that
fits the key -- they try closets, attic doors, jewelry boxes,
night tables, vanity drawers... Finally --

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

At the foot of their parents bed sits an WALNUT HOPE CHEST,
covered with a tapestry. Michael and Carolyn look to each
other first, before one removes the tapestry and the other
tries the key. It fits. They open the chest to find:

Camera equipment, a chain with a medallion that reads
"FRANCESCA," three leather bound notebooks -- and a sealed
envelope with "Carolyn or Michael" written on it.

          CAROLYN/MICHAEL
     You read it!

Carolyn relents. She takes out the lefter and reads:

          CAROLYN
     "January, 1987. Dear Carolyn. I hope
     you're reading this with Michael. I'm
     sure he wouldn't be able to read it
     by himself and he'll need some help
     understanding all this, especially
     the parts about me having sex..."

Insulted, Michael pulls the lefter out of her hand and
defiantly attempts to read it aloud himself to disprove his
mother's claim. But after looking at a few lines, he
surrenders and hands the lefter back to his sister.

          CAROLYN (cont'd)
     "First, and most of all, I love you
     both very much and although I feel
     fine, I thought it was time to put my
     affairs, excuse that word, in order."

          MICHAEL
     I can't believe she's making jokes.

          CAROLYN
     Sshhh. "After going through the
     safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll
     find you're way to this letter. It's
     hard to write this to my own
     children. I could let this die with
     the rest of me, I suppose.
          (cont'd)
     But as one gets older, one fears
     subside. What becomes more and more
     important is to be known -- known for
     all that you were during this brief
     stay. Row said it seems to me to leave
     this earth without hose you love the
     most ever really knowing who you
     were. It's easy for a mother to love
     her children no matter what -- it's
     something that just happens. I don't
     know if it's as simple for children.
     You're all so busy being angry at us
     for raising you wrong. But I thought
     it was important to give you that
     chance. To give you the opportunity
     to love me for all that I was..."

Carolyn and Michael look to each other like two school
children about to take a difficult exam. They continue.

          CAROLYN (cont'd)
     "His name was Robert Kincaid. He was
     a photographer and he was here in
     1965 shooting an article for National
     Geographic on the covered bridges of
     Madison County. Remember when we got
     that issue and looked at those
     bridges we'd seen for years but never
     noticed? How we felt like
     celebrities? Remember when we started
     getting the subscription?

They don't remember.

          CAROLYN (cont'd)
     I don't want you to be angry with
     him. I hope after you know the whole
     story, you might even think well of
     him. Even grateful.

          MICHAEL
     Grateful!?

          CAROLYN
          (reads)
     "... It's all there in the three
     notebooks. Read them in order.
     If you don't want to, I suppose
     that's okay too. But in that case I
     want you to know something -- I never
     stopped loving your father. He was a
     very good man. It's just that my love
     for Robert was different. He brought
     out something in me no one had ever
     brought out before, or since. He made
     me feel like a woman in a way few
     women, maybe more, ever experience..."

          MICHAEL
     That's it!

Grabbing the letter, he starts putting everything back in the
trunk.

          CAROLYN
     What are you doing?

          MICHAEL
     This is crazy. She waits till she's
     dead to tell us all this. Well, I got
     news for you. She was my mother.
     That's enough for me. I don't have to
     know who she was.

          CAROLYN
     Well, I'd like to read them.

          MICHAEL
     No. We're going to lock this up and --

          CAROLYN
     STOP IT!
          (Michael freezes)
     I want to read them! If you don't
     want to, then just leave. But don't
     you push me around like I'm some mule
     you paid for -- I already GOT A
     HUSBAND!

Michael is stymied.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Carolyn opens the first notebook which is dated AUGUST 1965.
Michael sits beside her with a cup of coffee.

          CAROLYN
          (reads)
     "I suppose his coming into my life
     was, in many ways, prepared for
     weeks, maybe even months before.
     There was a restlessness I feeling.
     Out of the blue and for no apparent
     reason. There's nothing more
     frightening to a woman whose been
     settled down for almost twenty years
     than to suddenly feel unsettled. I
     don't know when it started ... I do
     remember one night in particular, a
     little over a week before Robert
     arrived..."

CAROLYN'S VOICE BECOMES FRANCESCA'S VOICE AS WE:

                              DISSOLVE TO:

1965

INT. JOHNSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Richard is fast asleep while Francesca sits up in bed reading.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     "It was late at night after a long
     day. Your father was tired -- fighting
     all afternoon with that new
     equipment Robert Harrison convinced
     him to buy. But I wasn't tired.
     Lately, I could hardly sleep more
     than two hours a night. I was reading
     some John O'Hara novel, skimming the
     words, turning the pages without
     absorbing what I was reading. My mind
     was far away. And no matter how I
     tried, I couldn't call it back."

Francesca closes the book and turns off the light. She
nestles into the bed and tries to sleep. After a beat, she
opens her eyes and turns on the light. As she gets out of bed
she awakens Richard.

          RICHARD
     What time is it?

          FRANCESCA
     Later. Go back to sleep.

          RICHARD
     Where you going?

          FRANCESCA
     I'm not tired. I thought I might
     finish Carolyn's skirt.

          RICHARD
     Now?!
          (checks clock)
     It's after eleven.

          FRANCESCA
     I can't sleep.

          RICHARD
     Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.

          FRANCESCA
     I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not
     tired, now go back to sleep before
     you're up for the whole night too!

Francesca exits. Richard nestles under the covers, mumbling:

          RICHARD
     If you're not sick, how can it be
     contagious?

INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Francesca sits at her sewing machine, working on Carolyn's
skirt. When the thread runs out, she checks her sewing box
for another spool of that color. Not finding it, she raises
and walks to an opened closet. She pulls on a light cord and
checks her supplies.

There are shelves of boxes, crates, old clothes and shoes all
crammed together. She pulls out one shoe box and an entire
stack of items tumble off the shelf onto her head.

          FRANCESCA
     Damn it! Shit!

She looks at the mess and decides it's time to re-organize.

LATER:

The clock reads 2:30 AM. The closet has been emptied.
Francesca rummages through box after box.

Two huge piles have been created -- one for items to be thrown
away, another for items to be kept. Francesca is wiping the
bare shelves down with a rag and some cleanser. Looking up to
the bottom of the next shelf, she notices A SHOULDER STRAP
hanging, wedged between the wall and the shelf. Pulling over
a stool, she steps up to be eye level with the shelf.

It is an OLD HANDBAG -- of a style not seen since the forties
when she was a young girl. She pulls it down to examine. It
is very dusty and worn, but the snaps still work. She places
it against her side to see if it would still be fashionable.
She opens it and finds an old lipstick -- reading the bottom
where the name of the shade is located.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     Ha, they don't even made this color
     anymore.

She exits the closet and moves to an old mirror, trying the
lipstick on. As she decides whether or not she likes it, a
thought occurs to her... she remembers something.

She crosses back to the handbag and feels the inside for a
compartment hidden by a flap of material and a snap. She
unsnaps it and an old BACK & WHITE PHOTO slips out. She
looks at its image -- two young people against an Italian
background. Francesca is twenty years younger with her arms
around a handsome, black-haired charmer named --

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     "Niccolo. I couldn't remember the
     last time I had seen that face. And
     then the memories wouldn't stop.
     Like an avalanche..."

                              CUT TO:

FLASHBACK -

EXT. NAPLES COUNTRYSIDE, 20 YEARS EARLIER - DAY

A hot, breezy summer day. A young vibrant Francesca is
storming through an open field, angry, while Niccolo calls
after her in pursuit.

The following scene is played in Italian with subtitles.

          NICCOLO
     Francesca! Francesca! Where the hell
     are you going?

          FRANCESCA
     Leave me alone!

          NICCOLO
     You play these games and I'm supposed
     to follow -- run after you like a
     schoolboy. Well, I'm not! I'm fed up!

Niccolo stops. Several yards ahead of him, Francesca stops
and turns. Suddenly, she storms back towards him until they
are face to face.

          FRANCESCA
     So that's it! You just give up!

          NICCOLO
     What "give up"? You agreed with them!
     Mommy and Daddy said stay away from
     me and you said all right. What am I
     supposed to do?

          FRANCESCA
     Fight for me!

Niccolo grabs her violently.

          NICCOLO
     ENOUGH! You don't know what you want!
     Stop looking for me to tell you! STOP
     IT!

Francesca knows he's right. He releases her.

          NICCOLO (cont'd)
     We can go back now and end it or we
     can go back and you tell them off.
     This is your choice! Not mine. But I
     won't do this anymore. This is for
     children!

Frustrated and sad, Francesca sits upon the ground. Niccolo
knows she cannot face her parents yet he looks sympathetic.

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAWN 1965

Francesca sits on the back porch in her bathrobe, looking out
over the pasture as if she were watching the previous scene
happen right before her eyes.

In the pasture stands NICCOLO as he was twenty years ago.
Memories have overlapped. A field in Naples is now a pasture
in Iowa and Niccolo is as real to her as the grass. He is
staring at her seated on the porch of her Iowa home, a woman
twenty yards older than when he knew her. He smiles.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     "I had forgotten this. I had somehow
     remembered it being more his fault,
     his decision. Then I remembered we
     made love in that field before we
     left for home. And I remembered it
     was my idea. I remembered tearing
     his shirt and biting his body, hoping
     he would kidnap me. I had forgotten
     that too. And I wondered, as I sat
     there... how many other things I'd
     forgotten."

          RICHARD (O.S.)
     Frannie.

Startled, Francesca turns as if she were caught in the act.
Richard is fully dressed, prepared to start the day.
Francesca turns back to the pasture -- Niccolo is gone.

                              CUT TO:

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - EVENING

It is a week later. Francesca is making dinner. A COUNTRY
STATION is tuned in on the radio.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     "The following week was the Illinos
     State Fair. The two of you were going
     with dad to exhibit Carolyn's prize
     steer. It was the Sunday night you
     left. I know it sounds awful but I
     couldn't wait for you all to leave.
     You were going to be gone until
     Friday. Four days...
          (beat)
     Just four days..."

Francesca's expression looks as if she needs a break from her
family for more like four years.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     Michael! Carolyn! Richard! Dinner!

She sets down a bowl of potatoes, a plate of sausages, coffee
and corn as one by one her family enters and sits down.

Michael enters through a screen door from the back, letting
the DOOR SLAM SHUT.

          FRANCESCA
     Michael, what did I tell you about
     that door?

Richard enters after Michael, letting the door SLAM THE same
way. Francesca is about to say something, but gives up.

Everyone begins eating -- in complete silence.

When Michel can't open the ketchup bottle, Francesca grabs
it, palms the top skillfully and twists it off. She hands it
back to Michael who makes no comment.

When Richard scans the table for something that obviously
isn't there, Francesca is up out of her seat before he can
ask, at the fridge, grabbing the sour cream, closing the
fridge and back at the table with incredible swiftness.

When Michel moves his big arm to reach for the salt, he
knows over his cup and saucer, which Francesca catches with
both hands before they hit the floor. Her reflexes are like
a trained athlete.

Finally, Francesca is able to sit and sip her coffee. She
watches her teenage daughter fill her plate with a blank
expression that lets nothing slip through -- no indication of
all the tempests of emotions that go through a teenage girl.

          FRANCESCA
     You excited about going, Carolyn?

Without looking up, Carolyn fakes a smile. Looking at her,
Francesca remembers Carolyn as a three-year-old girl:

FLASHBACK.

In the same kitchen, THREE-YEAR-OLD CAROLYN runs around her
mother's feet completely naked, squealing with delight as
Francesca flicks her water from the tap.

FLASHBACK ENDS.

Francesca watches as Carolyn eats in silence, distant, locked
in her own secret teenage thoughts and dreams.

Francesca then looks to her son, shoveling food into his
mouth at an alarming rate. She attempts a conversation.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     How was your date last night?

          MICHAEL
          (w/o looking at her)
     Okay.

          FRANCESCA
     What's her name?

          MICHAEL
     Betty.

          FRANCESCA
     What's she like?

          MICHAEL
     Okay.

Silence. Frustrated, Francesca has a fantasy -

FANTASY:

Francesca picks up a blunt butter knife, rises out of her seat,
grabs her son and shoves the knife at his throat:

          FRANCESCA
     Do you like her?

Michael finally reacts with more than one word -- frightened
for his life.

          MICHAEL
     Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.

          FRANCESCA
     Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!

          MICHAEL
     Well, she's... she's real pretty and
     ... and she's got a cute shape...
     she's a good sport, ya know, for
     laughs and
          (desperate)
     ... she loves fried chicken wings and
     beer.

          FRANCESCA
     Isn't that nice? You should bring her
     home to meet us!

FANTASY ENDS.

Francesca looks at Michael in disgust.

          RICHARD
     We better get moving.
          (to Francesca)
     You sure you don't want to come?

Francesca looks at Richard with complete conviction.

          FRANCESCA
     I'm positive.

          RICHARD
     I'm going to miss you.

          FRANCESCA
     It's only four days.

He gives her a sweet peck on the lips. Francesca smiles,
anxious for them all to leave.

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Alone, dressed in her bathrobe, Francesca checks the front
door. She crosses to the living. Noticing two throw pillows
on the floor, she arranged them neatly on the couch. She sits
herself in an easy chair then flicks on a reading lamp and
opens her book. After five seconds, she closes the book. She
crosses to the TV and turns it on, then turns it off before
the picture tuned in.

She turns and leans on the TV, flicking the ON/OFF switch on
and off as her mind wanders. She gets an idea. She crosses to
the hi-fi and looks through several albums she got from her
Columbia Record Club. But nothing inspires her and she
quickly loses the desire for music. She's antsy. She has this
time alone and she doesn't know how to spend it.

She walks through the dining room, passing a china closet
filled with fancy dishes and glasses. She stops. Shoved in
the corner behind is an old, un-opened bottle of BRANDY. She
removes up, setting atop the dining table to open it.

But when she catches a reflection of herself in the window
opposite her, she stops. She sees a lonely, frustrated woman
in a tattered bathrobe anxious to open a bottle of liquor.
Deflated, she returns the brandy to the cupboard and exits.

EXT. BACK PORCH - NIGHT

Francesca sits on the porch with a book in her lap, gazing
out over the pasture. It's a hot night. She opens the top of
her rope a bit. Feeling the air against her skin, she decides
to open it a bit more. She gets an idea.

Standing, she looks to see if anyone is around -- though
rationally she knows there isn't a soul for miles. She turns
off the porch light. With a brave and daring impulse, she
sheds her bathrobe and stand naked under the night sky. The
air feels good against her body. She opens her arms up
against the night sky and moon like an Indian priestess.

Suddenly, she starts hitting her body as mosquitoes begin
attacking her bare torso. Thwarted, she quickly covers
herself with a robe and runs into the house.

                              CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Francesca trudges into the kitchen. As if on automatic, she
takes the coffee pot and fills it with water. She gets the
coffee and begins spooning it out. She stops. She gets the
idea of taking herself out for breakfast and dumps the coffee
pot out.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. MAIN STREET; WINTERSET - MORNING

A one street town. On either side are rows of storefronts, an
old coffee shop/diner, a bank, a medical center, a newspaper
building, a courthouse and a movie theater showing CAT BALLOU.
The steeple of the local church is the highest structure,
towering over the town from the end of Main Street.

INT. COFFEE SHOP/DINER - MORNING

Dressed in jeans and a light summer blouse, Francesca sits
alone -- treating herself to breakfast and the paper. Some of
the gossip news includes rumors of Frank Sinatra, 49,
marrying Mia Farrow, 19: Cary Grant 61, marrying DYAN CANNON,
27. Francesca shakes her head in disbelief at such news.

She tries to continue reading, but is distracted by the loud
conversation in the booth beside her:

TWO MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN and ONE MIDDLE-AGED HUSBAND sit after
breakfast discussing the local gossip.

          ELEANOR
     Oh, this heat! Times like this I wish
     we took that offer from your brother
     and moved on up to Michigan.

          HENRY
     They got heat in Michigan.

          ELEANOR
     Not this kind of heat.

          HENRY
     Heat is heat.

          ELEANOR
     Heat is not heat! There's different
     kinds! And this heat is much hotter
     than what they got in Michigan. You
     go and call your brother and see if
     he don't say the same thing.

          HENRY
     I'll get right on it.

Mrs. Delaney, an attractive well-off woman in her forties,
enters the shop and heads for the counter.

          GLADYS
          (whispers)
     Mrs. Delaney.
          (Eleanor looks)
     Did you hear the latest?

          ELEANOR
     No, what?

          GRADYS
     Apparently, she caught them.
          (Eleanor gasps)
     Ran right into them in Des Moines in
     the middle of her shopping.

          ELEANOR
     Oh, what a horror. Poor woman. That
     Redfield girl's got no business
     showing her face in daylight.

          GRADYS
     I don't know how that tramp stands
     living here. No one can bear even
     speaking to her. She has no friends.

          HENRY
     Well, nobody put a gun to his head.

          ELEANOR
     Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in
     control of these situations. Men
     don't know which end is up till a
     woman points.

Mrs. Delaney acts as if nothing is wrong. Yet, she knows
everyone knows and everyone knows she knows they know, yet no
one says a word. She sits at the counter.

          MRS. DELANEY
     Just coffee, please.

Francesca hears the gossip continue in hushed tones:

          GLADYS
     See. Money don't buy happiness. I
     must say, she's taking it well.

          ELEANOR
     I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield
     woman. Together. First one then the
     other. And then I'd laugh.

          GLADYS
     I'd laugh first then I'd kill them.
     Make sure they heard me laughing.

Eleanor nods. Not being able to stand it, Francesca rises.
She must pass them on the way to the counter, in order to
pay. Eleanor immediately stops her.

          ELEANOR
     Francesca! So, everybody got off okay
     last night?

          FRANCESCA
     Yes, thanks.

          GLADYS
     What you going to do all alone for
     four days -- a woman of leisure?

          FRANCESCA
     Oh, you know there's always something
     to be done. Have a good day. Henry.

Henry nods back. As she exits, they whisper.

          ELEANOR
     She's changed.

          GLADYS
     Oh, yes.

          ELEANOR
     She used to be so friendly.

          HENRY
     Maybe she's going through "the
     changes."

Eleanor hits him in the chest.

          ELEANOR
     What do you know about "the changes"?

          HENRY
     Well, I didn't know they was a secret
     club.

          ELEANOR
     Don't talk about what you don't know.
     Besides, she's too young for "the
     changes."

          GLADYS
     My niece had "the changes" when she
     was thirty-one.

          ELEANOR
     No. What a tragedy. What happened?

          GLADYS
          (wisely)
     She changed.

At the counter, Francesca pays up. She looks to Mrs. Delaney
and tries to smile, but Mrs. Delaney works hard at not making
eye contact with anyone. Suddenly, she rises telling the
waitress:

          MRS. DELANEY
     Excuse me for a moment, I left
     something in the car.

She exits quickly. Francesca pays up as the waitress adds:

          WAITRESS
     Poor woman.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP/DINER - MORNING

Francesca exits and heads for her truck. As she crosses from
one corner to another, she notices down the side street --

Mrs. Delaney sitting alone in her own car, sobbing. Unable to
bear the humiliation, she stole herself away to cry.

Francesca wants to help but feels useless. She quickly heads
for her truck.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY

Francesca sits on the front porch with some iced tea, trying
to cool herself off. It is a scorcher. She is barefoot, her
blouse hanging out of her jeans, her hair fastened up by a
tortoise shell comb.

Camera begins a slow move into close-up, as she sips her tea
and lets her mind wander. WE INTERCUT HER FANTASIES WITH HER
ON THE PORCH:

FANTASY: Back in town, Francesca slides into Mrs. Delaney's
car. She embraces the woman who cries into her arms.

-- Francesca on the porch.

FANTASY: Mrs. Delaney's car is surrounded by townpeople
 staring into it. Francesca hugs Mrs. Delaney closer to her in
 defiance.

-- Francesca on the porch.

FANTASY: Mrs. Delaney's car drives up to a train station. She
and Francesca exit with suitcases. They are surrounded by
news reporters as they make their way to the train.

          REPORTER
     Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it
     true Cary Grant has proposed to you?

          FRANCESCA
     Yes. And I've accepted.

          REPORTER
     What about his engagement to Dyan
     Cannon?

          FRANCESCA
     I said to him Cary you're being
     ridiculous. You're more than half her
     age. He said no one had ever been
     that honest with him and he falls in
     love with me.

          REPORTER
     What about your husband?

          FRANCESCA
     I'm very sad but Richard said that
     since it's Cary Grant, he completely
     understands. I'm also taking Mrs.
     Delaney away from this town. She'll
     be living with Cary and I in Beverly
     Hills.

She boards the train with Mrs. Delaney.

END OF FANTASIES.

Tired of her fantasies, Francesca looks up to the sun to
clear her mind. It is blinding. When she looks back out onto
the road, her vision is momentarily blurred. Until, slowly,
out of the blue, she sees:

A TRUCK driving toward her house, kicking up dust, like some
phantom appearing through the etheric plane. Francesca isn't
even sure it's real. She sips cool drink & blinks to
regain her vision. The truck slows down and turns into her
driveway. Francesca watches with suspicious curiosity as:

The truck stops and ROBERT KINCAID steps out. Flashing his
blue eyes in her direction, he smiles and says:

          ROBERT
     Sorry to bother you, but I've got a
     feeling I'm lost.

Francesca remains guarded.

          FRANCESCA
     Are you supposed to be in Iowa?

          ROBERT
          (laughs)
     Yeah.

          FRANCESCA:
     Well, you're not that lost.

He laughs. She puts down her tea and crosses to him.

          ROBERT
     I'm looking for a covered bridge out
     this way... uh... wait a minute --

He looks through a small notepad for the name. Francesca
finds herself scanning his body.

          FRANCESCA
     Roseman Bridge?

          ROBERT
     That's it.

          FRANCESCA
     Well, you're pretty close. It's only
     about two miles from here.

          ROBERT
     Oh, terrific. Which way?

Pause as Robert awaits directions and Francesca scans a sudden
impulse.

          FRANCESCA
     Well, I can take you if you want.

Robert is pleased, but a bit surprised as is Francesca who
anxiously recants:

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     Or I can tell you. I can take you or
     tell you. It's up to you. I don't
     care. Either way.

Robert smiles finding her sudden nervousness charming.

          ROBERT
     Well --

Suddenly, from the opposite direction of the road, A CHEVY
barrels by. The driver, FLOYD, toots his horn.

          FLOYD
     Howdy, Francesca.

          FRANCESCA
     Hey, Floyd.

He drives off. Francesca knows they've been seen. Slightly
annoyed by Iowain neighborliness, she turns to Robert and
with some defiance says:

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     It'd be better if I show you, I think.

          ROBERT
     If I'm not taking you away from
     anything.

          FRANCESCA
     No. I was just going to have some
     iced tea then split the atom, but
     that can wait.
          (he smiles)
     I just have to get my shoes.

Robert watches her as she turns and heads back to the house.
He watches her lift her blouse and tuck it into her jeans,
revealing her shapely hips and buttocks. He turns back to the
truck and notices the mailbox -- MR & MRS. RICHARD JOHNSON. He
nods as if he knew all along and begins to make room on the
front seat for Francesca.

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE

Francesca is slipping on her boots when she suddenly stops.
"What am I doing?", she asks herself silently.

EXT. JOHNSON DRIVEWAY

Francesca approaches the truck. On the door, she reads:
KINCAID PHOTOGRAPHY, BELLINGHAM, WASHINGTON.

Robert is clearing away paper cups, banana peels, paper bags,
photography equipment. In the back, Francesca notices a
cooler and a guitar case.

          ROBERT
     I wasn't expect company. Let me
     get this out of the way.

He hauls a case of film from the front to the back. Francesca
notices his tanned, muscular arm move in one graceful sweep.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     Okay. All set.

Francesca smiles. They both get into the truck.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     Now, where are we going?

          FRANCESCA
     Out, then right.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. MADISON COUNTY ROAD - DAY

As the truck drives, we see no one else in sight.

INT. KINCAID'S TRUCK

They drive in silence. Francesca is enjoying the breeze against
her face.

          ROBERT
     Pretty country.

          FRANCESCA
     Hmm-mmm.

She looks out at the vast expanse. It depresses her.

          ROBERT
     There's a wonderful smell about
     Iowa -- very particular to this part
     of the country. Do you know what I
     mean?

          FRANCESCA
     No.

          ROBERT
     I can't describe it. I think it's
     from the loam in the soil. This very
     rich, earthy kind of... alive...
     No. No, that's not right. Can you
     smell it?

          FRANCESCA
          (shakes her head)
     Maybe it's because I live here.

          ROBERT
     That must be it. It's a great smell.

Francesca wants to know more about him.

          FRANCESCA
     Are you from Washington originally?

          ROBERT
     Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty
     or so and then moved to Chicago when
     I got married.

          FRANCESCA
     Oh. When did you move back?

          ROBERT
     After the divorce.

          FRANCESCA
     Oh.

          ROBERT
     How long you been married?

          FRANCESCA
     Uh... uh...
          (can't remember)
     Umm... long time.

          ROBERT
     You don't look like a native, if you
     don't mind my saying so.

          FRANCESCA
     No, I don't mind. I'm not from here.
     I was born in Italy.

          ROBERT
     Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a
     story!
          (Francesca smiles)
     Whereabouts in Italy?

          FRANCESCA
     Small town on the Eastern side no
     one's ever heard of called Bari.

          ROBERT
     Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.

          FRANCESCA
          (surprised)
     No, really?

          ROBERT
     Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an
     assignment in Greece and I had to go
     through Bari to get the boat at
     Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I
     got off and stayed for a few days.
     Breathtaking country.

Francesca is overcome by the idea of such freedom.

          FRANCESCA
     You just... got off the train because
     it looked pretty?

          ROBERT
     Yeah. Excuse me a sec.

He reaches over with one arm, brushing slightly against her
thigh. He opens the glove compartment and pulls out a pack of
Camels and a Zippo lighter.

          ROBERT
     Like one?

Francesca, who doesn't usually smoke, accepts.

          FRANCESCA
     Sure.

She takes a cigarette out of the pack. Robert drops the pack
and, with the same hand, flicks open the Zippo and ignites it.
Francesca leans over. The road is bumpy and a breeze blows
through both windows.

She cups her hands around his to shelter the flame. She feels
his skin for a brief moment.

She sits back and enjoys the ride and her cigarette as Robert
lights up. Silence. They drive.

          ROBERT
     So, how long you've been living here?

          FRANCESCA
     Long.
          (changes subject)
     You just got off the train and stayed
     without knowing anyone there?

          ROBERT
          (laughs)
     Yeah.

EXT. ROSEMAN BRIDGE - DAY

The truck stops. They exit. Robert takes out some equipment.

          ROBERT
     This won't take long. I'm shooting
     tomorrow morning. I just need to do
     some prep work.

          FRANCESCA
     I don't mind waiting.

He smiles and takes his equipment to the bridge. Francesca
slowly follows. She watches his body move. Catching herself,
she stops.

Robert sets up a tripod in the small ravine beneath the
bridge, pointing a view finder up as he plans his shots.
Francesca walks through the bridge, noticing lovers names
scrawled on the inside: CATHY & BUDDY 4 EVER... ROSIE AND
HANK TILL THE END OF TIME. Through a crack in one of the
wooden planks, Francesca watches like a voyeur as Robert
works. She sees him take out a handkerchief and wipe the sweat
off his neck, then inside his shirt and around his chest.
Without knowing where Francesca is, Robert speaks aloud:

          ROBERT
     Is it always this hot?

Francesca moves quickly away from the plank, like a Peeping
Tom who's been caught.

          FRANCESCA
     This time of year.

          ROBERT
     Would you do me a favor and go to the
     truck? Inside that leather bag with
     the pockets is a package of lens
     cleaners. Would you grab me one?

Francesca obliges, grateful for something to occupy her.

Inside the truck, she scans for the leather bag. She sees it
next to a duffel bag. The bag' zipper is opened. She
glimpses inside as Robert's personal things -- clothes, socks,
underwear, shaving kit. Life magazines from July and August,
one depicting the death of Aldai Stevenson; the other a cover
photo of the Watts riots. She grabs the leather bag and
opens it.

At the bridge, Francesca looks for Robert in the raving but
he is gone. She looks through the bridge to the other end
and sees only the tripod. No Robert. She walks through the
bridge and out the other end. She finds Robert bent over,
picking flowers.

          FRANCESCA
     Oh there you are.

          ROBERT
     Oh! You caught me.

He rises with a bouquet of wildflowers for her.

          ROBERT
     Thanks for your help.

Francesca smiles, not knowing how to take this.

          ROBERT
     Men sill give women flowers, don't
     they? I mean, as a sign of
     appreciation? I'm not that out of
     date, am I?

          FRANCESCA
     No, not at all --
          (suddenly)
     except those are poisonous.

          ROBERT
     WHAT!

He flings the flowers down. He wipes his hands furiously.

          FRANCESCA
     I'm sorry. I was kidding.

Robert looks at her with a shocked smirk, secretly liking her
strange behavior.

          FRANCESCA
     I'm sorry. I don't know what -- I'm
     sorry. Really. They're lovely.

She begins picking up the flowers.

          ROBERT
          (smiling)
     Are you by nature a sadistic person?

          FRANCESCA
     No, I'm not.
          (trying not to laugh)
     I don't know why I said that. I've
     been in a very... strange mood all
     day. I've never done anything like
     that before. It's... I'm just...
          (looking for excuse)
     Well, you know, the whole world is
     just going nuts.

Robert looks at her like she's nuts. Francesca tries to dig
herself out of her hole. Robert enjoys offering no help.

          FRANCESCA
     What with those riots in Los Angeles
     and people burning draft cards and
     ... Adlai Stevenson dying last month.

She rises with the flowers. Robert gives her a friendly pat
on the arm.

          ROBERT
     Shouldn't let things get to you so
     much.

He continues with his work. Francesca expresses relief and
embarrassment behind his back.

INT. TRUCK - LATER

Driving back, Francesca sits with her feet up on the
dashboard. Robert drives while he fiddles with the radio. All
he can find are country stations.

          FRANCESCA
     Looking for something in particular?
     There's not much of a selection.

          ROBERT
     I found this Chicago station before.
     Wait a minute...
          (he tunes it in)
     Here it is.

We hear a BLUES SINGER with a sax arrangement.

          FRANCESCA
     Oh, that's nice.

          ROBERT
     Want another cigarette?

          FRANCESCA
     Sure.

Francesca's having a great time.

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY

Robert's truck drives down the road and into the driveway.

          ROBERT
     Well, thank you for all your help,
     Mrs. Johnson.

          FRANCESCA
     Francesca.

          ROBERT
     Francesca. Robert.

Francesca nods, as if to say hello and goodbye in the same
moment. She gets out of the car, closes the door, then asks:

          FRANCESCA
     Would you like some iced tea?

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Robert fiddles with the kitchen radio, tuning in to the
Chicago station. Francesca is making iced tea. Robert sits
back down at the kitchen table.

          FRANCESCA
     Lemon?

          ROBERT
     Sure.

With her back to him, Robert never takes his eyes off her.
She turns and crosses to him, with the tea.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     Thanks.

Francesca smiles and sips her own. She watches him gulp down
the tea so fast, some of it dribbles down the side of his
face and neck. Francesca finds it sexy. He empties it.

          FRANCESCA
     Would you like another one?

Robert nods and he pulls out his cigarettes.

          ROBERT
     Mind if I smoke?

          FRANCESCA
          (at the sink)
     Not at all.

Robert lights up as he watches her fix another iced tea. He
watches her slip off one boot, then the other -- never missing
a beat of her preparation. He can't help eyeing her body.
When she returns, she also has the flowers he picked for her
arranged in a Casper the Friendly Ghost jelly glass. She
places them on the table and sits.

          ROBERT
     Sure you want to keep those in the
     house?

          FRANCESCA
     I'm so sorry about that. It was
     rude. I think I just got nervous
     for some reason.

          ROBERT
     I thought it was funny.

She likes that.

          FRANCESCA
     Where are you staying while you're
     here?

          ROBERT
     A little place with cabins. The
     something-Motor Inn. I haven't
     checked in yet.

          FRANCESCA
     And how long are you here for?

          ROBERT
     As long as it takes, I might stay a
     week. No more I don't think. Where's
     your family?

          FRANCESCA
     My husband took the kids to the
     Illinos State Fair. My daughter's
     entering a prize steer.

          ROBERT
     Oh. How old?

          FRANCESCA
     About a year and a half.

          ROBERT
     No, your kids.

          FRANCESCA
     Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.

          ROBERT
     Must be nice having kids.

Francesca looks at him and FANTASIZES SAYING:

FANTASY:

          FRANCESCA
     Not any more. It's awful. They're
     awful. I can't stand them.

END OF FANTASY:

But in reality, Francesca chooses instead to say:

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     They're not kids anymore. Things
     change.

          ROBERT
     Everything does. One of the laws of
     nature. People are always so afraid
     of change. But if you look at it like
     it's something you can count on
     happening, it's actually a comfort.
     Not many things you can count on for
     sure.

          FRANCESCA
     I guess. Except I'm one of the people
     it frightens.

          ROBERT
     I doubt that.

          FRANCESCA
     Why?

          ROBERT
     Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.

          FRANCESCA
          (explaining)
     Richard was in the army. I met him
     while I was living in Naples. I
     didn't know where Iowa was. I only
     cared that it was America. And of
     course, being with Richard.

          ROBERT
     What's he like?

As Francesca thinks of an answer, she looks over to the
entranceway between the kitchen and the front hall and sees:

FANTASY:

Richard standing there in his underwear, reaching over his shoulder.

          RICHARD
     Franny, could you clean out my boil
     again?

END OF FANTASY:

Francesca answers Robert, half of her still in fantasy --

          FRANCESCA
     He's very... clean.

          ROBERT
     Clean?

          FRANCESCA
          (catching herself)
     No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's
     also other things. He's a very hard
     worker. Very honest. Very caring.
     Gentle. Good father.

          ROBERT
     And clean.

          FRANCESCA
     Yes. Very clean.

They drink. Francesca thinks she sounds like an idiot.

          ROBERT
     So you must like Oiwa, I guess.

Francesca looks at him. She wants to tell the truth, but
holds back.

          FRANCESCA
     It's... uh... uh...

She stops. Robert smiles.

          ROBERT
     Go ahead. I won't tell anyone.

Surprised, Francesca looks at him oddly -- as if he already
knows and is giving her permission.

          FRANCESCA
     It's...
          (tries again)
     I...
          (finally)
     I hate it!

She covers her mouth, like a reflex -- worried someone heard.
Robert just smiles and nods.

Francesca is so taken by his understanding and acceptance,
she lets the flood gates open, speaking faster than her mind
can keep up --

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
          (without a pause)
     I hate it! I hate it! I HATE IT! I
     hate the corn and the dust and the
     town and the cows and that SMELL that
     you love! I hate the people.
     Everybody knows everybody's business,
     I mean it's nice now and then,
     they're always there to help out, but
     that's just it, it's like they're
     waiting for something awful to happen
     to help out and when nothing awful is
     happening, then they just sit around
     and talk about what is happening
     which is none of their business. I
     want to kill them sometimes for how
     cruel they can be --

Camera begins slowly moving out to a wider angle...

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     -- everybody's talking about poor Mrs.
     Delaney whose husband is having an
     affair with that Redfield woman and
     "isn't it a shame," and "isn't it
     awful," and the truth is THEY'RE
     LOVING IT! Poor woman can't even be
     cheated on without the grocery man
     knowing about it -- no one respects
     anyone's privacy. You're not even
     safe in your own home! They think
     they can just walk right into your
     house because they BAKED you
     something. It's like they have a
     secret password and YOU CAN'T KEEP
     THEM OUT! I live in fear of that door
     opening and having a peach cobbler
     shoved at me...
          (CONTINUES MOS IF
           NEEDED)

Throughout this rapid fire monologue, camera has moved to a
wide angle as Robert just sits and listens, letting her get
it all off her chest. She continues as we:

                              DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM

Francesca is lying on the couch as Robert places a cold cloth
on her head. Her "confession" took a lot out offer.

          ROBERT
     Feeling better?

          FRANCESCA
     Much.

          ROBERT
     Is the dizziness gone?

          FRANCESCA
     I think so.

She sits up. She feels exposed. But also, relieved.

          ROBERT
     I better go. You sure you're all
     right?
          (she nods)
     It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.

          FRANCESCA
     I feel so embarrassed.

          ROBERT
     Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what
     I can tell, I got here just in time.
     Any later and you'd have made the
     front page, running down Main Street
     naked, smoking Camels out of your
     butt.

          FRANCESCA
          (laughs)
     But I... We don't even know each
     other.

          ROBERT
          (sincerely)
     You have no reason to feel ashamed.
     You haven't said anything you don't
     have a right to. And if anybody tells
     you different -- you just send them to
     me.

She smiles. He turns to exit.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     Better get my stuff.

Francesca surprises herself. She doesn't want him to go.

          FRANCESCA
     Would you like to stay for dinner?
          (he turns)
     There aren't many choices in town and
     ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone.
     So would I.

          ROBERT
     That's very nice of you. I don't get
     many dinner invitations on the job.
     It would be a welcome change. Thanks.

                              CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - LATER

Francesca rushes in and starts to disrobe, getting ready to
shower and change for dinner. She glances out the window and
sees:

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE

Robert is at the water pump. His shirt is off and he is
washing himself. (WE INTERCUT THE TWO.)

Francesca finds herself staring, a bit open mouthed. He has
a muscular, firm body. She watches how the water cascades
over his body. How he seems so unashamed, so "in his skin,"
moving with such strength and grace.

Robert pauses and looks out over the open pasture. The cold
water feels good. Since the pump is the back of the house,
hidden from the road, no one can see him. He decides to take
off his pants and cool himself further.

Francesca begins watching this in shock until she has to
literally pull herself away from the window with such a force
that she rams herself into a chest of drawers, knocking over
an array of perfume bottles and a mirror. She deftly catches
a falling bottle and freezes. Taking a breath, she pulls
herself together.

          FRANCESCA
     This is ridiculous. Stupid!

She replaces the bottle and heads for the bathroom quite
composed, then, without warning, makes an immediate 180
degree turn and heads back to the window to sneak a peek.

Seeing him, she gasps.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     Oh my God.

Watching him, she is possessed by some very frightening
feelings and runs from the window, into the bathroom, closing
the door behind her.

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

Francesca is gathering some vegetables for dinner, from her
garden. Robert is at his truck, in his pants, changing into
a fresh shirt.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Francesca is cutting up vegetables. Robert enters with some
of his gear.

          ROBERT
     I'm just going to put some of this
     film in your fridge. Heat isn't too
     forgiving out there.

He does. On the radio, TONY BENNETT sings "WRAP YOUR TROUBLES
IN DREAMS." Robert approaches Francesca.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     Can I help?

          FRANCESCA
          (surprised)
     Help cook?

          ROBERT
     Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat
     bananas with our feet, ya know.

          FRANCESCA
          (laughs)
     Okay.

They stand side by side. Francesca hands him a stack of
carrots and a knife.

MONTAGE:

Tony Bennett's up-tempo tone plays over a series of images of
Francesca and Robert talk and prepare dinner.

-- Four hands side by side, cutting and chopping.
Occasionally, a hand brushes against another as it reaches
for something.

-- Robert's hand gently touching Francesca's waist as he
reaches around her for an onion.

-- Robert lighting Francesca a cigarette.

-- Robert brings in his cooker through the screen door. HE
MAKES SURE IT DOESN'T SLAM. FRANCESCA MAKES A NOTE OF THIS.

-- Robert opens the cooler and removes two cold beers, tossing
one to Francesca.

-- Francesca opening a new tablecloth and spreading it out on
the table.

-- Francesca handing Robert plates from the shelf, their
fingers only barely touching.

END OF MONTAGE

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

Robert and Francesca are in the middle of dinner. But instead
of the usual silence that surrounds Johnson family eating,
Francesca is mesmerized by Robert as he manages to eat and
tell a story. The scene begins with a LAUGH FROM FRANCESCA.

          ROBERT
          (laughs)
     ... No, wait, it gets better.

He stands up and acts it out for her.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     You have to get the full picture
     here. I have three cameras around my
     neck, a tripod in one hand and my
     pants down around my ankles. I
     thought this was a private bush. I
     look up and this gorilla, this female
     gorilla, is staring at me with what
     can best be described as the most
     lascivious expression I've ever seen
     on a female with so much body hair.
          (Francesca laughs)
     I freeze. 'Cause that's what they tell
     you to do. In this position. She comes
     towards me and... and she...
          (he stops awkwardly)

          FRANCESCA
     What?

          ROBERT
     She starts sniffing me.

          FRANCESCA
     Oh my God...
          (laughs)
     You're blushing.

          ROBERT
     It's still a very sensitive memory
     for me.

          FRANCESCA
     Then what happened?

          ROBERT
     We got engaged.

          FRANCESCA
     Oh you!

She throws a napkin at him.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     None of this is true!

          ROBERT
     No, it is. Except for the engagement
     part. She wouldn't have me, although
     I still get a Valentine every year.

Francesca is laughing so hard she can't breath. Robert loves
making her laugh.

          FRANCESCA
     You ought to write these stories
     down.

          ROBERT
     Nah. I've tried. My writing's too
     technical, I think. Problem of being
     a journalist too long is you stop
     giving yourself permission to invent.
     I better just stick to making pictures.

          FRANCESCA
     "Making pictures." I like that. You
     really love what you do, don't you?

          ROBERT
          (nods, smiles shyly)
     I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.

          FRANCESCA
     Why, do you think?

          ROBERT
     I don't know if obsessions have
     reasons. I think that's why they're
     obsessions.

          FRANCESCA
     You sound like an artist.

          ROBERT
     No. I wouldn't say that. National
     Geographic isn't exactly the hub of
     artistic inspiration. They like their
     wild life in focus and without any
     personal comment. I don't mind
     really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that
     a long time ago. It's the course of
     being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.

          FRANCESCA
          (supportively)
     I don't think you're normal.

He looks at her in surprise. She catches herself again.

          FRANCESCA
     I didn't mean that the way it sounded.

          ROBERT
     Well, let's just call it a compliment
     and move on.
          (changes subject)
     Did you love teaching?

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     Sometimes. When there was a particular
     student who made a difference. I know
     they're all supposed to, but it's not
     true. You tend to single out one or
     two you think you can contribute
     something to.

          ROBERT
     And did you?

          FRANCESCA
     I'd like to think so. I know one of
     them went on to Medical school.

          ROBERT
     Why did you stop?

          FRANCESCA
     My children. And Richard didn't like
     my working.

          ROBERT
     Do you miss it?

          FRANCESCA
     I don't know. I've never thought
     about it... what was the most
     exciting place you've ever been to?
     Unless you're tired of talking about
     it.

          ROBERT
     You're asking a man if he's too tired
     to talk about himself? You don't get
     out much, do you?

Francesca smiles, a little embarrassed.

          ROBERT
     I'm sorry. That was...

          FRANCESCA
          (overlapping)
     No. It's all right. I just meant, it
     might be a little dull for you,
     telling all this to some housewife
     in the middle of nowhere.

          ROBERT
     This is your home. It's not nowhere.
     And it's not dull.

Francesca smiles again, this time relieved.

          ROBERT
     Let's see -- my favorite place...

Francesca settles in to listen, never taking her eyes off of him.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     Well, it's the obvious choice, but I
     think I'd have to say Africa. It's
     another world. Not just the people
     and the cultures but the land, the
     colors you see at dawns and dusks --
     and the life there. It charges every
     molecule of air.

Francesca is fascinated, being drawn into his imagery.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     It's tangible -- the moment to moment
     of life and death, the co-habitation
     of man and beast, of beast and beast,
     who'll survive, who won't -- and
     there's no judgement about it. No
     right or wrong or imposed morality.
     It's just life. It's a voyeurs
     paradise really because those animals
     don't want anybody in their business.
     You can watch but at a distance.
          (excited)
     I remember one time I was on a truck
     headed for the Niger.

Lights begin to dim as Francesca is so taken in by his story,
she begins to actually see what he is describing.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     We were driving north. The truck was
     old so I guess the sound of the motor
     muffled this kind of rumbling in the
     distance -- until finally, it was upon
     us like, like a hundred thunder claps
     all at once...

CU on FRANCESCA as WE BLEND THE SOUNDS OF AFRICA and --

                              CUT TO:

EXT. AFRICA - DAY

Robert and a driver are in a truck driving north. Robert
turns to look out the window and sees:

A HERD OF GIRAFFES AND GAZELLES AND WATERBUCKS AND ZEBRA are
running in the grasslands to the right of the truck. Robert
excitedly instructs the driver:

          ROBERT
     Get us closer!!

The driver veers off towards the stampede as Robert opens his
door and makes his way to the flatbed part of the truck with
his camera. The truck takes its position within this
breathtaking force of wildlife, as giraffes, zebras and
gazelles surround it -- all going in the same direction.

Robert stands in the truck, shooting as fast as he can. The
truck races to keep up with the animals. Robert is so pumped
he can hardly catch his breath. Suddenly, the force and
beauty of these creatures causes him to lower his camera. He
is unable to film it because it overwhelms him. He just
stands there in awe and lets out a primal scream. The animals
gradually veer off to where the truck can no longer follow.
Robert watches them disappear into the distance.

                              CUT BACK TO:

INT. JOHNSON KITCHEN - NIGHT

Francesca has seen all of this in her mind. Robert smiles at
her, sensing how in tune with the story she was.

          FRANCESCA
     My God. How I'd love to see that.

          ROBERT
     They have safaris for tourists now.
     Maybe you can convince your husband.

Francesca smiles. There is an awkward pause between them.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     It's a beautiful night. Would you
     like to go for a walk?

          FRANCESCA
     Well, it's kind of buggy out there.

          ROBERT
          (rises)
     Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine
     Woman taught me how to make bug
     repellent tea out of tree root.

          FRANCESCA
     You drink bug repellent?

          ROBERT
     No, you rub it on you. I have some in
     the truck. Don't go away.

She shakes her head. He runs out the screen door, not letting
it slam. Francesca looks like a teenager with first date
excitement.

EXT. PASTURE - NIGHT

Francesca and Robert walk through the pasture. She sniffs her
arm.

          FRANCESCA
     Smells like dirt.

          ROBERT
     You get used to it.

          FRANCESCA
     When?

          ROBERT
          (laughs)
     You want to go back in?

          FRANCESCA
     No. I'm all right. It's working.

Silence. They walk. It is a beautiful night.

          ROBERT
     You've got it all right here, you
     know. It's just as beautiful as any
     other place I've seen. God, it
     knocks me out.

          FRANCESCA
     What?

          ROBERT
          (indicating the night)
     This "... Of what I call God and
     fools can Nature." Who wrote that?

          FRANCESCA
     Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.

          ROBERT
     I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who
     I'm stealing from. If you can't
     create art I think the least you can
     do is recognize it around you, don't
     you think? There is...
          (genuinely affected)
     ... so much beauty.

She watches him with great appreciation. He smiles at her.
Instead of looking away, their eyes remained locked for a
moment. There is clearly an attraction. They simultaneously
look away and continue walking.

Francesca's heart is beating a mile a minute yet she can't
deny she is enjoying herself. Walking side by side in
silence, Francesca turns back occasionally to look at her
house as they get further away from it. Suddenly, the more
distant the house becomes, the more frightened she starts to
feel. Something inside her knows she's going too far with
this man -- too far from home. Although a part of her wants
it, she is surprised to find a larger part of her finds
too unknown. She stops.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     What's wrong?

Francesca looks confused for a moment, not knowing what she
wants. She can't move. She searches for a way out.

          FRANCESCA
     Would you like some coffee? Or maybe,
     some brandy?

Somehow Robert can sense her uneasiness. He obliges.

          ROBERT
     How about both?

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Francesca moves about the kitchen preparing coffee -- dropping
the coffee pot basket, spilling the grounds. She acts tense.
Robert sits at the table opening the brandy bottle Francesca
almost opened the night before, aware of her mood.

Francesca gets the coffee going then sets the table with cups
and saucers.

          ROBERT
     You sure you won't let me help you
     with those dishes?

          FRANCESCA
          (coldly)
     No. I'll do them later.

          ROBERT
     Francesca?

          FRANCESCA
     What?

          ROBERT
     Are you all right?

          FRANCESCA
     Yes.

          ROBERT
     Francesca?

          FRANCESCA
     What?

          ROBERT
     We're not doing anything wrong, do
     you.

Francesca freezes. He has read her mind again.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
          (smiles)
     Nothing you can't tell your children
     about.

Once again, he relieves her of fear and anxiety. He hands her
a glass of brandy...

                              CUT TO:

1995

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Carolyn and Michael have come to the end of a notebook.

          MICHAEL
     He's getting her drunk. That's what
     happened. Jesus, maybe he forced
     himself. That's why she couldn't tell
     us.

          CAROLYN
     Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.

          MICHAEL
     Nice? He's trying to sleep with
     somebody's wife.

          CAROLYN
     I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And
     besides, something like that doesn't
     make you a bad person. He reminds me
     of Steve in a way. Steve's weak,
     immoral and a liar but he's still a
     real nice guy. He just shouldn't be
     married.
          (laughs)
     At least not to me. You getting
     hungry? I'm hungry.

Michael nods, then speaks with sincere compassion.

          MICHAEL
     I had no idea it's gotten that bad,
     sis.

          CAROLYN
     Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please.
     No one's forcing me to stay.

          MICHAEL
     Then why do you?

          CAROLYN
     And do what? Live alone? Go back to
     school? Find someone else? Start a
     magazine for confused woman? ... What
     if I can't do any of those things?

Michael can't answer her. Carolyn looks through the cabinets.

          CAROLYN (cont'd)
     There's not much here to make.

          MICHAEL
     Let's go into town and get a bite.
     We'll take the books with us.

Carolyn nods. Michael looks for the next notebook, checking
the dates.

INT. CAR - EARLY EVENING

Michael drives as Carolyn opens the next notebook and reads:

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     "We sat sipping brandy. I thought if
     anybody walked through the door now
     there'd be no explaining it. But I
     didn't care. And I loved that I
     didn't care. I almost wanted it to
     happen. Then there'd be no turning
     back. I wanted to be like him. I
     lived this life of his. We talked
     about his wife and I was jealous --
     not of her -- but of his leaving. His
     fearlessness. He knew what he wanted.
     How did he do that.

                              CUT BACK TO:

1965

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Francesca sips her brandy. Robert sits in the easy chair.

          FRANCESCA
     Do you mind if I... ask you why you
     got divorced?

          ROBERT
     Not at all. I wasn't around much...
     So why did I get married? Well, I
     thought it was a good idea at the
     time. Have a home base. Roots. You
     can get lost moving around so much.

          FRANCESCA
     So what happened?

          ROBERT
     I never got lost. For some reason,
     I'm more at home everywhere than at
     one place. So I decided I'll think of
     myself as some kind of world citizen.
     I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm
     kin to everyone, and no one in
     particular. See, once you get into
     the habit of not needing anyone, it's
     kind of hard to break.

          FRANCESCA
     You must get lonely at times.

          ROBERT
     Never touch the stuff. I've got
     friends all over the world. Good
     friends I can see when I want, if I
     want.

          FRANCESCA
     Woman friends, too?

          ROBERT
     I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.

Francesca averts her eyes, before continuing her investigation.

          FRANCESCA
     You really don't need anyone?

          ROBERT
     No, I think I need everyone! I love
     people. I want to meet them all!
     I just think there are too many out
     there saying "This is mine." or
     "She's mine." Too many lines have
     been drawn. World's breaking apart
     because of man's weakness for some
     testosterone conquests over territory
     and power and people. He wants
     control over what deep down he knows
     he has no control over whatsoever and
     it scares him silly.

          FRANCESCA
     Why doesn't it scare you?

          ROBERT
     I embrace Mystery. I don't know
     what's coming. And I don't mind.

          FRANCESCA
     Do you ever regret it? The divorce,
     I mean.

          ROBERT
     No.

          FRANCESCA
     Do you ever regret not having a
     family?

          ROBERT
     Not everybody's supposed to have a
     family.

          FRANCESCA
     But -- how can you just live for what
     you want? What about other people?

          ROBERT
     I told you, I love other people.

          FRANCESCA
     But no one in particular.

          ROBERT
     No. But I love them just the same.

          FRANCESCA
     But it's not the same.

          ROBERT
     That's not what you're saying. I know
     it's not the same. What you're saying
     is, it's not as good. Or it's not as
     normal or proper.

          FRANCESCA
     No, I'm just saying --

          ROBERT
          (interrupting)
     I'm a little sick of this American
     Family Ethic everyone seems to be
     hypnotized by in this country. I
     guess you think I'm just some poor
     displaced soul doomed to roam the
     earth without a self-cleaning oven
     and home movie.

          FRANCESCA
          (irritated)
     Just because someone chooses to
     settle down and have a family doesn't
     necessarily mean they're hypnotized.
     Just because I've never seen a
     gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm
     asleep in the world.

          ROBERT
     Do you want to leave your husband?

Francesca is completely stunned and thrown off guard.

          FRANCESCA
     No. Of course not.
          (rising, upset)

Beat. Awkward silence. Suddenly there is tension between them.

          ROBERT
     My mistake. I apologize.

          FRANCESCA
     What made you ask such a question?

          ROBERT
     I thought that's what we were
     doing -- asking questions.

          FRANCESCA
          (defensive)
     I thought we were just having a
     conversation. You seem to be reading
     all this meaning into it. Meanings I
     must be too simple to, uh...
     interpret or something.

          ROBERT
     I already apologized.

Silence. Robert remains seated. Francesca remains at the sink.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     It's getting late.
          (rises)
     Thank you for dinner.

Pause. Francesca feels badly.

          FRANCESCA
     Listen, I'm sorry I --

          ROBERT
     No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake.
     It was an inappropriate thing to ask.

          FRANCESCA
          (shrugs it off, then:)
     ... I feel like something's been
     spoiled now.

Robert smiles and crosses to her. He takes her hand into both
his hands.

          ROBERT
     It's been a perfect evening. Just the
     way it is. Thank you.

Francesca smiles. The possibility of a kiss hangs in the air
between them until Robert turns to get his film out of the
fridge. As he exits through the screen door, he stops.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     One thing though -- don't kid yourself,
     Francesca. You're anything but a
     simple woman.

He smiles and exits, catching the screen door before it
slams.

Francesca doesn't move for a moment, then crosses to the door
as if to run after him when she is stopped by the PHONE
RINGING. She picks up.

          FRANCESCA
     Hello?

          RICHARD (on phone)
     Franny?

          FRANCESCA
     Richard, hi.

          RICHARD (on phone)
     How are you?

          FRANCESCA
     Fine. Everyone settled in okay?

          RICHARD (on phone)
     Just fine. We're all in one room.
     Michael's on the couch and
     Carolyn's...
          (continues...)

She hears Robert's truck door open and close. She hears the
motor being turned on. She half-listens to Richard.

          FRANCESCA
     Uh-uh... good... Hmmm...

She hears the truck driving away as Richard continues:

          RICHARD (on phone)
     We got our position in the Fair. Not
     bad although I would have liked to be
     third which is not too early and not
     too late. But I told Carolyn not to
     worry...
          (continues, if needed)

                              CUT TO:

INT. FRANCESCA BEDROOM - NIGHT

Francesca exits her bathroom, in her bathrobe, shutting the
light. She is brushing her hair and thinking of Robert. She
sits on the edge of the bed. She sees her reflection in a
mirror on the closet door.

She stands and takes her robe off. She steps forward to look
at her body -- running her hands gently around her curves, her
neck, down the side of her thighs, her face, her breasts.

She shuts off the lights and gets into bed under the covers.
She closes her eyes and tentatively begins to explore her
body. It is awkward for her but we can see her trying to let
herself go. Until she opens her eyes in frustration. It's no
good. She can't do it. She feels ashamed. The shame turns
into anger.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Francesca sits at a writing table with two large books opened
before her containing literary quotations. She searches for
the line Robert mentioned in the pasture.

A note sits before her as well. On it reads: "Robert. Again,
I'm sorry for last night. Would you like supper again tonight
after you're finished. I'd like it very much if I were one of
those good friends you have in the world. Anytime is fine --
Francesca... P.S. By the way, "Of what I call God and Fools
call Nature" was..." She writes the name BROWNING.

EXT. ROSEMAN BRIDGE - NIGHT

Francesca is tacking a note for Robert to the bridge. She
considers taking it down a moment later, but decides not to.
She gets back into her truck and drives away.

WIDE ANGLE OF BRIDGES - DAWN

                              DISSOLVE TO:

The view of the bridge goes in and out of focus until we
realize we are seeing it through Robert's camera lens.

Once the focus it sets, Robert notices something is tacked
onto the bridge. He crosses to it hurriedly -- time for the
perfect shot is running out -- pulls it down, thumbtack and
all, and shoves it into his pocket, unread. He returns to
his camera to take his shots.

                              CUT TO:

INT. JOHNSON BEDROOM - MORNING

Francesca is making her bed when she hears a truck driving
down the road. She looks out the window to see:

Robert's truck. However, it passes right by her house.

Francesca's spirit sinks. She feels silly, ashamed and
rejected. She sits on the bed.

FANTASY:

Inside the truck, Robert drives by the house and chuckles to
himself at the foolishness of some boring, frustrated
housewife. Francesca's note has been crumbled and stuffed
into a dirty ashtray.

END OF FANTASY:

Francesca enters her bathroom, slamming the door behind her.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER THAT MORNING

Francesca sits at the kitchen table in her bathrobe with a
cup of coffee -- a comic portrait of shame and self-pity. Her
hair is a mess, she hasn't showered or dressed and she stares
into space while listening to the bluesy Chicago radio
station.

The sink is full of dirty dishes she refuses to clean. Beside
it is an ashtray of butts from the night before. She carries
it over to the table and begins fingering for a butt to
smoke in desperation. She lights up and stares into space.

FANTASY:

Robert is in Africa talking to TWO ZULU TRIBE MEMBERS. THE
DIALOGUE IS SUBTITLED IN SWAHILI:

          ROBERT
          (laughs)
     ... and then she tacks this note on
     the bridge asking me to have dinner
     with her again!

One Zulu turns to the tower and remarks.

          ZULU
     How pathetic.

END OF FANTASY:

Francesca put out her cigarette and suddenly gets an idea.
She goes to the phone, reads a number off of a slip of paper
and dials.

          FRANCESCA (on phone)
     Hello? Is Richard Johnson staying
     there?... No, I don't want to leave
     a message. Maybe you can help me --
     I'm his wife and I live in Winterset
     Iowa -- I wanted to surprise them by
     driving up tonight. What would be the
     fastest route, the Interstate?... Huh-
     huh... Hold it, let me get a pen.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. PAY PHONE, GAS STATION - LATE MORNING

Francesca's note is opened in Robert's hand. Her phone number
is written after the "P.S." He stands in the pay phone
getting a busy signal from Francesca's line. He hangs up.

                              CUT TO:

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY

Francesca, dressed and packed, prepares to leave. She checks
her purse to make sure she's got everything. She grabs her
bag and exits.

A few beats later, the phone rings. But she doesn't return.
It rings again. We hear Francesca's truck door open and
close. It rings again. We think Francesca is on her way,
until:

We suddenly hear her burst into the house and see her leap
for the phone.

          FRANCESCA
          Hello?

INTERCUT --

INT. SLOW BEND SALOON/RESTAURANT - DAY

Robert is at another pay phone.

          ROBERT
          Francesca?

          FRANCESCA
          (out of breath)
     Yes! Hi.

          ROBERT
     Am I interrupting anything?

          FRANCESCA
     No. I was just... No.

          ROBERT
     I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I
     just read your note. I stuffed it
     into my pocket. The light was fading
     and I had to get my shot.

          FRANCESCA
          (relieved)
     The light was fading. Huh-huh.

          ROBERT
     I would love to come for dinner.

          FRANCESCA
          (smiles)
     Wonderful. Uh...

          ROBERT
     Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge
     until a little after sunset. I want
     a few night shots. Would you like to
     come with me? If you're interested...

          FRANCESCA
     Oh, sure. Great.

          ROBERT
     I'll pick you up.

          FRANCESCA
     No. I'll drive myself. I have a few
     errands. I'll meet you there.

          ROBERT
     Okay. See you later.

          FRANCESCA
     Yeah. See you later.

Francesca is thrilled. Her mind races with a list of things
she must do before tonight. She opens a cabinet, removes a
coffee can and empties it of her house money. She quickly
counts it, then shoves it into her purse.

EXT. ON THE ROAD - DAY

Francesca drives past a sign marking Des Moines as the next
town.

INT. SLOW BEND SALOON/ RESTAURANT - DAY

The second of two eating establishments in Winterset. A
lunch time crowd fills the place. Robert is seated at the
counter. He can sense their eyes on him, wondering who this
stranger is and what's he doing here. He knows the whispered
conversation is about him.

A MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE talk at table.

          WIFE
     Thelma told me he checked into the
     Motor Inn and the bill goes to
     National Geographic Magazine.

          HUSBAND
     National Geographic? What the hell's
     he doing here? We ain't got no naked
     pygmies to take pictures of.

          WIFE
     He's taking pictures of the bridges.

          HUSBAND
     Ain't no pygmies there either.

Robert wants to finish his lunch as quickly as possible. At
that moment, someone enters the restaurant and all the
conversation stops. He overhears one waitress turn to the
other and whisper --

          WAITRESS
     God. It's Lucy Redfield.

Both the Waitress and Robert (though more subtly) turn to see:

THE REDFIELD WOMAN. But instead of being the harlot we might
think, she's actually a rather plain, demure looking woman --
not nearly as fancy or pretty as Mrs. Delaney herself.

As she crosses the counter, Robert immediately picks up on
the vibes in the room. He notices all the patrons stare then
turns away to whisper. The waitress behind the counter ignores
her. A customer eating at the counter places a bag on an
empty stool beside her, so the Redfield woman can't sit down
near her.

Robert and the Redfield woman's eyes meet. She is clearly
uncomfortable. She turns, about to leave, when Robert clears
his cameras off of a stool next to him and offers:

          ROBERT
     Got room right here if you like.

She is surprised at his courtesy. Others are astounded. Some
disgusted. She accepts his offer and sits beside him.

          REDFIELD WOMAN
     Thank you.

          ROBERT
     Hot out there today.

She nods and smiles. The waitress tosses a menu at her and
slams down a glass of water, then moves on down the counter.
The Redfield woman tries to act casual, glancing through the
menu. Robert subtly scans the room as all eyes are on them,
then turn away.

Robert returns his glace back to the Redfield woman who is
now only pretending to read the menu. She is so embarrassed.
She wants to leave but can't move.

          WAITRESS
     Well, are you ordering anything!?

Her harsh tone startles the Redfield woman as well as Robert.
Gathering her dignity, she responds.

          REDFIELD WOMAN
     No. Thank you. I've changed my mind.

She politely nods to Robert, gathers her things and exits.
Robert looks to the waitress, as a SECOND WAITRESS enters.

          SECOND WAITRESS
     I'd've thrown that water right in her
     face.

          WAITRESS
     Poor Mrs. Delaney.

The waitress walks O.S. leaving the second waitress facing
Robert, who looks at her curiously. The second waitress looks
back as if to say, "What business is it of yours?" and exits.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. DES MOINES - DAY

A metropolis compared to Winterset.

Francesca exits a liquor store with a bottle of wine in a
paper bag. She also carries a bag of groceries as she heads
down the street to her parked truck. She passes a DRESS SHOP
and stops.

                              CUT BACK TO:

EXT. WINTERSET - DAY

Robert enters a general store. He buys a six pack of beer
for his cooler and approaches the counter for the Cashier.

          CASHIER
     That all?

Robert nods. He decides to have some fun and test the waters a
little bit.

          ROBERT
     Isn't it awful about poor Mrs.
     Delaney?

With this, the damn bursts -

          CASHIER
     Tragic is more like it. The pain that
     woman has been subjected to by that
     no-good husband. I never liked him.
     Known him for years. People say he's
     quiet. Well, it's the quiet ones that
     can sneak up behind you and stab you
     in the back. I heard yesterday, that
     she confronted him. Gave him the
     ultimatum and you know what he did?--
          (CONTINUES AS NEEDED)

Robert stands astounded, listening to this diatribe of gossip.

                              CUT BACK TO:

INT. DES MOINES DRESS SHOP - DAY

Francesca sits in her slip, alone in a dressing room, with
several dresses strewn about. The panic of indecision has set
in. She looks at herself in the mirror and begins to doubt
that seeing Robert is a good idea. Or perhaps she's imagining
something that isn't there. And what about Richard?

MEMORY:

A few years back. Francesca is dressed up for some formal
affairs. She heads down the stairs. Richard is waiting in the
hall, in a suit and tie. He looks at her admiringly.

          FRANCESCA
     Ready. You have the keys?

But Richard doesn't answer. He's just staring at her.
Francesca stops. Richard looks at her like a little boy.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     What's the matter?

Richard is obviously impressed by how she looks, but he can't
say anything. He just smiles shyly and shakes his head to say
nothing is wrong and opens the door for her.

END OF MEMORY:

Francesca feels guilty when a SALESWOMAN enters with a pretty
summer dress.

          SALESWOMAN
     How about this one?

Francesca examines it. She likes it. But the guilt...

          FRANCESCA
     I don't know. I haven't bought a
     dress for myself in so long.
          (saleswoman nods)
     I mean, I'm just buying a dress. It's
     not a special occasion or anything.
     I'm just shopping. Just shopping for
     a new dress, that's all.

          SALESWOMAN
          (completely
           understands)
     That might work. And if he's still
     mad, just tell him you could have
     done better but you married him out
     of pity. That's always works for me.

                              CUT TO:

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Francesca enters with her new dress, groceries and wine as
the PHONE RINGS. She puts everything down to answer.

          FRANCESCA
     Hello?

Intercut ROBERT at a pay phone.

          ROBERT
     It's Robert.

          FRANCESCA
     Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little
     late, but I'll still...

          ROBERT
          (w/difficulty)
     Listen, don't take this the wrong way
     but, I'm wondering if this is such a
     good idea.

Francesca's heart sinks.

          FRANCESCA
     Oh.

          ROBERT
     I uh... I had lunch in town today.
     Happened to cross paths with "that
     Redfield woman." I apologize. I
     thought you were half-joking about
     that.

          FRANCESCA
     Oh. I guess you got the whole story.

          ROBERT
     The cashier at the general store was
     very dangerous.

          FRANCESCA
     I think he's running for town crier
     next year.

          ROBERT
     I now know more about their affair
     than I remember about my marriage.
          (seriously)
     Francesca, the last thing I want to
     do is put you in any kind of
     situation that would... even though
     we know it's just -- I mean, it's
     nothing like that, but if anybody saw
     us or...
          (can't finish)

          FRANCESCA
          (disappointed)
     I understand.
          (touched)
     That's very kind of you.

Silence. Both want to meet. Both experience the idea of not
seeing each other even again in this brief moment. Someone
has to say something to save it -- but who will it be?

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     Robert?

          ROBERT
     Yeah?

          FRANCESCA
     I want you to come.

Robert is relieved.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     I'll meet you at the bridge just like
     we planned all right. Don't worry about
     the rest of it... I'm not.

          ROBERT
     All right. See you there.

Francesca smiles and hangs up. In that moment, Francesca
realizes consciously what she is doing and what she wants.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. CEDAR BRIDGE - DUSK

Robert is already there, working. He checks his watch,
anxious for Francesca to arrive, when he hears a truck
driving up. He looks to see Francesca stop and get out. By
their expressions we can tell how glad they are to see each
other.

          FRANCESCA
     Sorry I'm late. Richard called.

          ROBERT
     Oh, how is he?

          FRANCESCA
     Fine. They're all having a good time.
     How many more shots do you have?

          ROBERT
     Couple. Want to help?

She nods. He extends his hand. She pauses, then takes it. He
leads her to the bridge. Walking away from camera, they say:

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     I should stop off at the motel to
     clean up before dinner.

          FRANCESCA
     Well, I have plumbing at my house.

                              CUT TO:

INT. JOHNSON BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Francesca enters. Robert is in the bathroom, in the shower,
with the bathroom door slightly ajar. His clothes are laid on
the bed with his bag beside them. A fresh shirt is folded.
Francesca takes his dirty shirt and decides to clean it. As
she exits, her eye can't help roaming toward the bathroom
door. For a moment, she pauses to listen to the sound of the
water as it hits his body.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Francesca is busy preparing dinner. Robert enters, cleaned
and dressed.

          ROBERT
     Can I help?

          FRANCESCA
     Actually, no. I've got everything
     under control. I'd like to clean up
     myself a bit. I'm going to take a
     bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a
     half hour.

          ROBERT
     How about if I set the table?

          FRANCESCA
     Sure.

          ROBERT
     Would you like a beer for your bath?

          FRANCESCA
          (surprised)
     Yes, that'd be nice.

Robert gets her one.

INT. BATHROOM - LATER

Francesca lounges in a tub with a beer poured into a wine
glass. She finds it very elegant. She takes a deep breath,
thinking "What's going to happen tonight?"

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Robert is at the radio when Francesca enters in her new
dress. She looks beautiful. And it's all over Robert's face.

          FRANCESCA
     What's wrong?

Unlike her husband, Robert has an answer.

          ROBERT
     Absolutely nothing. You're just sort
     of a knockout in that dress.

She smiles and crosses to the stove.

          FRANCESCA
     Table looks beautiful.

He can't take his eyes off of her. On the radio we hear DIHAH
WASHINGTON begin to sing "IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO" -- a
beautiful, blusey lovesong. Francesca pulls out a pan of hot
rolls as THE PHONE RINGS. Francesca moves toward it with a
roll, which she tosses to Robert. He burns his fingers and he
smiles at her joke. The song plays throughout.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     Hello? Hi, Madge?

Francesca and Robert do not take their eyes off of each other
throughout the call. Robert takes a bit of the roll.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     Huh-huh. Nothing, just making
     myself some dinner... No what?...
     Oh... I heard about him. Yeah, I hear
     he's some kind of photographer.
          (Robert smiles)
     No, I didn't... Huh-huh... Hippie?
     I don't know, is that what hippies
     look like?...

Robert steps closer to her, purposely reaching across her
body for a napkin.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     Oh he is, huh? Well, don't tell Floyd,
     he'll be out with a shotgun...

She notices a crumb on Robert's mouth and wipes it off.
Robert takes her hand and holds it, lowering it to his side.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     Well, listen, I have a pot boiling.
     I've got to go... No, they don't get
     home until Friday morning... Well,
     maybe I'll give you a call. Okay. Bye.

She hangs up. The two are now almost face to face. Robert
raises her hand up and slips his free one around her waist.
They begin to dance to the song. The kitchen lights have not
been turned on since the sun went down. The sky, a dark
orange and magenta, illuminates the room through the window.
They never take their eyes off of each other. Suddenly,
Robert stops.

          ROBERT
     You're shaking. Are you cold?

Francesca shakes her head. They dance a bit more, but
Francesca is shaking which makes it difficult. They both
stop. Robert places his huge hands on either side of her
face, gently stroking her hair away from her cheek. He
whispers.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     If you want me to stop, tell me how.

He brushes his cheek and face softly against hers. Francesca
rubs hers against him. She can barely breathe.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     Francesca, I won't be sorry. I won't
     apologize for this.

          FRANCESCA
     Nobody's asking you to.

They kiss. Hands gently explore. Their bodies touch. Their
lips never spend more than seconds away from each other.
Robert gently slide his hands down her breasts and torso,
exploring every inch of her. Francesca grips his massive
back, sliding up to his neck and hair. Robert lifts her leg
and presses it against his hip, kissing her neck and
shoulders. Francesca starts to lose herself, clutching his
head at her breast then pulling him up to her mouth once
again.

INT. SLOW BEND CAFE - PRESENT DAY - EVENING

The same saloon/restaurant of twenty-five years ago has been
turned into a modern cafe yet the original charm is still
there.

Carolyn and Michael sit in a booth, with half-eaten dinners
before them. Carolyn has been reading the book to Michael
when she looks across from her to find -- Michael looking like
a little boy who is fighting not to cry.

          CAROLYN
     What's the matter?

Michael shakes his head. He can't or won't explain. He's too
upset. His eyes tear up. Carolyn feels badly for him.

          MICHAEL
     I'm going to get some air.

He exits. Carolyn smiles sympathetically. Somehow this last
passage of their mothers doesn't affect her in the same way.
She returns to the book but first asks a passing waitress,
with great urgency.

          CAROLYN
     Can I smoke here?

The waitress nods. Carolyn needs a cigarette for the rest of
this. She opens her bag to get her pack. Inside her bag she
notices a BUSINESS CARD. She picks it up to read IRA NEWMAN,
attorney. Divorce. Pre-Nuptials. Marital Litigation. She
pauses for a moment. Then, tossing the card back inside, she
lights her cigarette and takes a drag. We follow the curls of
smoke up as we:

INT. JOHNSON LIVING ROOM

Camera moves down curls of smoke, to reveal:

Robert and Francesca in each others arms, under a blanket on
the living room floor on a bed of couch pillows, smoking a
cigarette after lovemaking. Francesca seems miles away --
feelings of regret and guilt creeping in.

          ROBERT
     Are you comfortable?
          (she nods)
     Do you... want to move to the
     bedroom?

          FRANCESCA
     No. I can't. Not yet.

She can't bring herself to go into her husband bed.

          ROBERT
     You want to eat something?

          FRANCESCA
     Are you hungry?

          ROBERT
     No.

Silence. Robert shifts his body to face her.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     Honey. Are you all right?

She looks at him and starts to cry, shaking her head. The room
is filled with memories of her family. She nestles in his arms.
He folds her. She closes her eyes.

          FRANCESCA
     Take me somewhere.

          ROBERT
     What?

          FRANCESCA
     Right now. Tell me someplace you've
     been -- someplace on the other side
     of the world. Anywhere but here.

          ROBERT
          (thinks, then:)
     How about Italy?

          FRANCESCA
     Yes.

          ROBERT
     How about Bari?

          FRANCESCA
     Yes. Tell me about the day you got
     off the train.

          ROBERT
     Have you ever been to that station?

          FRANCESCA
     Yes.

          ROBERT
     You know that little place nearby
     with the striped awning that sells
     sandwiches and little pizzas...

The two transport themselves together to another place, where
there is no familiar memories surrounding them to interfere.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. JOHNSON PORCH - NIGHT

The two sit in bathrobes on the porch looking out over the
pasture. They have plates of dinner on their laps. They eat
voraciously.

          ROBERT
     Do you have anymore of the stew?

Chewing, Francesca nods and leans over, picks a pot off the
porch and ladles some more onto his plate. Too much falls out
and it spills onto the robe.

          FRANCESCA
     Oh, I'm sorry.

          ROBERT
     It's okay. It's not that hot anymore.
     Thanks God.

Francesca hands him a dish rag. Robert wipes off the food
revealing his bare leg. She reaches over and touches it. He
looks at her and smiles. She leans over and kisses him
passionately until, suddenly, she pulls away. She looks
upset. She rises and moves away to look out to the pasture.
Robert can sense what is wrong.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     You think too much, you know that?

          FRANCESCA
     I just feel like I'm getting a little
     ... out of control that's all. It's
     kind of frightening.

          ROBERT
     Why?

          FRANCESCA
     Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I
     hardly know what to do with. I...
     can't seem to... stop them.

          ROBERT
     Nobody's asking you to.

          FRANCESCA
          (excited)
     And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I
     know it!

          ROBERT
     I sat outside and had coffee.

          FRANCESCA
     Where? Near the doorway or the near the
     front of the church?

          ROBERT
     Near the church.

          FRANCESCA
          (closes her eyes)
     I sat there once. It was hot. Like
     today. I'd been shopping. I had all
     these bags around my feet I kept
     having to move every time the waiter
     came by...

                              DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SANDWICH CAFE - BARI - DAY

Francesca sits at the outdoor cafe in Bari with shopping bags
around her feet. She re-arranges them as the waiter passes
by, mumbling something vulgar under his breath. When she
looks up -- Robert is standing there. She smiles. He offers
her hand. She takes it and rises. They leave the cafe.

MONTAGE:

Francesca and Robert together against the breathtaking
backdrop of the Italian countryside.

EXT. BARI COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

On a lakefront, Robert and Francesca make love.

WE INTERCUT WITH:

INT. JOHNSON LIVING ROOM - EVENING

FRANCESCA AND ROBERT MAKING LOVE ONCE AGAIN.

Francesca looks at him and understands he is giving her full
permission to explore whatever she wants. Hesitantly, she
crosses to him and takes his plate away. She stands before
him, leaning him back into his chair. She slowly,
tentatively, opens her robe. She strokes his hair, then
caresses his head and gently guides it between her legs.

1994

INT. SLOW BEND RESTAURANT - NIGHT

C.U. on an ashtray filled with cigarette butts as Carolyn
anxiously lights another. These last entries have over
stimulated her. She calls to the waitress abruptly.

          CAROLYN
     Can I get another cup of coffee,
     please?

When she looks up, she sees Michael has returned. He sits.

          CAROLYN (cont'd)
     Where did you go?

          MICHAEL
     Bar across the street.

          CAROLYN
     Have you called Betty?
          (she shakes his head)
     Maybe you should.

          MICHAEL
     I found out who Lucy Delaney is.
          (she looks interested)
     Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest
     Road?

          CAROLYN
     Yeah. But I thought she died.

          MICHAEL
     He remarried. Apparently they were
     having an affair for years.
     Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was
     a bit of a stiff.

          CAROLYN
     You mean -- she didn't like sex?

          MICHAEL
          (nods, then simply:)
     I bet mom could've helped her.

          CAROLYN
     Boy. All these years I've resented
     not living the wild life in some
     place like Paris and all the time I
     could've moved back to Iowa... Are
     you drunk?

          MICHAEL
     Not yet. You want to go?

          CAROLYN
     I think I better. Between the book
     and the coffee, I'm this close to
     raping the busboy.

EXT. IOWA LAKEFRONT - NIGHT

Michael and Carolyn have parked in a secluded area near a
lake. Some place where the moonlight and the scenery create
a beautiful backdrop. They sit on the ground, leaving the
headlights and the radio on. They are getting drunk sharing
a bottle of whiskey.

          MICHAEL
     I used to love this place. I used to
     take Kathy Reynolds down here.

          CAROLYN
     You never dated Kathy Reynolds!

          MICHAEL
     Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall
     were pinned at birth. But I was crazy
     about her. And for about three months,
     I managed to catch her during her
     "exploring" stage.

          CAROLYN
     I never knew that.

          MICHAEL
          (sadly)
     Nobody did.

          CAROLYN
     Was this during Betty?

          MICHAEL
     Everything was during Betty. God we
     were so young. Why did we think we
     had to do it all so fast? I've never
     cheated on Betty. Not once we were
     married, I mean.

          CAROLYN
     Did we want to?

          MICHAEL
     Only about a thousand times. What do
     I do now? "What's good enough for mom
     is good enough for me?"

          CAROLYN
          (pissed off)
     What gets me is I'm 46 years old.
     I've been in this crummy fucking
     marriage -

          MICHAEL
     Carolyn!

          CAROLYN
          (ignores him)
     -- for over twenty years because
     that's what I was taught -- you stick
     with it! Normal people don't get
     divorced. I can't remember the last
     time my husband made love to me so
     intensely that he transported me to
     Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite
     frankly, I don't think he ever did!
     And now I find out in between bake
     sales, my mother was Anais Nin!

          MICHAEL
     What about me! I feel really weird.
     Like she cheated on me, not dad.
     Isn't that sick? I don't mean I
     wanted to sleep with her or anything
     but -- ya know -- being the only son.
     You're sort of made to feel like
     you're the prince of the kingdom, ya
     know? And in the back of your mind,
     you kind of think your mother doesn't
     need sex anymore because she has you.

          CAROLYN
     You're right -- that is sick.

They drink.

          MICHAEL
     If she was so unhappy, why didn't she
     leave?

They look to each other without an answer. Then simultaneously
they reach for the notebooks.

          MICHAEL (cont'd)
     Can I read it now? I think I'm ready.

Carolyn offers him the book then lays back in a relaxed
position in order to listen. Michael flips to an ear marked
page.

          MICHAEL (cont'd)
     What paragraph were you up to?

          CAROLYN
          (casually)
     She just made him perform oral sex on
     the porch.

Michael freezes. He loses his nerve. Carolyn helps.

          CAROLYN (cont'd)
     Go ahead, Michael. You've got to do
     this. Just think, "Today I am a man."

Michael nods and takes another swig. He reads:

          MICHAEL
     "I'd never had a man make love to me
     that way before."
          (stops)
     Oh Jesus.
          (continues)
     "I couldn't believe the feelings
     bursting inside of me. As if I had
     opened some forbidden Pandora's box."

Camera begins to move to wide angle as Francesca takes over.

          FRANCESCA
     "It seems, thinking about it now,
     that in those few days I lived a
     completely different life as a
     completely different woman. What was
     recognizable as me before Robert was
     gone. We decided to spend Wednesday
     away from Winterset. Away from
     Madison County. Away from pastures
     and bridges and people too familiar
     and reminders too painful. We let the
     day take us where it wanted..."

1965

INT. DES MOINES MOVIE THEATER - DAY

VIVIEN LEIGH is walking down a ships stairs in the 1965 film
"SHIP OF FOOLS." She is alone on screen. She walks, slightly
intoxicated. Suddenly, Charleston music plays out of nowhere
and she begins to dance, by herself, without any self-
consciousness.

In the movie theatre, Robert sits with his arm around
Francesca like teenage lovers. Her head is nestled in his
chest as she eats from a bag of popcorn. Robert barely keeps
his eyes on the screen, staring at Francesca and stroking her
hair.

EXT. DOWNTOWN DES MOINES STREET - DAY

Francesca and Robert walk hand-in-hand, window shopping and
taking in the sights. For Francesca, it is as if she is
seeing everything for the first time.

INT. BOOK STORE - DAY

Robert introduces Francesca to the photography section,
showing her a book of one of his favorite photographers,
Walker Evans. Francesca admires one photograph in particular
-- a mother and child during the depression.

          FRANCESCA
     On that one is beautiful. Look at
     their expressions. As if the camera
     weren't on them at all. As if they
     had no strength left to hide what
     they were feeling.

          ROBERT
     He's a genius. They're not
     photographs -- they're stories, entire
     histories captured in moments.

          FRANCESCA
     I bet you could do a book.

          ROBERT
     No. I couldn't.

          FRANCESCA
     Why do you say that?

          ROBERT
     Because I already tried once.

Francesca is surprised. She senses his disappointment.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     It's no big deal. I know how to work
     a camera, how to make it "make
     pictures" -- but I don't know how to
     make it make art.
          (laughs)
     At least that's what six publishers
     said. To take what we see of this
     world and give it back with a bit of
     ourselves in it. It's a mystery to me.

          FRANCESCA
          (smiles, supportive)
     But you don't mind.

          ROBERT
          (smiles)
     No, I don't mind.

She brushes his hair away from his face affectionately. As he
looks at another book, she notices their reflection in a
mirror. She puts her arm through his. They look like a couple
to her -- two people who belong together.

INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - DAY

Francesca and Robert have an elegant lunch.

          FRANCESCA
     What were you like when you were
     younger?

          ROBERT
          (smiles)
     Trouble. Why?

          FRANCESCA
          (laughs)
     I just wondered. Why were you trouble?

          ROBERT
     I had a temper.

          FRANCESCA
     What were your parents like?

Pause. Robert doesn't reply. She looks at him curiously.

          ROBERT
     I can't do this, honey.

          FRANCESCA
     What?

          ROBERT
     Try and live a lifetime before
     Friday. Cram it all in.
          (shakes his head)

This is the first time either has mentioned their time clock.
Francesca nods, understandingly.

Across the room, Francesca notices A MOTHER having dessert
with her FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, a pretty little girl in a
fancy yellow dress. The mother rises and exits to the ladies
room while the little girl continues eating a large sundae.

Francesca smiles. As the girl licks a spoon of fudge, she
sees Francesca looking at her and smiles back. Robert watches
the silent exchange as he eats. Francesca makes a funny face
at her. The little girl giggles as she spoons more ice-cream.
Unfortunately, she spoons too much and the ice-cream falls on
her pretty dress. She tries to take it off her, but she slips
through her fingers and stains her even more. She looks at
Francesca as if she's about to cry. Francesca smiles.

          FRANCESCA
     Excuse me a minute.

Robert watches her cross to the little girl and kneel beside
her. He sees her consoling the little girl while taking a
napkin and dabbing it in the water glass.

She helps the girl carefully wipe away the mess, all the
while calming her. The mother re-enters the scene and shakes
her head at her daughter. The daughter is afraid of being
reproached but the mother is smiling. She and Francesca begin
talking. She thanks Francesca. Robert sees the two mothers
exchanging a moment of common experience and brief
friendship. The mother and daughter take their leave as
Francesca says goodbye and returns to the table. Robert looks
at her lovingly. Francesca returns to her meal, but suddenly
she is no longer hungry. Robert senses something is upsetting
her.

          ROBERT
     You're somewhere else, where?

          FRANCESCA
     Just that it's been a perfect day and
     that I'd like to skip my fancy
     dessert and go home after this.

          ROBERT
     Uh-huh. And?

          FRANCESCA
          (beat)
     You're right, you know. We don't have
     much time.

Uncomfortable silence hangs between them. A waiter passes by.

          ROBERT
     Check, please.

OS, as the MOTHER YELLS:

          MOTHER
     REBECCA! REBECCA!

Both Robert and Francesca look to the voice.

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

The mother stands on the street frantically calling for her
daughter.

          MOTHER
     REBECCA!

The Maitre'd, Francesca and Robert exit the restaurant.

          MOTHER
     Oh my God...!

          FRANCESCA
     What happened?

          MOTHER
     I was paying the check. She ran
     outside. I told her to wait for me
     right here! Oh God, where is she?
     Rebecca!

The sidewalk is filled with people. Francesca looks to
Robert. He recognizes the concern in her expression. Going
home will have to wait.

          ROBERT
     I'll check down here. Someone call
     the police.

The Maitre'd goes back inside. Francesca comforts the mother.

          FRANCESCA
     Think for a second. Is there
     someplace she said she wanted to go?

          MOTHER
     I don't remember!

EXT. STREET

Robert searches through the street, poking in and out of
storefronts, looking across the street.

EXT. RESTAURANT

Francesca and the mother search in the opposite direction.

EXT. STREET

Through the crowd of people, Robert looks across the four
lane Main Street to a LARGE CITY PARK. He crosses to it.

INT. RESTAURANT - AN HOUR LATER

Francesca sits with the mother as TWO POLICEMEN take down a
description. The mother is crying. A waiter brings over some
water for her. The Maitre'd stands by.

          MOTHER
     She was right outside. I turned my
     head for a second.

          POLICEMAN
     When was this?

          FRANCESCA
     About an hour ago.

          MOTHER
     They're not going to find her!

          FRANCESCA
     Yes, they are.

At that moment, the mother looks up and cries.

          MOTHER
     REBECCA!

She jumps out of her seat as all turn to see:

Robert holding the little girl in his arms, entering the
restaurant. He carefully hands her over to the mother. The
two wrap their arms around each other. Francesca looks to
Robert, loving him even more now.

          FRANCESCA
     Where was she?

          ROBERT
     Across the street. She went into the
     park and got turned around and didn't
     know her way out.

          MOTHER
     You crossed the street by yourself?!

          REBECCA
          (crying)
     It was a green light.

The mother is too relieved to be mad. Robert sits down.

          MOTHER
     Thank you so much!

          ROBERT
          (frazzled)
     I need a drink.

Everyone laughs out of relief. Francesca wraps her arm around
his shoulder and kisses his forehead. He kisses her back.

INT. TRUCK - DUSK

Robert drives as Francesca sits inside his arm. Neither speaks.

INT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DUSK

Francesca calmly leads Robert up to her bedroom.

INT. JOHNSON BEDROOM

Naked, Francesca guides Robert into bed beneath the covers.
They begin to make love -- softly, lovingly -- like a couple
that are beyond the erotic, discovery stage; a couple that
have been together and in love for years.

LATER -

Francesca puts her arm around him as he nestles his head to
her breast. Francesca strokes his hair as Robert closes his
eyes.

          ROBERT
     I don't know why I'm so tired all of
     a sudden.

          FRANCESCA
     Long day. Go to sleep.

          ROBERT
     Am I too heavy for you?

          FRANCESCA
     No.

Robert settles into her. But Francesca is wide awake.
Something is on her mind -- "Tomorrow? What happens after
tomorrow?"

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Francesca is serving Robert breakfast, then sits down beside
him. Silence. We can sense some tension between them -- this
being their last day together.

Francesca seems ingeniously friendly. Robert is suspicious.

          FRANCESCA
     Sleep all right?

          ROBERT
     Yes, thanks.

          FRANCESCA
     Good. More coffee?
          (he nods, she pours)
     Robert, I hope you don't mind my
     asking, but I feel like I should.

          ROBERT
     What?

          FRANCESCA
     Well, these... women friends of
     yours... all over the world. How
     does it work? Do you see some of them
     again? Do you forget others? Do you
     write them now and then? How do you
     manage it?

Her facetiousness startles Robert.

          ROBERT
     I... What do you want?

          FRANCESCA
     Well, I just want to know the
     procedure. I don't want to upset your
     routine. Do you want any jam?

          ROBERT
          (insulted)
     Routine! I don't have a routine. And
     if you think that's what this is -

          FRANCESCA
     Well, what is this?

          ROBERT
          (upset)
     Well, why is that up to me? You're
     the one who's married. You told me
     you have no intention of leaving your
     husband.

          FRANCESCA
     To do what? Be with someone who needs
     everyone and no one in particular? I
     mean, what would be the point. Would
     you pass the butter?

          ROBERT
     I was honest with you. I told you who
     I was.

          FRANCESCA
     Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit
     of not needing and that it's hard to
     break. I understand.
          (beat)
     Of course, in that case, why sleep --
     you don't need rest or for that
     matter eat, you don't need food.

She takes his plate away from him, rises and throws it into
the sink.

          ROBERT
     What are you doing?

          FRANCESCA
          (sarcastic)
     Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not
     cut out to be a World Citizen who
     experiences everything and nothing
     at the same time.

          ROBERT
     How do you know what I experience?

          FRANCESCA
          (angry)
     I know you! What can this possibly
     mean to anyone who doesn't "need"
     meaning -
          (mocking)
     "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who
     pretends he isn't scared to death.

          ROBERT
     Stop it!

          FRANCESCA
     You have no idea what you've done to
     me, do you? And after you leave, I'm
     going to have to wonder for the rest
     of my life what happened here. If
     anything happened at all! And I'll
     have to wonder if you find yourself
     in some... housewife's kitchen in
     Romania if you'll sit there and tell
     her about your world of good friends
     and secretly include me in that group.

          ROBERT
     What do you want me to say?

          FRANCESCA
          (nonchantly)
     I don't want you to say anything. I
     don't need you to say anything.

Robert rises, knocking his chair aside.

          ROBERT
     STOP IT!

          FRANCESCA
     Fine. More eggs or should we just
     fuck on the linoleum one last time?

          ROBERT
          (grabs her)
     I told you! I won't apologize for who
     I am.

          FRANCESCA
     No one's asking you to!

          ROBERT
     I won't be made to feel like I've
     done something wrong.

          FRANCESCA
          (angry)
     You won't be made to feel! Period.
     You've carved out this little part
     for yourself in the world where you
     get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a
     lover whenever you feel like it and
     the rest of us are just supposed to
     feel so incredibly grateful for the
     brief time you've touched our lives!
     Well, go to hell! It isn't human not
     to feel lonely -- it isn't human not
     to afraid! You're a hypocrite and
     you're a phony!

          ROBERT
          (cries out)
     I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!

          FRANCESCA
     WHY?

          ROBERT
     BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!

          FRANCESCA
     WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

He throws a cup at the wall. It breaks apart. Covering his
face, Robert turns away from her as he holds onto the sink.
Francesca reaches for him but he pulls away, embarrassed.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
          (softly)
     Don't you see, I've got to know the
     truth, Robert. I've got to know the
     truth or I'll go crazy. Either way.
     Just tell me. But I can't act like
     this is enough because it has to be.
     I can't pretend I don't feel what I
     feel because it's over tomorrow.

Robert, keeping his face from her, tries to tell her:

          ROBERT
     If I've done anything to make you
     think that what's happened between us
     is nothing new for me -- is some
     routine -- then I do apologize.

          FRANCESCA
     What makes it different, Robert?

Robert turns to face her. He is so hopelessly in love he can
hardly find the words. His eyes fill up with tears.

          ROBERT
     Because... if I even think about
     tomorrow -- if I...
          (voice cracks)
     even think about leaving here without
     you -- I'm not sure I can... that I -
          (he shakes his head)

He can't even finish. He kneels down before her wrapping his
arms around her and burying his face into her body. Francesca
starts to cry -- out of happiness, out of pain -- holding onto
him as if for dear life.

          FRANCESCA
     Oh God... what are we going to do?

She kisses him -- over and over, not wanting to be even an
inch apart. As if any space between them might separate them
forever.

Suddenly, OS, they hear a CAR DRIVE UP to the house. They
panic. Francesca runs to the window to see:

MADGE, a girlfriend, has come for a visit. Madge is holding
a homemade dessert.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd)
     No. No. Where's your truck?

          ROBERT
     Behind the barn. I better go.

Francesca turns to him -- speechless -- not wanting him to go.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     Don't worry. I meant upstairs.

He exits. Francesca gathers herself and heads for the front
entrance, quickly cleaning up the plates.

INT. FRONT HALL - DAY

Francesca opens the door to Madge.

          FRANCESCA
          Madge?

          MADGE
     Hi. I made some brown betty. I sent
     Floyd off to town with the boy. I said -
          (entering)
     "Floyd, I'm going to visit my
     girlfriend and spend the afternoon
     and that's all there is to it. He
     said who's going to make lunch? I
     said I'm taking a sick day. Eat at
     the dinner." Isn't that hilarious?
          (MOVES INTO KITCHEN)
     He didn't dare raise an eyebrow -- I
     don't even want to tell you how late
     he was out last night with those good
     for nothings from the Sandford ranch.
     I am so sorry, honey, I let two days
     pass before I came by, but with the
     boy home the time just escapes me.
     Have you heard from Richard? How's
     the fair? God, it's hot.

Following her into the kitchen, Francesca doesn't know which
question to answer first.

EXT. PORCH - LATER THAT DAY

Madge and Francesca sit facing the pasture beside a table
with coffee and brown betty. We parachute into the middle of
the scene.

          MADGE
     ... I said to her, "what's the point
     of summer school if all he's going to
     do are these art projects. The boy
     needs so much work in math and his
     spelling is a nightmare...
          (continues)

Francesca isn't listening. Her mind wanders.

FANTASY:

          FRANCESCA
     Madge. Please. Something's happened.
     I've met someone. I've fallen in love
     in a way I've never thought could
     happen my entire life. It's our last
     day together. I feel like I'm going to
     die when he leaves. Please. Help me.

          MADGE
     Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've
     got to be grateful for even feeling
     the little you've be given. Believe
     me. Go to him. Don't let him leave
     without these new precious hours
     you've got left. And if you need
     anyone to cry on, you know where I am.

END OF FANTASY:

Madge shoves a plate at her.

          MADGE (cont'd)
     More brown betty?

Francesca takes the plate. She can't think straight.

          MADGE (cont'd)
     ... Anyway, I'm glad that's over
     with. Sara doing so well though.
     Everyone thought I was crazy having
     them so far apart, but...
          (CONTINUES...)

FANTASY:

Francesca stands behind Madge, as the latter chatters on MOS.
She calmly picks up the brown betty and, from behind, shoves
it into Madge's face and holds it there, trying to suffocate
her with it. Madge struggles.

END OF FANTASY:

Francesca's mind races as Madge continues.

          MADGE
     ... without one lesson. The
     instructor couldn't believe it. So,
     who knows -- she may have talent.
     How's Carolyn doing? What are her
     plans for next year?

Francesca realizes this is her moment. She holds her head and
leans over, unsteadily.

          MADGE (cont'd)
     Honey, what's wrong?

          FRANCESCA
     I don't know. I woke up a little
     dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think
     I need to lay down.

          MADGE
     You want me to call the doctor?

          FRANCESCA
     No, no. I just didn't sleep well.
     I'm not used to sleeping alone. And
     this heat. Would you mind?

          MADGE
     No, of course not. I'll just clean up.

          FRANCESCA
     No, leave it. I'll do it later.
     Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come
     for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure
     Richard'll have so many stories to
     tell you both about the fair and all.

          MADGE
     Oh, that'll be nice.

                              CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Francesca enters to find Richard, laying on the bed fully
clothed. She sits beside him. He strokes her arm, then guides
her to lay down. Once she's in his arms, he speaks.

          ROBERT
     Come with me.

Francesca knew he was going to say this. Either answer she
gives frightens her.

          FRANCESCA
     Hold me.

She turns to him and they embrace. Robert, however, fears
only one response. On the soundtrack, we hear the song "DARN
THAT DREAM."

                              CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

The song continues over the next few images. Camera slowly
pans from the radio, upon which the song is playing, to a
beautifully set table and candles. It arrives on Robert
preparing dinner.

INT. BEDROOM

Camera pans the room from two OPENED SUITCASES, as Francesca
packs to leave. She moves about the room as if with blinders
on -- focused on her task, refusing to take in any sign or
memories that might hinder her. She is wearing a RED DRESS,
with BUTTONS down the front.

INT. KITCHEN

Robert stands at the sink rinsing out some utensils. Waiting
for the water to turn hot, he looks out through the window
above the sink. He sees a beautiful view of beautiful night.
He pauses as it strikes him that this is a view Francesca has
seen a million times -- that soon she would not see ever again.

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING

Camera follows her as she exits the bedroom with her
suitcases, then walks down the hall to the stairs, then down
the staircase to the front hall.

She quietly sets the suitcases down, hearing the radio and
Robert in the kitchen. She pauses, then enters the living
room. One of the throw pillows has fallen off the couch. She
replaces it then takes a moment to look about the room. She
slowly sits down on the couch.

We hear voices of the past, auditory memories conjured up by
each stick of furniture Francesca sees.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     Michael, get off the back of that
     chair! What did I tell you!

WE HEAR HIM FALL AND BEGIN TO CRY.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     All you all right, honey. Let me see...

A sound of Christmas music... of toddlers running and
laughing... A birthday party for Carolyn...

          CAROLYN (V.O.)
     Mama, look -- look at the dress Aunt
     Patty sent!

          RICHARD (V.O.)
     Franny, BONNAZA's on!

          ROBERT
     Francesca?

Francesca snaps out for it and turns to find Robert.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     I've got dinner.

She smiles.

INT. KITCHEN

They eat by candlelight. Neither speaks. Neither is very
hungry.

          ROBERT
     Would you like a beer?

She smiles and shakes her head. Robert opens a bottle and
takes a sip.

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     You know what I'd like to do before
     we leave? I'd like to take a picture
     of you -- at Roseman bridge. Maybe
     just as the sun's coming up.

          FRANCESCA
     Yes. I'd like that.

Pause. Robert smiles back and takes another sip. Then,
knowing full well what hangs heavy between them, he asks:

          ROBERT
     Tell me why you're not coming with me?

Francesca stops pretending to eat. She looks at him, having
forgotten how well he can read her.

          FRANCESCA
     No matter how I keep turning it
     around in my mind -- it doesn't seem
     like the right thing.

          ROBERT
     For who?

          FRANCESCA
     For anyone. They'll never be able to
     live through the talk. Richard will
     never be able to. He doesn't deserve
     that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his
     life.

          ROBERT
          (getting aggressive)
     Then he can move! People move!

          FRANCESCA
     His family's lived for almost a
     hundred years. Richard doesn't know
     how to live anywhere else. And the
     kids...

          ROBERT
     The kids are grown! They don't need
     you anymore. You told me that. They
     hardly talk to you.

          FRANCESCA
     No, they don't say much. But
     Carolyn's 16. She's just about to
     find out about all this for herself
     -- she's going to fall in love,
     she's going to try and figure out
     how to build a life with someone.
     If I leave what does that say to her?

          ROBERT
     What about us? What about me?

          FRANCESCA
     You've got to know deep down that the
     minute we leave here. It'll all
     change.

          ROBERT
     Yeah. It could get better.

          FRANCESCA
     No matter how much distance we put
     between us and this house, I bring
     with it with me. And I'll feel it
     every minute we're together. And I'll
     blame loving you for how much it
     hurts. And then even these four days
     won't be anything more than something
     sordid and... a mistake.

          ROBERT
          (desperately)
     Francesca, listen to me. You think
     what's happened to us happens to just
     anybody? What we feel for each other?
     How much we feel? We're not even two
     separate people anymore. Some people
     search their whole lives for it and
     wind up alone -- most people don't
     even think it exists and you're going
     to tell me that giving it up is the
     right thing to do? That staying here
     alone in a marriage, alone in a town
     you hate, in a house you don't feel
     apart of anymore -- you're telling me
     that's the right thing to do!?

          FRANCESCA
     We are the choices we've made, Robert.

          ROBERT
          (rises)
     TO HELL WITH YOU!

He turns his back on her.

          FRANCESCA
     Robert. Please.
          (desperate to explain)
     You don't understand -- no one does.
     When a woman makes the choice to
     marry, to have children -- in one way
     her life begins but in another way it
     stops. You build a life of details.
     You become a mother, a wife and you
     stop and stay steady so that your
     children can move. And when they
     leave they take your life of details
     with them. And then you're expected
     move again only you don't remember
     what moves you because no one has
     asked in so long. Not even yourself.
     You never in your life think that
     love like this can happen to you.

          ROBERT
     But now that you have it -

          FRANCESCA
     I want to keep it forever. I want to
     love you the way I do now the rest of
     my life. Don't you understand -- we'll
     lose it if we leave. I can't make an
     entire life disappear to start a new
     one. All I can do is try to hold onto
     to both. Help me. Help me not lose
     loving you.

She embraces him. He wraps his arms around her. He whispers.

          ROBERT
     Don't leave me. Don't leave me alone.
     Please.

This breaks her heart, knowing how hard it is for him to say
this. She holds him tighter, until -

          ROBERT (cont'd)
     Listen. Maybe you feel this way,
     maybe you don't. Maybe it's just
     because you're in this house. Maybe
     ... maybe when they come back
     tomorrow you'll feel differently.
     Don't you think that's possible?

          FRANCESCA
     I don't know. Please...

          ROBERT
     I'm going to be here a few more days.
     I'll be at the Inn. We have some
     time. Let's not say any more now.

          FRANCESCA
     No. Don't do this.

          ROBERT
     I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave
     it for now. We're not saying goodbye.
     We're not making any decision. Maybe
     you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll
     accidentally run into each other and
     ... and you'll change your mind.

          FRANCESCA
     Robert, if that happens, you'll have
     to decide. I won't be able to.

She cries in his arms. He kisses her as if for the last time.
Then, quickly, separates himself and leaves the house.

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE

Robert walks briskly towards his truck not wanting to look
back. He gets in, starts it up and drives away.

Francesca exits the house and watches the truck recede into
the distance. She stops when she reaches the front gate,
leaning against it. She murmurs to herself -

          FRANCESCA
     Keep going. Please.

The truck drives away. Then, suddenly, stops. Francesca's
heart quickens. She watches as the truck stands on the road
in the distance. As if Robert was deciding to turn around or
keep going. Francesca waits. Suddenly, the door to the truck
flies open and Robert exits. Francesca loses all restraint.

She opens the gate but her dress is caught on it. Robert
stands by the truck. Francesca tears at the dress, ripping
off a button which falls to the ground. She runs down the
road. Seeing her, Robert runs towards her as well.

They grab each other furiously. For these few moments, all
considerations are gone. As he kisses her, he murmurs:

          ROBERT
     I forgot to take your picture.

She laughs through her tears as they continue to kiss. Camera
pans up to the road beyond Robert's truck.

WE SEE RICHARD'S TRUCK DRIVING TOWARDS THEM. For a moment it
seems as if they will be caught until we realize RICHARD'S
TRUCK IS BEING SUPERIMPOSED as the LIGHT GRADUALLY BRIGHTENS
TO REVEAL:

MORNING.

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE

Richard, Michael and Carolyn drive down the road toward the
house. Robert's truck, and all traces of him, are gone.

Francesca steps into the doorway in a house dress to welcome
her family home -- wondering how this will feel.

JOHNSON KITCHEN - EVENING

The Johnson family has dinner as Francesca narrates:

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     You all came home. And with you, my
     life of details.

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE

Everyone is doing various daily chores.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     A day or two past and with each
     thought of him, a task would present
     itself like a life saver, pulling me
     further and further away from those
     four days.

INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Francesca is reading. Richard watches TV.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     I was grateful. I felt safe.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. WINTERSET - MAIN STREET - DAY

Richard and Francesca drive up to the general store to buy
groceries. Francesca heads for the store as Richard crosses
the street.

          FRANCESCA
     Want anything special for dinner?

          RICHARD
     Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat
     loaf you make?

          FRANCESCA
          (smiles)
     Okay.

She enters the store.

INT. GENERAL STORE - DAY

Francesca makes small talk with the grocery lady as she buys
what she needs.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

Francesca places a bag of groceries on the front seat of the
truck, then gets in herself to wait for Richard. She takes a
deep breath and removes a handkerchief from her bag to wipe
the sweat from her face. She freezes -

Through the windshield, she sees ROBERT standing beside his
truck across the street, staring at her. Her heart stops.
For a moment, she isn't even sure he's real.

The town moves about its business around them. But neither
notice or care. Whatever safety or forgetfulness she felt is
gone. Her feelings burst through. She sits there helpless
before him -- willing to go or stay depending on what he did.

He begins walking towards her. She prepares herself. Her life
will change -- it has to. There's not turning back.

But the closer Robert gets, the clearer he can see that she
is crying. And he stops.

Without any words, he realizes what taking her with him would
mean. With just a glance, he sacrifices her. With their eyes
locked in the middle of Main Street -- in front of the whole
town -- they smile and say goodbye.

Robert returns to his truck. He drives off down Main Street,
taking the first left.

Moments later, Richard throws the feed bag into the back of
his truck and gets in. Francesca is wiping her eyes.

He doesn't notice. He drives off in the same direction as
Robert.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     For a moment, I didn't know where I
     was. And for a split second, the
     thought crossed my mind that he
     really didn't want me -- that it was
     easy to walk away.

As they pass the corner where Robert made his left turn,
Francesca turns to look and sees:

ROBERT'S TRUCK IS PARKED just off the corner. As if he had to
drive away to get out of sight, but couldn't bring himself to
drive any further.

The sight of him hiding there breaks Francesca's heart, she
turns away from her husband to hide the tears.

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY

WE REPLAY THE OPENING SCENE FROM THE MOVIE:

Carolyn is in the yard picking vegetables. Her parents drive
up in their truck. She steps out with her bag of groceries
and walks briskly into the house. Richard follows more slowly
with his bag of feed, stopping at the gate to pick up the
button from Francesca's red dress.

INT. KITCHEN

Francesca enters and places her groceries on the counter. She
tries to compose herself. She sees the radio before her. She
turns it on. The Dinah Washington song "I'LL CLOSE MY EYES"
evokes every feeling of love and loss within her. She begins
to cry.

She hears Richard enter the house. She stands out of sight,
holding her hand to her mouth to muffle her crying. She hears:

          MICHAEL (O.S.)
     Dad! You bought the wrong feed!

          RICHARD
     What!?

She hears Richard exit the house.

EXT. LUCY REDFIELD'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A hand knocks on a door. Lucy Redfield opens it to find
Francesca standing there with a cake.

          FRANCESCA
     Hi. I'm Francesca Johnson. I just
     feel awful I haven't come to visit
     sooner. I hope I'm not interrupting
     anything. Is it too late?

Lucy is shocked and moved at the same time.

          LUCY
     No. Not at all.

          FRANCESCA
     I was wondering if... maybe you'd
     like some company.
          (almost manic)
     I baked a cake!

Lucy looks at the cake. She's a little dazed by all this.

          LUCY
     Uh... sure. Please. Come in. I'll
     make coffee.

Francesca enters. Lucy closes the door.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. IOWA LAKEFRONT - DAWN

Michael continues reading beside Carolyn as the sun rises.

          MICHAEL
     "We became inseparable, Lucy and I.
     The funny thing is, I didn't tell her
     about Robert until years later. But,
     for some reason, being with her
     somehow made me feel it was safe to
     think about him. To continue loving
     him. The town loved talking about the
     two of us but we didn't care. And
     neither did your father. Which I
     thought was a lovely thing. I
     received Robert's letter and my
     photograph soon after. I always
     wondered if your father found them.
     I was never quite sure..."

INT. KITCHEN - EVENING

At dinner, Richard remembers the button he found.

          RICHARD
     Oh, Franny, is this yours?

Francesca sees the button. She speaks her original lines MOS
as HER NARRATION is hard:

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     I almost told him. In that moment I
     felt as if I couldn't hold it back.
     If he really loved me maybe he'd
     understand.

She returns to her meal. The family eats in silence.

          FRANCESCA (cont'd; V.O.)
     But love won't obey our expectations.
     Its mystery is pure and absolute.
     What Robert and I had, could not
     continue if we were together. What
     Richard and I shared would vanish if
     we were apart. But how I wanted to
     share this. How would our lives have
     changed if I had? Could anyone else
     have seen the beauty of it?

INT. JOHNSON KITCHEN - NIGHT

Francesca moves about the kitchen with a frantic pace as she
puts the finishing touches on a cake. Placing the frosting
bowl in the sink, she hears someone upstairs exiting their
bedroom. She quickly gathers the cake and her bag and exits
through the screen door.

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - NIGHT

Fighting tears, she walks to the truck from around the house.
She gets in and starts it. She vaguely hears her daughter
from the front door.

          CAROLYN
     Mom?

But she doesn't acknowledge it and drives away.

EXT. MOTOR INN - NIGHT

Her truck approaches and then speeds past the Inn where
Robert is staying. We can see his truck in the parking lot.

1979

INT. JOHNSON BEDROOM - NIGHT

And older Francesca cares for a sickly Richard. He lies in bed
beside an array of medicines and tonics. She wipes his
forehead with a cool cloth as he takes his pills.

          FRANCESCA
     Better?

He nods. She smiles. She shuts off the light and lays beside
him.

          RICHARD
     Franny?

          FRANCESCA
     Hmm?

          RICHARD
     I just want to say... I know you had
     your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't
     give them to you. I love you so much.

Francesca turns to him. She is so touched, tears fill her
eyes. She nestles close to him, wrapping her arms around him.

1982

EXT. DES MOINES

Francesca eats at the same restaurant she shared with Robert.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     After your father died, I tried to
     get in touch with Robert but found
     out he had left the National
     Geographic soon after the Madison
     County. No one seemed to know where
     he was. My only connections to him
     were the places we'd been to that one
     day. And so each week, I'd re-visit
     them.

EXT. JOHNSON HOUSE - DAY

Francesca greets a UPS man with an envelope and a package.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     And then one day, I received the
     letter from his attorney, with a
     package.

INT. JOHNSON LIVING ROOM

Francesca reads the letter informing her of Robert's death.
She then unwraps the package to reveal a MEDALLION with her
name inscribed and A PHOTOGRAPHY BOOK; a published collection
of black and white photos by Robert Kincaid entitled "Four
Days." Beautiful, dramatic black and white representations of
love and passion, loneliness and pain, and union. On the
front page there reads an inscription "FOR F."

          ROBERT (V.O.)
     "There is a pleasure in the pathless
     woods... There is a rapture on the
     lonely shore... There is society
     where none intrudes... By the deep
     sea and music in its roar... I love
     not man the less, but Nature more...
     From these our interviews, in which
     I steal... From all I may be, or
     have been before... To mingle with the
     Universe and feel... What I can
     ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal."

The quote is Byron's. She smiles with pride as she cries.

                              CUT TO:

EXT. IOWA LAKEFRONT - EARLY MORNING

Michael sits with his arm around Carolyn as they look out
over the lake. The notebooks are closed, but Francesca's
narrations continue over the next few scenes.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     There has not been a day since that
     I have not thought of him. When he
     said we were no longer two people, he
     was right.

INT. JOHNSON BEDROOM

Carolyn, looking through her mom's closet, finds the summer
dress she bought in Des Moines to wear for Robert.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     We were bound together as tightly as
     two people can be. If it hadn't been
     for him, I don't think I would have
     lasted on the farm all these years.
     Remember that dress of mine you
     wanted, Carolyn -- the one you said I
     never wore. Well, I know I was silly.
     But to me, it was as if you were
     asking to wear my wedding dress to go
     to the movies.

Carolyn smiles as she holds the dress before her.

INT. MOTEL - DAY

A tired Michael finds his way through the motel to his room.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     After reading all this, I hope you
     can now understand my burial request.
     It was not the ravings of some mad
     old lady. I gave my life to my
     family. I wish to give Robert what is
     left of me.

INT. MOTEL ROOM

Michael enters to find his two children watching TV and an
angry Betty folding clothes.

          CHILDREN
     Hey, Dad!

He looks at them lovingly, then at Betty who angrily motions
for him to follow her into the bedroom.

She slams the door behind him and talks in a irate whisper.

          BETTY
     You have been out all night long! Do
     I have a right to ask where you've
     been or is this a family secret?

Michael just looks at her. He gently takes her hand.

          MICHAEL
     No. No more secrets.

He kisses her hand. Betty is floored.

          MICHAEL (cont'd)
     Do I make you happy, Betty?
          (she is stunned)
     Because I want to. I want to more
     than anything.

He gently kisses her cheek then embraces her. Betty -- for the
first time in her life -- is utterly speechless.

INT. JOHNSON BEDROOM

Wearing her mother's dress, Carolyn sits on the bed holding
the phone, waiting for Steve to pick up. In her other hand,
she holds the divorce lawyers card.

          CAROLYN
          (on the phone)
     Hi, Steve? It's me. Good. You?...
     Listen, we have to talk... Well,
     how about you?... Uh, no -- I've
     decided I'm going to stay for a
     while... I don't know how long...
     No, I won't be coming back...
     I'm not angry, Steve. I'm not angry
     at all.
          (smiles)

                              CUT TO:

EXT. ROSEMAN BRIDGE - DAY

Michael and his family stand beside Carolyn and a Priest.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     "I gave Lucy his photography book. If
     you're interested, take a look. If my
     words still leave something unclear,
     perhaps his pictures can illuminate.
     After all, that's what an artist does
     best... "

Michael receives the urn from the priest. He and Carolyn walk
away from the group towards the bridge. They stop. Carolyn
removes the lip. Michael sets his mother's ashes free.

          FRANCESCA (V.O.)
     "I love you both with all my heart.
     Do what you have to, to be happy in
     this life. There is so much beauty."
