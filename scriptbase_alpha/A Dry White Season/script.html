</b><b>PRE-TITLE:
</b>
<b>FADE IN:
</b><b>EXT. DAN PIENAAR SECONDARY SCHOOL FOR BOYS - DAY
</b>
Dan Pienaar school is a typical Johannesburg Afrikaan
school. The students are mainly from middle-class
families. School athletics are in progress. The stu-
dents, in their smart school uniforms, are cheering
enthusiastically a relay race on the immaculately-kept
sports ground.
GORDON NGUBENE, a 47-years-old African laborer is work-
ing in the school garden. A few feet away is his 15-
years-old son JONATHAN leaning against a wall watching
the games.
BEN DU TOIT, a 50-year-old Afrikaaner history teacher, is
enthusiastically cheering his son JOHAN, a 15-years-old,
who is leading neck-and-neck with another boy in the last
leg of the race. The excitement increases as they
approach the tape. Ben is beside himself, egging his son
with shouts. The young teacher, VIVIERS, standing next
to Ben, is shouting "come on Johan," and slapping the
father on the back.
Johan breasts the tape just ahead of the other boy. The
ground is invaded by boys running to congratulate Johan.
Ben hurries towards his happy but exhausted son; the proud
father pushing his way through the animated boys. As he
reaches Johan he pats him on the back.
<b>                           BEN
</b>             This was your best race.
<b>                           JOHAN
</b>                    (excited)
             I beat him, Papa.

<b>                           BEN
</b>                    (proudly)
             You did son. Come on, shower.

They walk happily towards the school buildings in conver-
sation, Johan being slapped on the back by friends. Ben
stops to talk to Gordon who jumps to his feet.

<b>                         BEN
</b>           I'll be expecting you. There
           isn't much to do, only weeding
           the marigolds and watering the
           lawn and flowers.

<b>                                             (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                         2.
</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                           GORDON
</b>             We'll be there, Mr. Ben'sir,
             Jonathan come to help me.
Ben hadn't seen Jonathan.    He turns to him.

<b>                           BEN
</b>             And how's the algebra?   Still
             giving you trouble?
<b>                           JONATHAN
</b>                    (with respect)
             Just a little, Mr. Ben'sir.
<b>                          JOHAN
</b>             Me too.

<b>                           GORDON
</b>                    (straightening himself)
             He's working hard, Mr. Ben'sir,
             and your money will not be
             wasted. Emily and me will always
             thank you.

<b>                           BEN
</b>                    (as he leaves)
             See you both later.
Gordon returns to his work a little distance further. A
group of students are laughing and pushing each other
boisterously. As they near Jonathan, two nudge each
other and giggle. Then, one of them trips Jonathan. He
falls to the ground and jumps up aggressively, about to
attack the boy. Gordon shouts "Jonathan."
The headmaster, MRS. CLOETE, aged 65 years, has observed
the incident, but takes no action.

Jonathan stands panting with rage.       He suddenly strides
away towards the gate in a rage.

<b>                           GORDON
</b>                    (shouting angrily)
             U ya phi?
             (Where are you going?)

Jonathan turns to look at his father and continues to
walk off.
<b>TITLES.
</b>
<b>EXT. SOWETO BEER HALL - AFTERNOON
</b>The beer hall is a large complex with a drinking area
with long rows of low benches.
<b>                                           (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                      3.
</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>Men sit drinking African beer in one-half and one gallon
plastics containers. The place buzzes with noise.
Several people are touting wares for sale.
Suddenly a group of about twenty youths walks into the
drinking area, obviously to cause trouble. The LEADER
starts to address the clients.

<b>                           LEADER
</b>             Your children are starving and you
             are drinking. We demand freedom
             and our fathers are drunk. We ask
             you to boycott these beer halls.
             Revolution and drink don't work
             together!

A large MAN WITH SIDEBURNS, obviously drunk, stands up, a
stick in his hand.
<b>                           MAN WITH SIDEBURNS
</b>             Since when do children talk like
             this to their fathers? They need
             thrashing.

The man and several others advance on the boys. The boys
run into the serving area, close the doors and start
breaking up the place. Two police Land Rovers SCREECH to
a halt outside. The boys run out through a side en-
trance. They are chased by the police who are black.
Jonathan and his best friend Wellington, also 15 years,
are walking towards the beer hall when the boys come
running out chased by the police. It is prudent for
them to run down the street. The boys and police are
bearing down on them. Their escape is cut off by the
apperance of another police Land Rover. Two policemen,
two blacks and two whites join in the capture. Jonathan,
Wellington and about ten of the boys are arrested.
As they are hundled into the vehicle, they protest their
innocence without success and are driven away.

<b>INT. SOWETO POLICE STATION - CHARGE OFFICE - AFTERNOON
</b>The charge office is sparcely furnished with a long bench
along a wall. There is a reception counter with Sgt:
Van Zyl in charge. The boys are lined up against a wall.
The sergeant stands with a tall blond man with a scar on
his chin, CAPTAIN STOLZ.

<b>                                             (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                       4.
</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>The sergeant reads out a name and    looks at Stolz; if he
nods the boy stands aside. After     this ritual, the ones
that Stolz has chosen are marched    to a waiting police van
and driven away. The others are     taken to the cells at
the police station, these include    Jonathan and
Wellington.

<b>EXT. DUTCH REFORM CHURCH - DAY
</b>The MUSIC STOPS. The doors open. The 40 years-old-
minister Bester comes to the door, then stands and greets
his parishioners as they file out of the church.
Amongst them, Ben Du Toit -- his wife, SUSAN, a clean-
cut, immaculate, "toe-the-line" beauty and his son, Johan
-- the blond, blue-eyed, tanned and torsoed fourteen-
year-old every father dreams of. Susan greets friends
and acquaintances, pausing to chat... mostly formalities.
Johan, his eyes on a girl his age. She is with her
father, Mr. Cloete, the headmaster -- she smiles at Johan
from a distance; he waves awkwardly as she drives off
with her parents.
SUZETTE his daughter, sophisticated -- groomed. She
takes her baby from the black nanny waiting in the car,
carries the child to the group chatting with CHRIS, her
husband. She shows it off proudly. Ben is chatting,
concerned, to a WOMAN. She looks drawn and worried.

<b>                           MRS. COETZEE (WOMAN)
</b>             He won't come to church. He lies
             in bed all day, listening to his
             headphones.

<b>                           BEN
</b>             I wondered why he wasn't at
             school. Would it help if I came
             to see him? He's always seemed a
             good kid to me.
<b>                           MRS. COETZEE
</b>             Oh, would you?
<b>                          BEN
</b>             Of course. I'll phone and we can
             fix a time.

Mrs. Coetzee smiles her gratitude.
<b>                           SUSAN
</b>             Ben!   Ben!

She's waving impatiently at him.     He crosses back to her.
Suzette's BABY is HOWLING.

<b>                                             (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                        5.
</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b>She rocks it back and forth, holding it at arm's length.
The BABY SCREAMS. The nanny comes forward -- Suzette
hands it over.
<b>                             SUSAN
</b>             Mrs. Coetzee.    She looked worried.

<b>                           BEN
</b>             She's having trouble with her boy.
             He won't come to school.

<b>                           SUSAN
</b>             So you said you'd have a word with
             him?

<b>                             BEN
</b>             Yes!
She smiles and walks him to the car affectionately.
<b>EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - BARBECUE - DAY
</b>The Du Toit family.

Susan is bringing out the salads. Chris, her son-in-law,
is at the barbecue, stinging his eyes. Ben is bouncing
his grandson, little Hennie, in a small, portable pool.
The black nanny sits in attendance in the shade, a towel
at the ready. The good life...
... Suddenly disturbed by... Gordon and Jonathan standing
uncertain at the far side of the garden; Gordon's hat
pressed flat against his chest, Jonathan defiant.

Susan looks up -- as do each in turn -- curious at the
intrusion... then the black nanny -- and finally Ben.
After a moment, Ben walks up to Gordon.

<b>                            BEN
</b>             Gordon!   What are you doing here?

<b>INT. BEN'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b>Six cuts, like six knife gashes, revealed on the blood-
stained buttocks of Gordon's son, who stands in painful,
truculent embarrassment.

Ben is shocked by the severity of the canning.
<b>                           GORDON
</b>             That's not why I'm complaining,
             Mister Ben, sir. If he did wrong,
             I'd beat him myself. But he
             didn't.

<b>                                               (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                           6.
</b>
<b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                           GORDON
</b>             He did nothing and they wouldn't

Outside, peering     through the half-opened door, is Johan,
shocked at what     he sees. Ben tapes Jonathan on the head,
he pulls up his     shorts painfully, yet fiercely, anxious
to cover himself     up again.
<b>                           GORDON

</b>School grounds of the Orlando Secondary School. Students
are milling around in high spirits. One group is putting
finishing touches to a banner reading: "no to aparhteid
education."
There are two other banners being carried around the
school yard, followed by the younger children. They
read:
             "No to the Oppressor's language"
             "Bantu education is slave
             education."
A BOY, one of the eldest, aged about 18 years calls for
silence. The STUDENTS immediately obey.

</b>             You all know why we are going to

             'No to apartheid'

             the younger ones. Let's go.
The Students start marching led by one of the banners,
singing a freedom song.

Amongst them is Jonathan and Wellington. They are sing-
ing. The march turns round one of the streets.

<b>CROSSROAD
</b>
Several groups of students marchers converge to join the
march that has already started, including Jonathan's
group. There are several banners condeming Bantu
education, apartheid, etc.

</b>            'If we learn Afrikaans vorster
            must learn Zulu.' 'Bantu

            Stinks!' 'Equal education! Now!
            Now! Now!'
They also start singing a freedom song.

<b>FURTHER UP STREET
</b>Three police Jeeps block the route of the march. A
little distance behind are police troops carriers
('hippos'). About six police-dog-handlers in camouflage
uniforms stand across the road waiting for the march to
approach.

As the march gets closer the students' singing increases
in volume.
The Soweto   police COMMANDANT steps forward with a loud-
speaker in   hand.  He confronts the lead of the march. He
signals for   them to stop. The dogs are straining at their
leashes and   their handlers taunt the leading group.
<b>                          COMMANDANT
</b>            Now listen to me, this is an
            illegal demonstration. I order
            you to disperse immediately.

The Students start singing the African national anthem
'Nkosi Sikelele.'
Children of 8, 9, 10 years singing lustily with their
fists clenched as everyone else.
Jonathan and Wellington singing.

Camouflauged police scrambling out of Jeeps with guns and
tear gas grenades. They stand with the rifles pointing
at the marchers. The singing continues.
The Commandant confers with a junior officer who hurries
to the group of policemen and gives them instructions.
The ones carrying tear gas move towards front. The
police start donning gas masks.

             take action.
A voice in the crowd shouts "Banutu education..."

The crowd shouts back "Stinks, Stinks, Stinks."
The Commandant gives a hand signal.

Tear gas canisters are thrown into the crowd, the dog-
handlers attack. There is panic with Students running in
all directions, several choking.

Some of the students start throwing stones at the police,
hitting one in the face; he is helped away by a black
policeman.
Without warning, SHOOTING STARTS.
Children drop, wounded; friends trying to help the dying
and seriously wounded, others helped away.

Some boys appear with dustbin lids as protection and they
pelt the police with stones.
The police in the 'hippos' are jumping off and pursuing
Students, some SHOOTING.
Woman grabs two of the running children age about 9/10
and hustles them into house.
Jonathan and Wellington are running with      a group.  In the
distance the sound of an AMBULANCE SIREN.       A Jeep cuts
off their escape, they turn back running      as SHOTS are
FIRED towards them, a little girl drops,      shot in the
back. Jonathan shouts to Wellington who       is ahead of him.
<b>                            JONATHAN
</b>             Wellington!   Wellington!

Wellington looks back, sees Jonathan trying to help the
little girl. He runs back to help. Another girl, aged
about 17 years, is also trying to help.

Two policemen suddenly appear from behind a house, they
are about 18 years old.
The girl straightens up and confronts the two policemen
shouting hysterically.

<b>                            GIRL

</b>She slumps to the ground crying.

Jonathan, Wellington and the Girl are hustled into a
crowded van amid punches and kicks from the police. The
van drives off leaving the injured Girl on the road,
neighbors run to assist the Girl.

As the van is passing, see a burning car, in the distance
a building on fire; another AMBULANCE SIREN.

The train enters Soweto, there is smoke hanging over sev-

fire.

Suddenly, the passengers are gripped by the seriousness of
the situation.
There are snatches of conversation such as:

             on fire."
             "I hope the children are home."

others naked, some mutilated,    others whole and seemingly
unharmed, as if asleep, until    the small, neat hole in
temple or chest and the small    crust of blood is brought
to our attention.

A woman behind them starts to scream. They look around
to see her holding onto a drawer, her legs buckling.
Another woman pulls her close to grieve with her. The
assistant approaches them and after a soft exchange he
writes a name on a tag and ties it onto the body. The
woman can't, won't leave her dead child. Her friend has
to pull her away.

</b>The crowd parts to let them through.    Other women reach
out to touch her.

Gordon looks into the last drawer, Jonathan is not there.
They make their way out past the other parents and a group
of mourning women sitting.

<b>EXT. MORTUARY - DAY
</b>Gordon, Emily and their friends cross to Stanley's great
white elderly Dodge, this "etembalami" with the big butter-
fly. For, amongst other things, he is the owner and
driver of a pirate taxi.
They get in. Stanley pauses -- looks across at a small
red VW Beetle parked nearby, waiting. He shakes his
head -- the VW flashes its lights and drives off.
<b>INT. STANLEY'S TAXI - DAY

Only Emily silently whispers "Thank God, thank God."

He's intense, unsmiling, burdened as he goes about his

Sounds of BEN and JOHAN LAUGHING coming from inside.

</b>
Ben and Johan, in robes, their hair still wet from their
showers, having an imaginary boxing match. Johan has
Ben on the ropes, backs him out of the house.

towards Johan, as he sees Gordon.

No response.   Ben does a double-take and stops playing.

He crosses the yard to Gordon, fluffing his hair dry,
Johan follows behind.

<b>                        BEN
</b>          Gordon, you okay?
No response again. Gordon continues to work.     Ben and

carpeted. A black woman cleaner is finishing off her
early-morning chores, packing up as white staff are be-

-- whipping the covers off typewriters.
A young black girl, smart, well-groomed, is carrying a
tray of coffee, desk to desk. FOLLOW her as she

<b>INT. GORDON'S HOUSE (SOWETO) - NIGHT
</b>The small dark room is crowded. The one oil lamp -- on
the table -- At the table sits Gordon... his glasses on
the end of his nose.
Emily is sitting by the stove.      Robert stands beside her
chair, watching, listening.
The youngsters are sleeping in opposite directions on the
iron bed.

Wellington is sitting beside Gordon at the table. There
is something wild in his manner. He looks everywhere as
if he is scared of being attacked unawares.
The black cleaner from John Vorster Sq. stands near the
table. Gordon is reading aloud from a handwritten
document.

<b>                           GORDON
</b>             'On the second day of our detention

             We were ordered to undress and
             they started to beat us with fists
             and sjamboks. This for a long

Wellington nods and gets more paranoid. The black cleaner
puts an understanding hand on his shoulder.

the image.

             One day I heard Jonathan being
             beaten. He was screaming and
             crying, and then a noise like

             down, and Capt. Stolz shouting
             "you bastard, get up, do you hear

             get up." Then the next day I
             heard he had gone to hospital and
             I never saw him again.'
There's a long silence. Gordon closes his eyes and
struggles with his grief. Emily sobs, Robert looks on
in anger. Then, finally, Gordon offers a pen to
Wellington, who is about to sign the foot of the state-
ment, when...

... Suddenly there   is the sound of a TRUCK APPROACHING.
Wellington rushes   to the front window and peers outside;
then panics, fear   in his eyes, he runs into a bedroom and
jumps through the   window.

Everyone in the room is bewildered.
The front door bursts open. Emily sits impassively look-
ing at the five policemen (two whites and three Africans).

The youngest child startled from his sleep starts to cry.
Emily goes to the bed and picks the child up and returns
to her chair.

looks at them and realizes their importance.

Capt. Stolz walks into the room and surveys the room and
its occupants. Lieutenant Venter hands him the papers.
He goes through them, nodding to himself as he reads
silently. He folds them neatly and puts them into his
inside jacket pocket. He walks up to Gordon.

<b>                           STOLZ

<b>                           STOLZ
</b>             We know each other, don't we?

Calmly, he paces round the room looking around, then when
he reaches the bed where the 10-years-old girl is watch-
ing terrified, he pulls off the blankets, yanks the girl
off the bed by her arm and frantically searches the bed.
The child cries. Robert the brother goes to his sister
and hugs her as he glares at Stolz with anger and hatred.

The other policeman appears from the other bedrooms empty-
handed. Gordon and the cleaner are roughly handled as
they are handcuffed by the African Security Police.

Over his shoulder Gordon manages to give Emily one last
look, as he's hustled out of the house.

<b>INT. BEN'S STUDY - NIGHT
</b>
Behind Ben's house, are the servants' quarters attached
to the garage.
Ben has adapted what would have been a maid's room into
his study and the adjoining room into a do-it-yourself
workshop.
The study has photographs of Ben's past as a provincial
rugby player, of his family, school staff and TRECHIKOFF
reproduction.
On a cupboard are trophies of individual sports at
university.
He works off a plain desk on which is a handsome pipe-
rack with several pipes. His indulgence is a comfortable
easy chair.
Ben's study, containing only the figure of Ben. He's
hunched over his desk, looking blankly at the newspaper.
His shirt is unbuttoned, his jacket slung across his
chair. He draws heavily on his pipe, wreathing his
head with smoke in the beam of the single desk light.
He sits in his chair:

Gordon's voice rises in his thoughts.

</b>Gordon stands facing the wall, his arm raised.    He has
wetted his trousers.

Captain Stolz is pacing behind him. Lieutenant Venter,
sitting on the edge of the desk, is smoking.

<b>                        STOLZ
</b>          Come on, Kaffir, talk!
<b>                        GORDON
</b>          Please, I've done nothing.   All I
          tried to do was to find...
Stolz interrupts him with a blow to his face.    As Gordon
drops his hands, the officer shouts to him.

<b>                        LIEUTENANT VENTER
</b>          Up with those bloody arms!
<b>                        STOLZ
</b>          We don't like gramophone records
          here! Now who has been giving
          you informations?

Gordon doesn't answer.
The Lieutenant walks slowly to him, calmly removes his
fag-end of cigarette from his lips and stubs it on
Gordon's neck.
<b>                        LIEUTENANT VENTER
</b>                 (very calmly)
          Why don't you answer the Captain,
          han?
He walks back to his place.

Captain Stolz opens the door and shouts:
<b>                          STOLZ
</b>          Johannes!    The bag!

Gordon has a look of terror.
Immediately a black security policeman walks in with a
bag.

<b>                         STOLZ
</b>          All right.

Johannes goes to wet the bag in a bucket in a corner.

Lieutenant Venter grabs Gordon, throws him onto a chair
and handcuffs his hands behind the chair.

The Lieutenant places the wet bag over Gordon's head and
ties it.
Gordon starts groaning and wriggling.

</b>
Under the gaze of a uniformed POLICEMAN in a bulletproof
glass cage, Ben fills in a slip, then hands it to the
Policeman, who then makes a phone call.

Whilst waiting, Ben notices a video surveillance camera.

Just then, a 20-year-old African girl, Afro-style hair,
is brought in held on both sides by two white policemen.
She is taken into a lift.
Ben watches them enter the lift and follows the progress
of lift to the 10th floor.
The Policeman stamps the slip and gives it to Ben.
<b>                           POLICEMAN

Ben enters a lift.
<b>INT. INTERROGATION ROOM (JOHN VORSTER SQUARE) - DAY
</b>Gordon's still sitting on the chair, slumped -- Johannes
removes the handcuffs as the Lieutenant removes the wet
bag.
Gordon is breathing heavily and semi-conscious.

Suddenly Captain Stolz punches him heavily on the face.
Gordon drops on the floor with blood gushing from his nose
and mouth. Captain Stolz grabs him by his collar.

<b>                           STOLZ

The PHONE RINGS.    Stolz drops Gordon and walks to answer.

<b>INT. VILJOEN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>Behind the large desk, Colonel VILJEON replaces the tele-
phone receiver; there is a KNOCK on the door -- and a young
policeman ushers in Ben. Colonel Viljoen stands and ex-
tends a hand.
<b>                        VILJOEN
</b>          Come in, Mr. Du Toit, come in.
          How do you do?
They shake.   He's a large, friendly man, ruddy face, gray
crew cut.

<b>                        BEN
</b>          Nice to meet you, Colonel Viljoen.

<b>                        VILJOEN
</b>          I used to watch you play for the
          Transvaal. You were one of the
          great wing forwards.
<b>                        BEN
</b>                 (grinning)
          Long time ago.

There's a KNOCK on the door.
<b>                        VILJOEN
</b>          Come in.

The door opens revealing Captain Stolz.
<b>                        VILJOEN
</b>          Captain Stolz, Mr. Du Toit.

Captain Stolz nods correctly, unsmiling, comfortably
dressed, English-style. He shakes hands with Ben. Then
walks toward the window and stands there.

As he's watching Ben, he begins to clean out his pipe with
a silver penknife;

<b>                        VILJOEN
</b>                 (to Ben)
          Do sit down.

Ben sinks into a low leather chair before the desk.    Be-
hind him he can feel Stolz's eyes.
Viljoen peers through his half-moons at the letter in
front of him. The pipe scraping continues behind Ben's
ear.

<b>                        VILJOEN
</b>          All right now, Gordon Ngubene.

             some kind of misunderstanding I

<b>                          VILJOEN

<b>                           BEN
</b>             I know him, Colonel. He works
             at my school. He's done work for
             me too.
<b>                           VILJOEN
</b>             And you feel you know him enough
             to vouch for him.

<b>                           BEN
</b>             Yes, after so many years... 10
             years. Gordon's not the type to
             get himself in trouble. He's an
             honest, hard-working, church-
             going man.
<b>                           VILJOEN
</b>             Ha! You'd be surprised how many
             honest, decent, church-going men
             we come across during a working
             day.

He leans back comfortably in his chair.
<b>                           VILJOEN
</b>             It's routine, Mr. Du Toit -- a

He looks directly at Ben, frank, open, trustworthy.

<b>                           BEN
</b>             Colonel -- believe me, I'm with

             innocent. After all, we're all
             human. We all make mistakes

Viljoen laughs again.

</b>             We are indeed, Mr. Du Toit -- we

There's another pause. The Colonel takes out a fountain
pen -- unscrews it -- and arranges a sheet before him
before speaking.

<b>INT. DUTCH REFORM CHURCH - MORNING
</b>
Dominee Bester is preaching from the pulpit.
<b>                           BESTER
</b>             God created the whole human race
             so that they could occupy the
             entire earth. He decreed how
             long each nation should flourish,
             and what the boundaries of each
             territory should be. Our task is
             to preserve that creative diversity.
Behind him, in his deacon's black tails, Ben listens with
clasped hands. On the opposite side, another man is lis-
tening, standing in the love of his family, Cloete.
<b>                           BESTER
</b>             Brothers and sisters, like our
             forebears, the Voortrekkers, who
             trekked into the wilderness
             preserve the Afrikanere way of
             life given to them by God. Today,
             we also live in times of great
             danger. Let not fear overcome
             you! Cling to the ways of justice
             and truth preserved by our leaders.
             So shall God be honored...
<b>BEN'S POV
</b>
The faces    of his friends scattered among the pews, Suzette
and Susan    listening intently, Johan beside her visibly
bored, his    eyes wandering to the Cloete's daughter at
the end of    the pew.

<b>                           BESTER
</b>             ... So shall the Afrikaner people
             flourish.

The organ plays the opening notes to a hymn, the congre-
gation rises and sings.

</b>Ben's garage/workshop -- the door is open. Ben and Johan
are together building a strong desk for Johan.

The RADIO offers MUSIC to keep them company.   Susan is
confronting Ben.

She turns the RADIO DOWN, irritably.

Johan is embarrassed. Ben glances at him. Johan shrugs
and shakes his head "not me." Ben planes on.

dirty streets, in wrecks of cars, open spaces devoid of
vegetables, smoke from large rubbish dumps, burnt-out
skeletons of buses, beer halls and buildings. Clusters
of policemen in battle dress patrolling in the distance.

hill cluttered with rusty tins, cardboard containers,
bottles.

<b>EXT. FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY
</b>A group of young children playing under the blinding sun
in a muddy ditch, notice the big painted butterfly on the
hood of Stanley's car.
They wave and scream at Stanley in their language and he
screams back at them.

Two little girls start running, heading toward the car.
Stanley notices the red VW parked in a corner. He man-
euvers and parks his car nearby.

faces, standing there waiting for him.

watch him go with the "white man."

<b>CHILDREN'S POV
</b>On the doorstep of the funeral parlor: Stanley and Ben
run into a young woman coming out with a shoulder bag
and a camera.
The young woman and Stanley exchange a quick, friendly
greeting -- it's MELANIE BRUWER, the Rand Daily reporter
-- and keep moving.
<b>BACK TO SCENE

Ben turns back for a moment. Her face seems familiar to
him. He would like to talk to her, but there is no time.
Stanley is already inside.
<b>INT. FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY
</b>Ben and Stanley follow the proprietor who is expensively-
dressed in a dark suit. Gordon's coffin stands as one of
many in the room.
Inside the casket, brass fittings, white satin, lies
Gordon, incongruous, ludicrous in a black Sunday suit.
His hands are crossed on his chest like the claws of a
bird and his face, barely recognizable, is gray, the left
side distorted, blackish purple.

There are rough stitches of the postmortem across his
skull and a scar on his lips.
Stanley speaks in an African language to the undertaker.
The man opens Gordon's shirt and reveals the bruised and
battered chest.

Stanley observes Ben who looks at the wounds with horror.
<b>
</b>Then another command from Stanley and the undertaker
opens the shirt to the waist. Ben's ashen. Stanley
thanks the man and turns to leave. Ben remains a minute.
He shuts his eyes tightly. Now he saw it. Now he must
believe it. He must accept that this battered corpse is
Gordon.
As he follows Stanley, he thanks the undertaker.

<b>EXT. FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY

Outside the "sunlight," the children's laughter and
Stanley, hands in pockets, waiting for Ben by the car.

The same two little girls approach Stanley who gives them
some coins -- they run off happily.
Ben is coming outside blinking in the glaring sunlight.
Stanley glares at Ben, who is pale, shaken and silent.
They get into the car in silence.

Stanley turns his RADIO ON and BANTU MUSIC invades the
car as it speeds away in a cloud of dust.

<b>EXT. SOWETO CEMETERY - MORNING
</b>The large Soweto cemetery has scores of graves ready for
burials. The chief mourners, Emily, Robert, his sister,
Margaret, four relatives and Stanley are standing on
either side of the PRIEST. Gordon's coffin is in the
grave; several wreaths are on the side of the grave.

There are about fifteen hundred mourners, and half are
youths. There are several local reporters and overseas
television reporters.
The police are in attendance in large numbers at the edge
of the crowd, some in battle dress and some with dogs.
<b>                        PRIEST
</b>          Before I conclude, I have to say
          we are tired of making this
          journey every day, sometimes twice
          in one day, burying our children,
          and those, like our departed
          brother, Ngubene who were merely
          seeking the truth; and those who
          have been denounced by traitors
          amongst us; and those who have
          been brutally killed for no
          reason, yes I shall say it, by the
          police. Let those who rule this
          land of ours listen to the word
          of God; let them listen to our
          peaceful and just demands; let
          them be humble and go down on
          their knees and seek forgiveness,
          then listen to God.
The crowd roars:   "Amanda!   Amanda!"
The Priest starts a short hymn and the crowd joins in.

At the end of the hymn.
<b>                        PRIEST

The funeral has now become a political demonstration.

Mr. Pilani, who is a dignified, educated 70-years-old,
walks slowly and waits beside the chief mourners. He
is handed a loudspeaker.

</b>A SENIOR POLICE OFFICER threads his way through the
crowd, a loud hailer in his hand. As he reaches the
grave he turns. The crowd is quiet. He says something
to the Priest then addresses the crowd.

             everyone to go home. This is not
             a political rally. I repeat,
             disperse.

As though by signal the police start attacking the
mourners with truncheons and dogs. There is pandemon-
ium, women screaming, people falling into graves or
covering in them.

The Priest and Stanley lead Emily and the family away
in the opposite direction.
The press and television are recording the scene. The
police start throwing tear gas canisters. There is no
confrontation, the crowd is fleeing in all directions.
One television cameraman is purposely pushed into a grave
by a very young policeman, his round recordist is pulled
up into the adjourning grave by the connecting cord.
Melanie stands on a tombstone watching and making notes.

he maintains through the streets of Soweto... using his
horn to scatter people out of his way, to the anger and
indulgence of others.

The CAR SCREECHES to a halt outside Emily's house.
Stanley gets out of the car and greets the startled
neighbors... and acknowledges the friendly shouts of
children.

Stanley looks around, then goes back to the car, opens
the back door, leans and says something. Suddenly, to
everyone's astonishment, Ben crawls out of the car;
Stanley hustles him into Emily's house.

Stanley waves at the people, a sign of assurance, then
closes the door behind him.

             assure you that I will do all I
             can to help you find out what
             really happened to Jonathan and
             your husband -- we cannot bring
             them back to life, but we can make
             sure that this sort of thing won't
             ever happen again.

</b>             You mean well, sir, but it's
             better to forgive. If we keep the
             pain alive then hate and
             bitterness will remain with us.

</b>             Mr. Ben is right. It's not that I
             want to go on with this thing
             because it's a bad thing that
             Jonathan died, that Gordon died
             that's hard enough to bear, but
             I can forgive it. But they
             covered Gordon's name with dirt
             and we must clean it up, else
             he'll never have peace in his
             grave.

</b>                    (to Ben)
             You must understand for us,
             suicide is a coward's way out, how
             do they say, it's a 'cop out.'
<b>                           BEN
</b>             Gordon wasn't a coward and we'll
             prove that. We have a very good
             advocate for the inquest. His
             name is De Villiers. I have
             confidence in him and the truth
             will come out.

A small group of youngsters are there, hands thrust into
their pockets, hanging around in a stony silence.
Robert is standing by the door.

Stanley calls one of them and talks to him -- the boys
look around and say something.

ruffles his hair.

the floor.

Some of the boys snicker and one bursts out laughing.
As Stanley gets into the car he shouts at them:

<b>INT. COURT ROOM - FIRST DAY OF INQUEST - DAY
</b>The inquest of Gordon Ngubene... conducted by MAGISTRATE

<b>                        DE VILLIERS
</b>          Dr. Jansen, you are a state
          pathologist of many years
          standing and I have no doubt a
          well-qualified pathologist.
          Could you now please tell us
          what caused the death of the
          deceased?
<b>                        DR. JANSEN
</b>          I found that death had been caused
          by the application of force to
          the neck, consistent with
          hanging.

<b>CONTINUED:
</b>There's a vigorous reaction to this around the court,
which gives us a chance to discover the crowd:

In the white section of the public gallery are Ben and
about eight other whites.

The black section is filled to capacity with a few stand-
ing. In the front row is sitting Stanley next to
Margaret. At the entrance, a white policeman.
In the press section are several reporters; amongst them
Melanie Bruwer the Rand Daily Mail reporter.
Colonel Viljoen and several policemen are sitting around
the court.

<b>                           DE VILLIERS
</b>             You are sure about the hanging?
             This pressure on the neck, could
             it also have been exerted in other
             ways?
<b>                           DR. JANSEN
</b>             It could, but it is not for me
             to speculate.
<b>                           DE VILLIERS
</b>             Of course not, Doctor. The list
             of injuries found on the body was
             horrifyingly long; bruises,
             swellings, abrasions, broken rib,
             lacerations, etc. How long before
             death do you estimate he received
             these injuries?
<b>                           DR. JANSEN
</b>             I couldn't say exactly.

<b>                          DE VILLIERS
</b>             Roughly.

<b>                           DR. JANSEN
</b>             Some were fourteen to twenty days
             old, others three to four days and
             others even more recent.

<b>                           DE VILLIERS
</b>             Even more recent. I see. I
             understand you had a Dr. Hassiem
             present at the autopsy.

<b>                           DR. JANSEN

<b>                           DE VILLIERS
</b>             Isn't it normal practice to have
             one report? Why did Dr. Hassiem
             decide to draw up a separate
             report? If he really co-signed
             yours.

<b>                           DR. JANSEN
</b>             That's for him to answer!
<b>                           DE VILLIERS

</b>             Acting on information we had
             received, I went to the house of
             the deceased, accompanied by
             Lieutenant Venter, Lieutenant
             Botha, and three native members
             of the security force. This was
             about 10 P.M. I informed Ngubene
             that he was under arrest under
             Article 6 of the Terrorism Act.
             He then became violent and resisted
             arrest. A certain force had to be
             applied to restrain him.

<b>                       STOLZ
</b>         Never. He was always treated with
         courtesy and correctness. But,
         one time we had cause to use force
         against him. It was the day before
         his death. The deceased suddenly
         showed signs of aggression. He
         tried to jump through the open
         window of my office. He was
         acting like a mad man. It took
         six of my men to restrain him,
         and he had to be manacled hand
         and foot, for his own safety.
         But once he calmed down, he was
         ready to make a statement about
         his activities. The next morning
         we found him dead in his cell.

to the crowd: "AMANDLA." The crowd responds: "Ngawethu."

strength in the prisoner's eyes.

</b>             I was interrogated by many special
             policemen, but mainly Captain Stolz
             and the one they call Venter. As
             they were searching somebody I
             know, they wanted me to tell them
             where that person was hidden. As
             I refuse to cooperate they beat me
             with a sjambok. After some time
             I fell and they kicked me in the
             face and stomach.

             threw a wet towel and started
             twisting it around my neck...
                    (she illustrates)

<b>                           MAGISTRATE
</b>             I have listened to all the
             evidence and the arguments. To
             begin with I have to say that
             there was no conclusive evidence
             offered to prove beyond doubt that
             members of the Security Police had
             been guilty of assault or any
             irregular conduct on the deceased.
             There were indications that
             Ngubene was aggressive and on more
             than one occasion had to be
             restrained with force. There was
             sufficient evidence to conclude
             that death had been caused by a
             trauma following pressure applied
             to the neck, consistent with
             hanging. Consequently, I find
             that Gordon Ngubene committed
             suicide by hanging himself and
             that on available evidence his
             death cannot be attributed to any
             act or omission or amounting to
             a criminal offense on the part of
             any person.

             Let me tell you about bees, and
             for that matter ants: a bee has
             a completely altruistic sense of
             purpose -- based on the common
             good. A course from which he
             cannot be deflected. Greed,
             ambition, they mean nothing to
             him. He lives solely to serve
             his fellow bee.

             ask the bees. I'm sure they have
             the answer. Now, you two run

He replaces his net and continues with the hive.

A shopping center in a white suburb.      Ben goes into a

As he walks out the other man turns around to watch him.
<b>EXT. STREET - MORNING
</b>
Ben walks    out of the shop. The newspaper under his arm.
A group of    three middle-aged women turn to look at him.
Ben didn't    see them. A little further on, he meets Mrs.
Coetzee.     He tries to greet her but she walks straight by.

Further on, he notices two men obviously talking about
him. Then a couple of boys on bikes snigger as they
pass him. He begins to wonder what's it all about, and
spontaneously checks his clothes.

<b>EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - VERANDA - MORNING
</b>Susan and Suzette sit there. Suzette's holding a news-
paper -- the Ossewa -- Susan's thoughtful, her face is red
and discomposed -- obviously she had cried. The PHONE
RINGS but they deliberately ignore it.
Ben appears with the newspapers under his arm, sees
Suzette's sports car and hurries to join them.
Suzette doesn't even give him a chance to kiss her.
<b>                           SUZETTE

             How's that, Suzette?

Ben takes the newspaper and looks at the cover. A picture
of himself and Emily outside the courtroom. The two faces
are close together with the notes:

             "EMILY NGUBENE, wife of native who
             died in detention, comforted by a
             friend of family, Mr. BEN DU TOIT."

And in parenthesis "see page two."
He throws the Ossewa on a chair and checks into the Rand
Daily Mail. Inside there is a long article with Emily's
picture, titled "the Face of Grief."

Ben folds up the newspapers, and shakes his head. He
suddenly realizes why the people reacted like that outside.

Before she can stop herself, Susan slaps him across the
face, although not hard. Johan leaves without a word.

conversation.

<b>INT. DAN PIENAAR SCHOOL - MORNING
</b>The staff is having coffee during morning break in the
staff room. The room has several easy chairs, a table with
the morning newspapers on it. The walls have pictures of
South African scenes.
There are several conversations in Afrikaans.   This is the
first morning since the photograph.

Ben walks into the staff room. The conversations stop.
Everyone looks at him with hostility. The teachers all
place their cups on the table and quietly file out of
the room.
Ben pours himself a cup of coffee; as he takes his first
sip, Cloete looks in, sees him. He walks in.

<b>                       CLOETE
</b>         I hope you don't mind us talking
         here.
<b>                       BEN
</b>         I don't mind, Mr. Cloete.
<b>                       CLOETE
</b>         I'll come to the point. You can't
         imagine how shocked I was by that
         scandalous photograph in the
         Ossewa.

<b>                       BEN
</b>         The woman lost her husband, she
         was shattered with grief.
<b>                       CLOETE
</b>         A Kaffir woman, Du Toit.
<b>                       BEN
</b>                (angrily)
         I can't see that it makes any
         difference.

<b>                       CLOETE
</b>         Have you gone color blind then?
         And what about the apartheid laws?
         Our first responsibility as
         teachers is the reputation of the
         school, the pupils entrusted to
         us. We have to be an example to
         them in and out of this school
         yard.

Ben looks at him calmly.

             Obviously you didn't heed my
             advice.  That's all I have to say
             for now.

Cloete walks out of the room.
Viviers hurries into the room, he is late for his
coffee.

<b>                           VIVIERS

Ben picks up the copy of the Ossewa with the photograph
and shows it to Viviers.
<b>EXT. MELANIE'S HOME - DAY
</b>
Ben stops the car in the Bruwer driveway. From the
driving seat he searches the garden for Bruwer.
He walks up to the front door and knocks, but there's no
reply. He goes 'round to the back and finds the old man
on his knees weeding his vegetable garden.
<b>                           BEN

</b>             What's the world coming to? It's
             herbs, can't you see? Thyme
             there, oregano over there, feunel
             next to the tomatoes, sage here
             and rosemary somewhere. Poor
             plants, they re not in their ideal
             soil or climate. Next time, I'll
             bring some soil from the mountain
             of Zeus. Perhaps the old man's
             holiness will do the trick.

He throws down the small weeding-fork.

He leads Ben to the two old chairs by the back wall. He
enters the kitchen and returns with a bottle of greengage
wine and two glasses.

<b>                            BEN

Professor continues.

<b>                           BRUWER
</b>             We are both Boers, Ben. We know
             how hard our people worked to get
             a toehold on this land; it was a
             good life. Now look at the mess.
             It's all systems and no God!
             Sooner or later people start
             believing in their way of life as
             an absolute: unmutable,
             fundamental, a precondition. Saw
             it, with my own eyes in Germany,
             a nation running after an idea.
             Sieg heil, sieg heil. I left
             there thirty years ago because I
             couldn't take it any longer. And
             now I see it happening in my own
             country, step by step.
             Terrifyingly predictable. This
             sickness of the great abstraction.

He farts and sips his greengage wine.

Ben takes a file from under a toolbox and measures it
carefully against the drawer base. Then, he selects a
piece of wood approximately the size of the drawer and
tries it for size.
We should be in no doubt that's he's constructing a
hiding place.

smiling.

Susan hugs her.

</b>             I'm getting tired of the trek to
             Cape Town and then back to
             Pretoria. If I had my way,
             Parliament and government would
             be in the same city. There's

</b>             That's for   holidays. Anyway, Ben,
             one of the   reasons for this visit
             was that I   wanted to have a

</b>             It's that photograph in the
             papers. Ben, a thing like that
             could be an embarrassment for
             someone who is a member of
             Parliament. It's a grievous day
             when one's family's behavior
             comes between him and his duty
             to the fatherland.

<b>                           FATHER-IN-LAW
</b>             I've been doing that all my life,

             member of our family has been seen
             with a Kaffir woman before, Ben.

Father signals the African waiter for more drinks.

It's a different city by night. The dark seems to soften
the violence of the confrontation, hiding the details

several GUNSHOTS in the distance. The only light comes
from the small, square windows of the innumerable houses.

they pass they hear HYMN SINGING from the house.

has pulled the lamp closer to read    one of two notes from
Gordon -- one is written on ruled    paper, the other a
square of toilet paper. The notes     have been smuggled out
of John Vorster Square.

<b>EXT. BEN'S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING
</b>A 40-year-old African woman walks up to Ben's kitchen
door. She knocks.

Ben opens the door in pyjamas and dressing-gown.    She
hands him a note and leaves.

Ben reads the note and goes back into the house.

<b>EXT. STREET IN VREDEDORP - MORNING
</b>Vrededorp is a colored section of Johannesburg. It's
rundown area vacated by whites. There are children play-
ing in the street. Some unemployed men are sitting on
old chairs outside a doorway; a vendor is serving two
women from his milk churn.

Ben drives into the street   searching for an address. He
stops outside a house. As    he gets out of the car the
children and everyone stop   to look at him with interest.
He walks up to a door and   knocks.
A COLORED WOMAN appears as the door opens.    She is young
and obviously educated.

<b>                          COLORED WOMAN

Ben nods, hesitatingly.

<b>                        COLORED WOMAN
</b>          Please, come in.
Ben walks into the living/dining room. It's a    very tidy
room with a three piece sitting room suite, a   sideboard
with a clock on it. At one end of the room is    the dining
area. The floor is linoleum and covered with    a rug in
the middle.

Stanley is lounging on a settee, beer in hand. On the
chair next to him a black man in a brown striped suit,
drinks orange squash. Thirtyish, pleasant face but very
tense. He rises as Ben walks in.

Sadie goes to a cupboard and brings out a bottle of beer
and a glass. She opens the beer and hands it to Ben.
She disappears into the bedroom with a curtain at the
door.

<b>                           STANLEY
</b>             Julius has been arrested. He
             broke his banning order and
             visited his sister. You know what
             that means? At least a year's
             imprisonment.

<b>                           BEN
</b>             A year in jail just for visiting

</b>             That's the chance he took. And
             he'll be the last to complain.
<b>                           BEN
</b>             Don't you think the real reason
             for this arrest was that they
             found out he was helping us?

<b>INT. BRUWER KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
</b>This is a medium-sized kitchen with two doors leading
from it, one to the dining room and the other to the
living room. It has not changed since it was furnished
twenty years ago, the only modern appliances being the
electric stove and a modern mixer on the working table.

Ben is leaning against the wall next to the door leading
to the living room, drinking coffee.
Melanie, bare-feet, her long black hair tied up in a
ribbon, is washing up. She looks younger and fragile
with this hair-style.

          we get on perfectly. We have
          been together since I was a year
          old. My mother could not adapt
          to South Africa. She went back
          to London and we've never heard
          from her since.
<b>                        BEN

</b>             Alright. I'll tell you. I was
             brought up in a sheltered way, not
             that Dad was possessive, not
             openly anyway. I think he'd just
             seen enough of the mess the world
             was in, to want to protect me as
             much as he could. Then, I went
             to university. I don't know what
             you'll think... being a teacher.

Pause.

<b>                           MELANIE
</b>             Fifteen years difference. He too
             protected me like Dad. Then one
             day I visited Dorothy in Alexandra
             and saw her home and the appalling
             conditions in that township. I
             was shocked, Ben, and ashamed.
<b>                           BEN

Melanie pours him another mug of coffee and starts to
wipe up.
<b>                           MELANIE
</b>             That made me think that I was a
             parasite, something white and
             maggot-like... just a thing... a
             sweet and ineffectual thing. I
             felt more and more claustrophobic.
             Poor Brian, who loved and pampered
             me. Had no idea what was
             happening. I left him for a whole
             year and we divorced.

<b>                           BEN

Melanie goes to the living room, as she passes Ben she
touches his arm and continues talking.

<b>EXT. SOWETO - EMILY'S HOUSE - MID-MORNING
</b>Parked outside the house is a municipality truck already
half-laden with Emily's furniture and possessions. Four
Africans in khaki overalls are loading the truck -- super-
vising the eviction of Emily are a white Soweto official,
Captain Stolz and Lt. Venter. In the b.g., a hundred yards
away is a "hippo" with black and white armed policemen.
Behind the truck are two police Land Rovers.

Emily is sitting outside on one of her chairs as neighbors
walk up to her to comfort her and say their goodbyes. Her
daughter is carrying the youngest child and standing next
to Emily -- several children are watching. A woman in
the crowd starts singing a freedom song: "UMZIMA
LOMTHWALO" ("THIS BURDEN IS HEAVY"). The song is taken up
by the other women.

Venter tries to stop them and disperse them. Stolz
signals to him to leave them alone. One of the Africans
then walks up to her for the chair. She refuses to get
off the chair. The man looks at the white official as
though to ask "what do I do." The official looks at
Stolz. Venter walks up to Emily and, about to pull her
off the chair.

<b>                        EMILY
</b>          Don't you touch me!
Venter pulls back. The women start to ululate. Emily
rises majestically, takes the youngest in her arms and
walks slowly to the truck followed by her daughter.
People cluster around her, singing with rage and shaking
her hand. Stolz observes the scene, impassive.

truck which drives away preceded by the police "hippo" and
escorted from the rear by the Land Rovers. The crowd
continues singing.

pass each other and Ben takes a good look at him and turns
back onto the streets to the local shops. The man decides
not to follow.

deserted. Only Viviers waiting for Ben under the veranda.

Ben appears.

Ben doesn't react.

<b>INT. BEN'S DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>Christmas day lunch. Assembled around the table are
Ben's Father-in-law, his wife Helen, Suzette and Chris,
her husband, Johan, Ben and Susan. They're all wearing
paper hats from Christmas crackers. On the table is a
large piece of roast lamb, ox tongue, a large turkey and
assorted vegetables.

Ben is at the head of the table adjacent to the door lead-
ing to the kitchen, the Father-in-law is sitting by his
side facing the door.

Ben is in the middle of carving the turkey, plates are
being passed to him.
<b>                       JOHAN
</b>         Was last year's turkey as big as
         this, Papa?
<b>                       BEN
</b>         About the same size.
<b>                       SUZETTE
</b>         Do you remember the turkey I had
         for Easter? You said it was as
         big as a baby ostrich, Papa.
<b>                       BEN
</b>         I don't remember that, Suzette.

<b>                       FATHER-IN-LAW
</b>         You know, Johan, when I was a boy
         in the Karoo, we used to fry
         ostrich eggs. You know how big
         they are?
<b>                       JOHAN
</b>                (laughing)
         As big as this table.
<b>                       BEN
</b>                (to Father-in-law)
         I think he deserves the parson's
         nose for that remark.
They laugh. Susan laughs. She does her best to compose.
Suddenly... a KNOCK at the outside kitchen door. As Ben
turns towards the door it opens and...
<b>INT. BEN'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON
</b>
... Stanley erupts into the kitchen like a great black
bull in white suit and white shoes. A scarlet tie is
matched by a huge handkerchief hanging from his pocket.
He is a little drunk.

                     laughing thunderously)
             Merry Christmas, everyone!
There's deadly quiet -- not even the clink of a spoon --
as the Du Toits look on aghast.

Slowly, as if in a dream, Ben rises and goes to Stanley
who spots him.

<b>                           STANLEY

chair and goes to the kitchen.

He strides into the dining room.
<b>INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>Susan sits   with her eyes tight shut -- trying to shut out
the horror   of it all. As the Father-in-law goes into
the living   room, he pulls back his wife's chair and helps
her to her   feet.

Chris follows. Susan also. From the living room, she
calls Johan who is left alone at the table, perplexed.
Johan goes to his mother.
There's a general rush for the door and, without warning,
the room is empty. Only the TIN ANGELS TINKLE merrily
around their candles.

          realize what you've done?

beside him, shaken, his face ravaged by the news.

suitcases, back down the path to his in-laws' car;
Father-In-Law shepherding his wife and an ashen, dazed
Susan, helping them into the car.

As they leave see Johan leaning against the dining room
door, watching his father and Stanley.

<b>                            BEN
</b>             Melanie.   Be careful.

<b>                           MELANIE
</b>                    (as she plays the
                     record and
                     flippantly)
             Of course, Ben.
She goes into the kitchen.

As Melanie hums to herself to     the BLUES MUSIC, in the
kitchen, Ben walks over to the     window and furtively
glances out, to assure himself     that nobody is watching.
He takes then a book on a pile     next to the settee and
pages slowly through it.
Melanie returns with two glasses, still in her happy
mood. She places Ben's glass on the side table next to
the settee, takes the book from him and makes him sit
down.

</b>             Do be careful. I wouldn't want

She reaches for his hand.

</b>                    (excited)
             That's my favorite, Ben.

Jumping up and taking Ben's glass and placing it on the
side table, she pulls him to his feet.
<b>                           BEN
</b>             I can't dance.
<b>                           MELANIE
</b>             Rugger player?
They laugh as they start to dance to the slow BLUES
MUSIC. The laughing subsides as they hold each other
closer. The dancing starts to lose the beat of the
music. They look into each other's eyes and Ben envel-
ops her tenderly in his arms hugging her as close as
possible against him.
They stop dancing.     Ben kisses her.   A long, warm and
tender kiss.

<b>INT. LOCAL SUPERMARKET - MORNING
</b>Ben is shopping at the local supermarket. He    is pushing
a trolley. As he places some groceries into    his trolley,
he notices a man standing near the check-out   counters.
The man is similar built as Jamie and similar   hairstyle.
He's reading a newspaper, his face concealed.

Ben drops the package he was inspecting, back on the
shelf and pushes his trolley towards the man to try and
see his face.
The man moves away. Ben follows him and has decided to
confront him. Man picks up a pack of ham.
Ben is about to remonstrate with him.

<b>                       BEN
</b>         Listen, you...
Just then a LADY and her daughter hurry to the man, push-
ing a trolley. Man turns to look at Ben.

<b>EXT. INDIAN TOWNSHIP - DAY
</b>Ben has parked his car in a street corner of the upmarket
section of the Asian township. He peers around him, then
walks away.
Ben knocks at a door.
The door is opened cautiously by DR. HASSIEM, a tall,
handsome Indian, aged 35 years. His clothes are casual
but expensive. His six-year-old daughter, large dark
eyes, is clinging to his leg. We recognize the little
girl of the photograph near the telephone, from earlier.

<b>                           BEN

</b>             Not for me, Doctor. I've got to

</b>             Dr. Jansen and I didn't disagree
             on the facts. After all we
             examined the same body in the same
             time. But just on the
             interpretation. For example, if
             Gordon, had really been hanged,
             the marks on his throat would have
             been concentrated on the front.
                    (he touches his
                     larynx)

             You see, through a misunderstanding
             I arrived at the morgue too early
             for the autopsy. There wasn't a
             soul around except a young African
             attendant. When I told him I'd
             come for the autopsy, he let me in.
             The body was on the table dressed.
             I noticed blood on the clothes.

<b>                            BEN

<b>                           DR. HASSIEM
</b>             As I examined the clothes more
             closely, a police-officer came in
             and said I wasn't allowed in the
             morgue before Dr. Jansen arrived.
             When I returned with Dr. Jansen,
             half an hour later, the body was
             naked.

             'A police spokesman when questioned
             said: "It's not the first time that

             We must keep going even more so

             going to die of bloody natural

is Melanie.
Stolz in sports jacket, standing next to the desk is
speaking... patronizing.

</b>             We're all made of flesh and
             blood, Mr. Du Toit -- we've all
             got our flaws. And if a man likes
             to sample the grass on the other
             side of the fence, well, that's
             his own business. But it would
             be unpleasant if people found out
             about it, especially if he's a

             threatening you... these

<b>                           STOLZ
</b>             Let's just say I may be able to
             use my influence to make sure that
             a private indiscretion isn't used
             against you.

Stolz looks past Ben.
<b>                           STOLZ
</b>             Is this your son?

Ben whirls around to see Johan at the door. He shoots,
puts himself between the photograph and his son obviously
surprised to find Capt. Stolz there.

<b>                           BEN

Johan walks away.

             has gone long enough?

<b>                           STOLZ

Ben answers by a gesture.
<b>                           STOLZ

                     cigarette)
             Now be honest. Has all the
             evidence you've been collecting
             in connection with Gordon Ngubene
             brought you closer to the truth

<b>                           BEN
</b>             Yes, I think so and there's more

A pause.
<b>                           STOLZ
</b>             I really hoped we could talk
             man-to-man.

<b>                           BEN
</b>             It's not possible, Captain.    Not
             between you and me.
<b>                           STOLZ
</b>             It's high time, Mr. Du Toit, we
             allowed the dead to rest in peace.
             I'm offering you a chance.

<b>                           BEN
</b>             You mean my very last chance?

<b>                           STOLZ
</b>             One never knows. It may not be
             important to you, but we have to
             survive.

<b>                           BEN
</b>             If we can only survive through
             murder and torture, then we have
             forfeited our right to exist.

Slowly and deliberately Stolz stubs out his cigarette
in the ashtray.

</b>             Before you go. I'll tell this,
             Captain. I have a pretty good
             idea of what I will eventually
             uncover. I mean the truth.
             And I won't allow anyone or
             anything to come between me and
             that truth.

Ben walks up to the door to see him out. There's no
response from Stolz. He calmly takes a small card out of
his pocket and rests it on Ben's desk.

<b>                           STOLZ
</b>             Here's my card -- my private line.

</b>             Goodbye, Captain, and don't forgt
             the photograph.

briefcase.

watches him get into his car and drive away.
Johan joins his father.

</b>Ben and Johan are standing in the public enclosure on the
top floor of the airport building. Ben is unshaved, he
looks tired, but happy. There is the usual bustle of
airport staff for the steps and luggage, two-thirds of
the staff being black.

Passengers emerge from the plane Melanie amongst them.
Some waving to friends and relatives on the public en-
closure. Melanie stops momentarily and looks up at the
enclosure. She sees Ben and Johan and waves at them.
They wave back and Ben indicates they'll be waiting for
her below. She walks off as they happily await her after
the ususal formalities.
<b>INT. JAN SMUTS AIRPORT - DAY

Ben and Johan are waiting outside the arrivals exit.
Several passengers stream out, some being met. Eventually
there is a trickle of passengers. An INDIAN WOMAN is one
of the last to come out. Ben approaches her.
<b>                        BEN
</b>          Excuse me, I'm waiting for a lady

Just then Stolz appears through the door. He slowly
walks up to Ben and Johan. Ben becomes apprehensive.

Ruffling his hair; Johan pulling away and glaring at him.
<b>                           BEN
</b>             What now, Captain?

<b>                           STOLZ
</b>             Word came to me that you were
             asking after your very good friend,
             Miss Bruwer. You know, subersives
             come in all guises and can be
             very resourceful. Now let's take
             your friend, she has been using
             her privilege as a journalist to
             endanger the security of this
             country. But you know something
             else? She has been secretly
             holding a British passport. A
             South African passport and a
             British pasport. Now you tell me,
             where is her patriotism? Her
             allegiance? The minister telexed
             to the immigration officers here
             declaring her an undesirable
             immigrant. So she is being put
             on the first available plane to
             London. This must be heart-
             breaking for you. Good afternoon,

Ben and Johan arriving at the house. An unsympathetic
small crowd is there waiting... They react, murmuring
in Afrikaans, watching them with hostility as Ben and
Johan get out of the car and discover the chaos. The
wreckage. The garage and Ben's study have been bombed.
Johan leaves Ben and rushes to the house. The crowd
starts to disperse.
The entire    tools cupboard has been methodically ripped
apart and    the contents strewn on the garage floor.
Everything    is half-burnt... charred... Ben has sunk onto
the stool    in total defeat. There's silence.
Then Johan appears at the door. He hands Ben a large
envelope -- in it, the file with all the papers. Ben looks
up at Johan.

of Ben with Suzette, a staff photograph, Ben amongst it,

Ben starts putting material relevent to his inquiries
into a large brown envelope.

             Wellington's affidavit. Melanie
             found him. She's being deported.
             The official reason is that she
             possessed a British passport. I
             don't know how she managed to
             smuggle the envelope to me.

</b>             Man, it's all happening!

Stanley walks out, glances at the devastated study. He
reenters the kitchen and slams on a chair. He takes a
packet of "Lucky Strike" from his pocket and offers it
to Ben

</b>             No, thanks.

Stanley lights a cigarette and surveys the table. He
picks up the half-burnt Picasso book, gives it a brief
glance, and tosses it back on the table and starts to
chuckle.

<b>                           BEN
</b>                    (surprised)
             What's so funny?

             They drop the bomb on you!
Ben walks up to him puts his hand on his shoulder.
There's an understanding trace of a smile on his face.

Ben sitting in a cafe smoking his pipe.   A waiter serves
him a glass of beer, for which he pays.

Without taking his eyes off her, he takes a brown envelope
from a chair and pushes it slowly towards the uncomfor-
table Suzette.
She picks up the envelope.

Suzette awkwardly kisses him on the cheek.

Suzette looks at him for a moment and hurries to her car.
As Suzette leaves, Ben turns back into the room, his
eyes glassy with tears.

The two cars approach following each other. As the second
car overtakes, he draws Suzette's attention with his HORN
and signals her to pull up.

As she gets out of her car holding the brown envelope,
Capt. Stolz gets out of the other side.
Suzette walks over to the passenger:      Colonel Viljoen.
