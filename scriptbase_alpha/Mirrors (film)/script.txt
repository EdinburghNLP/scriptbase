"I give you the secret of all secrets. Mirrors are the gates
through which death comes and goes. Tell no one."

1A   INT. NIGHT - HARLEM SUBWAY STATION                             1A   

     A subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform    
     somewhere in Harlem.                                                

     A man runs for his life in the deserted space. He's an African      
     American male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform.      

     He turns into an empty corridor, climbs a set of stairs towards     
     the exit, but- The gates are down and the station is closed.        

     Desperate and out of breath, he is forced to trace his way back,    
     searching for an exit or a place to hide. He sees a door to the     
     public restroom and runs inside.                                    


1B   INT. NIGHT - SUBWAY PUBLIC RESTROOM                            1B   

     The place is deserted as well. One of the mirrors is smashed        
     while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt -                 

     The neon lights are flickering, bringing the place in and out of    
     the dark.                                                           

     The man checks each stall one at a time.                            

     His face lights up as he looks inside the last one-                 

     A SMALL WINDOW ABOVE THE TOILET IS JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO       
     CRAWL THROUGH.                                                      

     He steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight.     
     After a brief struggle, he swings it open, only to discover-        

     A wall of bricks.                                                   

     Panic returns to his eyes. He slowly opens the stall door,          
     fearful of what could be waiting outside.                           

     A FAINT SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS is heard.                         

     He quickly shuts the door, holding his breath. Frozen.              

     Silence.                                                            

     His heart racing, he exits the stall in the direction of the        
     sound. The place is empty.                                          

     The room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights.          

     He moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror.      
     His image is fragmented and deformed. It resembles a Cubist         
     portrait.

                                                                 2.

                              MAN                                          
                  I'm sorry... I... I... I wasn't trying                   
                  to get away...                                           

     He talks to his own reflection in the mirror-                         

                              MAN (CONT'D)                                 
                  No, please don't...                                      

     He approaches and starts crying like a child. His head resting        
     against the mirror, he pleads for his life. Then, seeing the          
     dirt and grime on the mirror, his behaving shifts to another          
     extreme. He starts cleaning it frantically with his hands. Too        
     frantically-                                                          

     A piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground.          

     Immediately, he bends down to pick it up but-                         

     HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR REMAINS STANDING IN SILENCE,             
     WATCHING HIM.                                                         

     Looking up, the man realizes his reflection has become                
     independent. A separate being...                                      

     Terrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double.         

     The pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects      
     the neon lights just like a knife blade.                              

     His eyes turn cold with fear when-                                    

     HIS DOUBLE IN THE MIRROR STABS ITSELF DEEP IN ITS THROAT!             

     IN REALITY, THE MAN HAS NOT MOVED AN INCH, YET HIS THROAT RIPS        
     OPEN, RELEASING A RIVER OF BLOOD.                                     

     Void of any facial expression, the man's reflection slices his        
     jugular from end to end.                                              

     In reality, the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on        
     the mirror- TURNING THE IMAGE TO A DARK DEEP RED.

     OPENING CREDITS ON-                                                   

     All the reflections catch in the glass buildings of Manhattan-        

     The traffic in the streets, the old turn-of-the-century façades,      
     the people walking on the sidewalk, the pigeons flying away, the      
     Brooklyn Bridge and the Manhattan skyline reflecting off the
     surface of the Hudson River...

     Seen through the mirrored surfaces, everything in the city seems      
     to move in a distorted way. Ominous.                                  

     The softness of the sun's rising light is contrasted with the         
     eerie, haunting music.

2    INT. DAY - APARTMENT QUEENS                                       2   

                               "A WEEK BEFORE"                             

     Bip. Bip. Bip...

     It's 8 a.m. The blinking digital numbers of the alarm clock
     reflect off the wooden floor of the apartment.                        

     The sunlight is diffused through the drawn curtains of the            
     living room.                                                          

     Seen in the reflection of the TV-set, a man is sleeping on the        
     couch. He switches off the alarm and rises to go into the             
     bathroom.                                                             


3    BATHROOM - CONTINUITY                                             3

     Like a thick fog, the steam from the shower fills the bathroom.
     The shower turns off. A hand reaches out to wipe away the mist        
     on the mirror above the sink, revealing-                              

     The face of BEN CARSON, 41 years old. His eyes reflect the            
     hardships of life. A life, that from the lines on his face, we        
     suspect hasn't been easy. On his chest and shoulder, SEVERAL          
     BULLET SCARS.                                                         

     Ben changes his razor blade and starts to shave his 3 day old
     stubble.


4    BEDROOM - CONTINUITY                                              4

     Ben finishes getting dressed and walks to the half opened             
     bedroom door.                                                         

     Inside, ANGELA is asleep in the bed. She is younger than Ben.         

     ANGELA awakens slowly-                                                

                              ANGELA
                  What time is it?

                              BEN
                  Almost 8:30... Coffee?

                              ANGELA
                  No, you're going to be late.

                              BEN
                  Go back to sleep... I'll call you, OK?

                              ANGELA
                  Yeah, I won't be working until later                    
                  tonight.

     He comes to kiss her on the forehead. She opens a sleepy eye and     
     smiles.

                                ANGELA (CONT'D)                           
                  You shaved?                                             

     She strokes his face gently.                                         

                              ANGELA (CONT'D)
                  I like it. It makes you look younger.                   

     Ben slips on his old military parka before leaving.                  

                                ANGELA (CONT'D)                           
                  Good luck!                                              

                              BEN
                  See you later, Angie.                                   


5    INT. DAY - HALLWAY BUILDING                                     5

     Ben walks down the hallway. The building is old and clearly not      
     well maintained, cracks and graffiti cover the walls.

     The downtown streets are clogged with the early morning rush         
     hour traffic.

     On the honorary board of the NYPD we can read the names of all       
     the officers decorated for their courage. In the reflection of

                             BEN                                       
                 No, I'm staying at my sister's, in                    
                 Queens.                                               

                             LARRY                                     
                 I didn't know you had a sister. What                  
                 does she do?                                          

                             BEN                                       
                 She's a bartender.                                    

                             LARRY                                     
                 That's not too good for you! Anyway,                  
                 you know you are always welcome to                    
                 stay at our house.                                    

    Larry looks up at Ben, slightly uneasy-

                 I ran into Amy the other day. How are                  
                 things going between the two of you?                   

    Ben remains silent. He obviously doesn't want to get into that      
    subject.                                                            

                             LARRY (CONT'D)                             
                 So, why did you want to see me Ben?                    

                             BEN                                        
                 You know what I want. I'm ready to                     
                 come back, I'm feeling much better                     
                 now.                                                   

                             LARRY                                      
                 Listen Ben, I can't bring you back on                  
                 the force. Nobody in the squad wants                   
                 you around right now. I'm sorry but I                  
                 have to be honest with you. You                        
                 understand, right?                                     

                             BEN                                        
                 Larry, I'm telling you, I'm ready.                     

                             LARRY                                      
                 If it was up to me, I would bring you                  
                 back tomorrow, but I'm not the only                    
                 one who decides. Listen, I think I've                  
                 got something else for you. I know a                   
                 guy at the Mayflower corporation and                   
                 they need someone to watch over one of                 
                 their department stores.                               

                             BEN                                        
                 What?! Come on Larry, a security guard                 
                 job... I'm not ready to retire yet!                    

                             LARRY                                      
                 Hey! I'm just trying to help here. I                   
                 know you're over qualified for that                    
                 position but it's a good opportunity                   
                 for you for the time being...until the                 
                 situation here quiets down. Also the                   
                 money is not that bad.                                 

    Ben is having a hard time to contain his anger.                     

                             LARRY (CONT'D)                             
                 You need the money, Ben. You're in the                 
                 middle of a divorce and you've got                     
                 child support to cover. If you want to                 
                 see your kids, you've got to get a                     
                 job, any job.                                          

    Deep inside, Ben knows Larry's right.

                Yeah, in a couple months... I gave                       
                everything for the NYPD. I almost died                   
                out there. Everyone seems to have

10   INT. DAY- CORONER'S OFFICE                                     10

     We discover a whole different world-

     In the sterile environment of the NYC Chief Medical Examiner's      
     Office, forensic scientists with tape recorders in hand,            
     describe the corpses.                                               

     We are a world away from the Hollywood clichés of neatly laid
     out, immaculate cadavers. Here, some of the corpses have reached
     a state of advanced decomposition and others are still frozen in
     contorted positions, expressing their ultimate agony before
     dying. From the homeless man fished out of the river, to the
     woman killed by gun shots, each corpse tells his own story...

     Amidst the group of doctors 35-year-old AMY, deeply immersed in
     an autopsy, is interrupted by her cell phone.                       

     Amy checks the display for the incoming call- BEN. She hesitates
     for a moment and doesn't answer the call.                           

     Amy goes back to the postmortem analysis on her tape recorder.

                                AMY (O.S.)
                  " ...You have reached Amy Carson. I am                 
                  not available to take your call.
                  Please leave a message and I will get
                  back to you as soon as I can."

     Caught in the pouring rain, Ben has taken shelter under the
     scaffolding at a street corner. He plugs his ear with his finger
     to block the traffic and city commotion -

                                BEN
                        (on Amy's voicemail)
                  Amy, it's me... I just wanted to let you
                  know that I got a job today... It's                    
                  nothing special, just a security guard                 
                  job... If you still want to go ahead                   
                  with it, we can sign the divorce
                  papers... I mean, if that's what you
                  really want.                                           
                        (he hesitates)
                  I've been thinking about Michael's                     
                  birthday tomorrow. It would be nice if                 
                  we could celebrate it together ... You
                  know, for the kids' sake... Call me...                 
                  Please.                                                

     Ben hangs up the phone. He lingers under the scaffolding for a
     moment, watching the falling rain.


12   EXT. DAY - NEW YORK                                            12   

     The glass skyscrapers mirror the black clouds in the sky above
     as they slowly break up, giving way to the sun.                     


13   EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE                          13

     On 38th Street, just off of Broadway, the Mayflower has
     withstood the passage of time and the huge fire that forced it
     to shut down-

     The damage from the fire is still noticeable on the facade of
     the building-

     The fire appears to have started on the ground floor and seems
     to have spread all the way up to the top. Some of the windows
     are shattered, while others are boarded up. What was once an
     impressive ornate building, a fine example of 1920's
     architecture standing on one of Manhattan's most dynamic
     streets, now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation.

     What is left of it is a mere ruin, a sort of neglected ghost
     ship, abandoned in the heart of the city.

                                                              9.




14   INT. DAY - MAYFLOWER                                          14

     The last beams of daylight shine through the broken windowpanes.

     Inside the department store, everything has remained the same
     since the fire, as if time stood still. The display cases, the
     departments, the mannequins, and even the clothes are all burnt
     or blackened by the fire. A thick coat of soot covers the floor
     and rainwater drips down all over the place.

                            MAN (O.S.)                                  
                It's been five years and they're still                  
                in a legal battle with the insurance                    
                companies. Even cleaning up that mess                   
                is impossible...                                        

     In his dark brown uniform, the daytime security guard, LORENZO     
     SAPELLI, 60's, seems pleased to guide Ben through what was once
     a temple of beauty and vanity.

                            LORENZO                                     
                You know, the Meredith family acquired                  
                this building after St. John's                          
                Hospital closed in 1952. It was the                     
                very first Mayflower to open on the                     
                East Coast.                                             

     On the cracked walls, THE HUGE 1920 MIRRORS that have survived     
     the flames reflect merely the remnants of the past. The
     customers are long gone and have been replaced by pigeons flying
     in and out of the gaps in the roof.

                            LORENZO (CONT'D)                            
                The company wants us to patrol the                      
                premises every couple of hours, but I
                do my rounds every three hours and
                that's more than enough. Anyway,
                you'll see, there's not much going on.
                It's pretty calm around here.

     Ben follows Lorenzo through the burnt display counters. He         
     listens but his mind has drifted elsewhere. This place makes him
     uncomfortable. It's not only the lingering smell of a fire, but
     also a sense of death that hangs over it.                          

     The whistling of the wind through the store's old ventilation      
     system sounds like faraway voices.                                 

     Ben and Lorenzo appear at the top of the staircase of the 2nd
     floor.

                              LORENZO (CONT'D)

     Ben observes the surroundings- Yet another spectacle of
     devastation.

                                LORENZO (CONT'D)
                  Thank God you didn't show up any
                  later. This place gives me the chills
                  at night. ... No electricity, and all
                  these mirrors... You know, I live in                    
                  Brooklyn near a Jewish neighborhood,                    
                  and when someone dies, they cover all                   
                  the mirrors in their house. Some say
                  that it's just to renounce all vanity
                  during the mourning period, but others
                  say something else... They say it's to
                  keep the soul of the dead from being
                  trapped in the mirrors... Believe it                    
                  or not, there's always a bit of truth
                  in any superstition. Am I right?                        

     Amused and skeptical at the same time, Ben contemplates the          
     mirrors that surround him-

                              LORENZO (CONT'D)                            
                  I guess you just have to keep your
                  eyes away from them.

     Unlike the rest of the scenery, THE MIRRORS ARE PERFECTLY CLEAN
     AND GLISTENING.

                              BEN
                  Did you clean them?

                             LORENZO
                  What?

                              BEN
                  The mirrors, why are they so clean?                     

     Lorenzo smiles-

                              LORENZO
                  That's Gary Lewis, the fellow who                       
                  worked here before you. He was
                  completely obsessed with these damn
                  mirrors. He'd spend the entire night
                  polishing them.

                              BEN
                  Why did he leave?

                              LORENZO
                  No idea. Just didn't show up one
                  night. I take it he's found a better                    
                  opportunity somewhere else.

                I'm not one to complain, but I never
                really liked him much... Could never be
                bothered to say hello or at least ask
                "how are you doing?"... I mean, damn, do
                we work together as a team or what?!
                You, on the other hand, seem like a

                Why did you resign from the force? You                   
                were a detective, is that correct?

     Ben and Lorenzo reach the next floor.

                blows, sometimes the tiles fly off the
                roof and they'll just snap your ear
                off, if you follow what I'm saying...

     Lorenzo checks the time on his watch.

                            LORENZO (CONT'D)
                Well, I'll let you get acquainted with
                the rest of the store on your own.

     They turn around.

                            LORENZO (CONT'D)
                Follow me, I'll show you our

                these uniforms.


15   EXT. DUSK - MAYFLOWER - SECURITY GUARD TRAILER                15

     It's almost night. Ben and Lorenzo have finished their visit and
     exit the department store.

                We were a pretty big team working here                   
                before the fire. When you stop to

                stores in New York, this one was the

     Outside the building behind the fence blocking its entry, a
     construction trailer has been outfitted for the guards.

                               LORENZO (CONT'D)                             
                   Here you go. This is where you'll be
                   spending most of your time. At least
                   you've got electricity in here. It's
                   nice and warm, and there's even a TV.


16   INT. NIGHT - SECURITY GUARD TRAILER                              16

     Cartoons flicker on an old television set. All bundled up in a
     coat, and wearing a woolen hat, a young boy is watching TV.
     Lorenzo and Ben enter the mobile home-

                               LORENZO
                   Lorenzo Junior, my grandson... Say hello
                   Lorenzo.

                               LORENZO JR.
                   Hello.

                               LORENZO
                   Lorenzo and I are going to the movies
                   tonight...                                               

     Lorenzo strokes his grandson on the head and proceeds to the
     back of the mobile home, leaving Ben alone with the child. The
     boy looks almost hypnotized by the images on TV.

                               BEN
                   How old are you, Lorenzo?

                               LORENZO JR.
                   8.

     Lorenzo Jr. shifts his attention from the cartoons and stares
     Ben in the face-

                               LORENZO JR. (CONT'D)
                   Do you work in the department store?

                   I do now.

                                 LORENZO JR.
                   Grandpa says there are ghosts in the
                   store... Is that true?

     Ben smiles.

                               BEN
                   I think your grandpa just wants to
                   scare you a little.

     Lorenzo Senior has changed clothes, and returns with a uniform,
     which he hands over to Ben-

                                LORENZO
                  Here, this should fit you. Lorenzo,
                  put your coat on... We are already late.                  
                      (to Ben, on the sly)
                  There's a drop of Jack Daniel's in the                    
                  cupboard... To keep yourself warm.

     Lorenzo hands over the keys-

                              LORENZO (CONT'D)
                  Well, Ben, the place is all yours.

     He's about to leave when-

                                LORENZO (CONT'D)
                  Oh! I forgot the most important                           
                  thing... the flashlights! You'll be                       
                  needing one of these at night. We've
                  got two of them. They run on
                  batteries. Don't forget to charge
                  them... See you in the morning, Ben.

                              BEN
                  See you tomorrow.                                         

     Lorenzo and Lorenzo Jr. exit the trailer. Through the window,
     Ben sees them walk out to the street.

     Ben inspects the trailer- scattered with knickknacks, the
     decoration of the place corresponds well with Lorenzo's
     personality - warmhearted and humble.

     The clock on the wall shows 7 p.m.... A long night lies ahead.

     Ben grabs a flashlight and turns it on. The beam of light is
     dazzling-

                                                             CUT TO:


17   INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER - A FEW HOURS LATER                        17

     The flashlight sweeps across the dark entrance hall.

     Wearing the security guard's uniform marked with an embroidered
     "M", Ben makes his first round of the store.

     The pigeons perched on the roof seem to observe him.

     Ben proceeds slowly up the stairs.

                                                                14.




18    - SECOND FLOOR -                                                18

      In the Men's department, Ben's flashlight is a mere luminous
      spot twirling in the night.

      The ever-present mirrors magnify the space to infinity.


19    - THIRD FLOOR -                                                 19

      Ben walks through the different sections of the Ladies'
      department. He examines the remains of the charred garments
      sagging on the hangers.

      The silhouettes of the burnt mannequins emerge in the gloom of
      the night.

      STRANGE AND DISTURBING SHAPES REFLECT OFF THE MIRRORS.

      Wide exterior shot-                                                   

      By night, the department store's ornate facade takes on an            
      entirely different appearance - more menacing, almost evil.           


19B   INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER                                          19B   

      Ben continues his rounds.                                             

      We follow his path through reflections in the mirrors-                

      AS IF HE WAS BEING WATCHED...                                         

      Then-                                                                 

      For the first time, we discover another perspective, another POV      
      FROM WITHIN THE MIRRORS. It feels ominous, slightly detached.         
      The sound is muted.                                                   

      Ben crosses back the third floor-                                     

      The second floor...                                                   


20    OMITTED                                                         20

22    OMITTED                                                         22    

                                                                15.




23   - ENTRANCE HALL GROUND FLOOR -                                   23   

     In the reflection of one of the grand mirrors in the entrance
     hall, we see Ben come down the stairs. He stops for a moment,
     facing his reflection in the mirror.

     He fixes his collar and looks at himself in his new clothes- Not
     quite an NYPD uniform...

     Suddenly, his eyes freeze. Intrigued, he comes closer to the
     mirror and leans forward-

     A HANDPRINT, BARELY VISIBLE, ON THE ICE COLD SURFACE.

     He touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it
     off, unsuccessfully. He picks up a rag from the ground, spits on
     the mirror, and rubs the mark fervently. The print remains. This
     confirms his hunch-

     THE HANDPRINT IS INSIDE THE MIRROR...

     By angling the flashlight, another handprint is revealed.

     Another. And yet another-

     THE ENTIRE MIRROR IS COVERED WITH HANDPRINTS, JUST AS IF A CROWD
     OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE HAD PRESSED ITSELF AGAINST THE GLASS
     TO GET OUT...                                                         

     As he looks back up in the mirror he sees- THE ACCESS DOOR TO         
     THE BASEMENT OPENING...                                               

     Ben turns around. His gaze freezes- THE ACCESS DOOR TO THE            
     BASEMENT IS CLOSED!                                                   

     YET, IN THE MIRROR, IT CONTINUES TO SLOWLY SCREECH OPEN!              

     Ben swings his head back and forth, between the shut door in          
     reality and the opened door in the mirror. What is happening? Is      
     he dreaming or hallucinating?                                         

     Ben walks backwards towards the basement door, keeping his eyes       
     fixed on the mirror. As he goes to reach for the handle, he sees      
     his reflection reaching for the handle of an invisible door!          

     Ben opens it-                                                         

     THE SYNCHRONICITY BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND THE ONE REFLECTED        
     IN THE MIRROR HAS BEEN RESTORED. Ben tries to reenact the             
     phenomenon. He opens and closes the door over and over, while         
     observing his reflection, but the mirror is no longer deceitful.      

     The staircase leading to the basement vanishes into the dark.         
     Ben hesitates.                                                        

                                                                16.

36    INT. NIGHT - BASEMENT CORRIDOR MAYFLOWER - CONTINUITY           36    

      Ben walks down the stairs, step-by-step, lighting his way with a
      flashlight. The beam of light dims, the battery is almost dead.
      He gives it a few taps to make the light reappear.

      Last step-

      HIS FOOT LANDS IN WATER!

                             BEN
                   Fuck...                                                  

      A few inches of water cover the basement floor. One of the water
      pipes must have burst due to the cold.

     The light flickers back for a moment, revealing before him-        the
     narrow subterranean corridors of the department store.                   

     Along a wall, Ben finds a fuse box and pushes some of the                
     switches. Further down in the corridor, a couple of fluorescent          
     lights flicker to life- two tiny sources deep inside the                 
     darkness.

     AS BEN DISCOVERS HIS SURROUNDINGS, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY,         
     UP ALONG THE STAIRS, THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR, IT ACCELERATES AND           
     STOPS IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR-

     IN THE REFLECTION, WE SEE THE BASEMENT DOOR SHUT...

37   EXT. DAY - NEW JERSEY STREET                                       37

     It's been snowing all day and a white coat of powder outlines
     the trees and houses.

     On the front lawn of their house, 5 year old MICHAEL and 7 year
     old DAISY are building a snowman.

                              MICHAEL
                  Why did they say on TV that it wasn't
                  supposed to snow today, but tomorrow
                  instead? Why did they lie?

                                DAISY
                  Sometimes they make mistakes, Michael.
                  It happens...

                              MICHAEL
                  Grown-ups don't make mistakes. Only
                  little children do.

     Slightly annoyed, the little boy places the eyes on the snowman.

     Daisy's face lights up with a big smile when she catches sight
     of her father's car approaching-                                         

                             DAISY
                  Daddy!

     Michael turns around and sees Ben exiting his 1986 Oldsmobile,           
     with a big wrapped package in his arms.

     The children abandon their snowman and rush towards their
     father. Ben takes Michael into his arms-

                              MICHAEL
                      (pointing to the wrapped
                       present)
                  What is that?

                              BEN
                  Well I don't know, I just found this
                  package hidden behind a tree.

                              MICHAEL
                  Is it for me?

                              BEN
                  Maybe...
                      (to his daughter)
                  Daisy, has Michael been a good boy?
                  Does he deserve his birthday present?

     Michael nods.

                              DAISY
                  No! Yesterday he finished the whole
                  bag of candy when mom had told him he
                  could only have one piece.

                                MICHAEL
                  Not true!

                              DAISY
                  Yes it's true!

                              MICHAEL
                  No, it's not true... She's lying Daddy.
                  I've been a very good boy, I promise.

     They enter the house.

                              BEN
                  Is mom back?

                              DAISY
                  Not yet. Rosa came to pick us up from
                  school today.                                           


38   INT. DAY - HOUSE - CONTINUITY                                  38

     In the kitchen, ROSA, the nanny, is rinsing the dishes from the      
     afternoon snack-

                                BEN
                  Hello Rosa!

                              ROSA
                  Hello Señor Carson. How are you?

                  OK, I'll wait for her.

                              ROSA
                  Do you want me to fix you a snack?

                              BEN
                  No, thank you. I'll be fine.

     Ben takes off his coat and joins the kids in the living room. He
     hands over the present to his son.

     Daisy is sitting in the armchair, holding her cat, TIGER, in her
     arms.

                              BEN (CONT'D)
                  Happy birthday, Michael.

                                MICHAEL
                  What is it?

                              DAISY
                  Duh, open it stupid!

     Michael tears away the wrapping paper and discovers a remote
     control car. The little boy is on cloud nine.


39   - LATER IN THE AFTERNOON -                                     39

     Through the front window, we see a Volvo station wagon park in
     front of the house. Amy gets out of the car, loaded with
     shopping bags. She enters the house and hands the groceries over
     to Rosa.

                                AMY
                  Hi Rosa... Where are the kids?                         

                              ROSA

                  ...With Señor Ben.                                     

     The expression on Amy's face shifts. Noticeably irritated, she      
     goes up to the second floor.                                        

     Michael's remote control car drives at full speed down the          
     hallway. Ben shows his children how to operate the remote           
     control while the bathtub fills up. He seems as excited as the      
     kids by the new toy.                                                

     Ben turns around to find Amy watching them.

                  Ben, can I talk to you, in private?

     Ben follows Amy into the bedroom. She closes the door behind        
     them.


40   INT. EARLY EVENING- BEDROOM HOUSE                              40

     Amy is not equally pleased to see him- She's beside herself with    
     anger-

                              AMY
                  What is this? I already asked you not
                  to drop by without calling, didn't I?

                              BEN
                  I do, but you never take my calls!

                  of the night. I'm better off without
                  them.

                  I don't want to know, Ben. I don't
                  want to hear about it. It's not my
                  problem. You're not my problem. You've                 
                  done more than enough harm already.

                  We are not talking about people, we're

                  you tell me you were gonna change and
                  nothing happened? It only got worse.

     Ben moves closer to his ex-wife-

                  Just give me another chance.                             

     She smiles- How many other chances did she already give him?          
     Behind the firmness and intransigence she conveys, we sense Amy       
     is torn. She still loves him as well.

                  never stop you from seeing your

     Out of nowhere, Ben hits the wall with his bare fist-

                  WHAT RULES?! IT'S MY SON'S FUCKING                       
                  BIRTHDAY TODAY! COME ON AMY, WHAT RULE                   
                  IS GOING TO STOP ME FROM SEEING HIM?                     


41   INT. EARLY EVENING - HOUSE BATHROOM                             41

     In the bathtub, Daisy and Michael cannot avoid overhearing their
     parents arguing. In denial, Michael blocks his ears with his          
     hands and lies back under the water...                                


42   BACK IN THE BEDROOM -                                           42    

     Amy seems distrustful of Ben, scared of how close he is to the        
     edge. We can see the anger in his eyes...                             

                              AMY                                          
                  Look at yourself. You're still                           
                  carrying around so much of that anger.                   

     He catches a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror- and of the      
     desperate violence in his eyes... Ben steps back.                     

                              BEN                                          
                      (trying to calm down)                                
                  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at                      
                  you... Things could be so different                      
                  between us.                                              

                              AMY                                          
                  Yes I know, but it's up to you Ben.                      


                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                             22.

                              BEN                                        
                  Yeah... Anyway, I wasn't planning on                   
                  staying. My shift starts in an hour.                   
                  I'll just kiss them goodbye and then                   
                  I'm leaving.                                           

     Ben exits the room. Amy is left alone-                              

     Through the window, she watches Ben exit the house and get into     
     his car.

     When she turns away, she discovers Michael and Daisy standing       
     outside the bathtub dripping wet in their towels. She smiles,       
     and quickly comes to dry them.                                      

                                MICHAEL                                  
                  Mom?

                                AMY
                  Yes, honey.

                              MICHAEL                                    
                  Is Daddy coming back to live with us?                  

     She smiles gently.                                                  

                              AMY
                  I don't know sweetheart. I don't know.                 


43   INT. DAY - BASEMENT CORRIDOR MAYFLOWER                        43    

     The beams from the flashlight are reflected in the few inches of
     water flooding the basement corridor. Since yesterday, the water    
     level has continued to rise.

     The outline of Ben and Lorenzo's silhouettes appear in the
     staircase leading to the ground floor-

                              BEN
                  I haven't managed to find the source
                  of the leak. My guess is it doesn't
                  come from the store... It must be a
                  municipal pipe that blew with the
                  cold...

                              LORENZO
                  I'll call the company tomorrow morning                 
                  and have them come take a look at it.


44   INT. NIGHT- SECURITY GUARD TRAILER                            44

     On the gas stove, a kettle is whistling.

     Ben rummages through the cupboards and the drawers. He finds
     some instant coffee next to the bottle of Jack Daniels. He
     briefly hesitates between the coffee and the whisky...              

     He grabs a cup and pours the boiling water into the instant
     coffee.                                                             

     In the reflection of the clock, we see Ben watching TV. It is
     past midnight. Ben gets up and grabs his flashlight- It's time      
     for his rounds.


45   INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER CENTRAL HALL                            45

     Through the shattered panes of the central dome, we see Ben
     walking through the store.

     Since the mysterious occurrences of the night before, his
     attitude has changed. He avoids, as much as possible, looking
     into the mirrors. He is on guard, fearing another supernatural
     manifestation.

     The shadows, the mannequins, and the shapes in the mirrors are
     all disturbing and unsettling.

     Even what remains of the sculptures on the top of the marble        
     columns seems alive in the dark.                                    

     As he crosses the entrance hall, a glint of light catches his
     attention. Despite himself, he stops and gazes into the mirror-

     AT THE FAR END OF THE STORE, ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS IS IN FULL
     SWING AND BATHED IN DAYLIGHT! EVERYTHING IS SPOTLESS, AS IF THE
     FIRE HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE. CUSTOMERS COME AND GO AS IF NOTHING
     HAPPENED.

     How is this possible? Ben turns around to see the same spot in
     the real world- ONLY IT'S IN RUINS...                               

     Ben glances back at the reflection in the mirror-

     The vision of the past prevails. Unable to ignore it, Ben
     decides to check it out for himself...

     Ben wanders off towards the far end of the store, a landscape of
     dust and desolation. HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR, ON THE OTHER
     HAND, HEADS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE "FLASHBACK"-

     We follow him in the mirror-

     Ben has left the night behind and enters the "daytime"
     department. Everything is in perfect order and unspoiled.

     Ben continues his journey into the past.




                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                                24.

     The customers jostle one another while shopping during a big
     sale. Children run wild in the aisles. Women fight over articles
     of clothing.                                                          

     Ben stops dead in his tracks when he notices, around his shoes,
     a transparent liquid spilling out on the floor-

     He bends down and dips his fingertips into the liquid- GASOLINE.
     Gallons of flowing gasoline gradually spreading over the floor
     of the department store.

     Ben turns around and sees, under the shelving, A HAND LIGHTING A
     ZIPPO-

     The lighter falls to the floor in slow motion.

     The liquid bursts into flame instantly. THE CHEERFUL VISION OF A
     DAY IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE QUICKLY TURNS INTO A NIGHTMARE-

     EVERYTHING IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES. THE CLOTHES, THE MANNEQUINS
     AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, THE CROWD! THE AGONIZING SHRIEKS OF PAIN
     AND PANIC ARE DEAFENING.

     Frightened, Ben steps back-

     The flames spread quickly to the escalators where the crowd has       
     rushed to escape death-                                               

     HORRIFIC VISIONS OF PEOPLE BURNING ALIVE... INCINERATED FLESH.
     FACES DISTORTED BY THE PAIN, SKIN MELTING TO THE BONE.                

     In the midst of the flames through the heat waves, Ben spots the      
     face of the firestarter- IS IT HIS OWN?                               

     Ben has no time to react. In a split second, his uniform catches
     fire.

     Panicked, he attempts to put out the fire with his hands-

                                                            CUT TO:

     IN THE DARK NIGHT SURROUNDED BY THE CHARRED RUINS, BEN QUIVERS
     DELIRIOUSLY AS HE TRIES TO SMOTHER THE INVISIBLE FLAMES.

     He comes back to reality-

     Ben catches his breath, trying to come to his senses. What's
     happening to him? What he just experienced certainly felt real.

     During his panic, the flashlight rolled under one of the
     counters.

     Ben bends down to pick it up. The beam illuminates the ground
     and throws light on an object a bit further away- A LEATHER
     WALLET.



                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                                 25.

      He stretches out his hand to pick it up. The leather is worn-out
      but the absence of dust establishes that the wallet has landed
      there recently. Ben examines the object with the experienced
      touch of a professional accustomed to handling evidence.

      Between the collection of cards and scraps of paper, Ben finds a
      driver's license belonging to- GARY LEWIS, 55 years old, a
      sturdily built African American man. WE RECOGNIZE THE MAN              
      RUNNING IN THE SUBWAY, AT THE BEGINNING. The name rings a bell         
      for him-                                                               


46    INT. NIGHT - SECURITY GUARD TRAILER                              46

      Ben returns to the trailer and rummages through the closet-

      He stops when he finds another uniform. A name is embroidered on
      the shoulder-

      AGAIN THE SAME NAME: GARY LEWIS, BEN'S PREDECESSOR, THE MISSING
      NIGHT WATCHMAN.

      The wallet rests on the table and piques Ben's curiosity. He
      cannot hold back his police instincts.

      He finally empties out the contents on the table-

      A Blockbuster card, restaurant receipts, a driver's license,
      Phillips' business card from Mayflower, cash and a sheet of
      paper folded in four-

      Ben unfolds the sheet of paper and sees, written in ink-

      ESSEKER                                                                

      Ben chews over these seven letters. Is it somebody's name? A           
      place? A code? Initials? He folds it up again and puts                 
      everything back, neatly, in the wallet that he stows away in one       
      of the drawers.                                                        

                                                     FADE TO BLACK

48A   EXT. DAY - QUEENS STREET                                         48A

      A busy street under the subway overpass. We see a neighborhood         
      bar on the corner-


49    INT. DAY -QUEENS BAR                                             49

      At this time of day the place is deserted. A plasma screen shows       
      a baseball game. A drunk guy is half asleep at the corner table.

     Sitting at the bar, Ben is nervous, tense... He removes the         
     steeped tea bag from his cup.                                       

     Ben stares at himself in the mirror, behind the bottle display
     shelves. It is not his mirror image that he is observing. His
     gaze seems to pierce through his own reflection, to dive beyond,
     into the very depths of his soul.                                   

     Angela interrupts, across from him, behind the bar. She works
     here.

                  Come on, you've been looking at                        
                  yourself for more than half an hour.                   
                  You never used to be so vain.                          

                                BEN
                  You can't avoid them. They're
                  everywhere...

                              ANGELA
                  What are you talking about?

                              BEN
                  The mirrors... In the department

                  windows of every fucking building in                   
                  this city. I feel like I'm not the one                 
                  looking into the mirrors, but rather                   
                  they're looking at me.                                 

     Angela smiles, not sure if he is serious-                           

                              ANGELA

     Ben observes the palm of his hand.

     Angela smiles at him and continues to polish the drinking           
     glasses.                                                            


50   INT. NIGHT - BASEMENT MAYFLOWER                               50    

     In the darkness, a rat glides peacefully on the water surface.

     In the basement, the water level continues to rise.

     With a flashlight in hand, and his feet submerged in the water,
     Ben moves deeper into the tunnel.

     He is searching for the source of the leak. The beam of light
     sweeps across the walls and the piping.

     Ben crosses an intersection. In the corner, on the tiled wall,
     he barely discerns an old inscription ingrained with decades of
     dust and dirt. He sinks his hand into the water and wipes it
     off, revealing an arrow pointing to, ST JOHN'S DEPARTMENT OF        
     PSYCHIATRY.                                                         

     He continues his exploration of the subterranean passageways.

     Suddenly, he notices a darker area on the wall. He comes closer
     and discovers a brownish damp-spot, covered with mold. The
     humidity has pearled into droplets.

     He has found the source of the leak.

     His hand brushes the wall, causing it to crumble instantly. Ben
     digs into the plaster as if it were butter, bringing a cracked
     water pipe to light. The leakage has damaged the wall in which
     the tubing was embedded.

     Ben hears the echoing sound of streaming water, as if there were
     another room on the other side of the wall.

     He pushes against the saturated wall, and pierces through it
     with his arm. He removes his arm. For a moment, he observes the
     gaping black hole that he has just left behind.

     Ben peeks through the hole with his flashlight, but he cannot
     make out what is on the other side.

     He makes the hole bigger, until the passage is large enough for
     him to crawl through-

     ON THE OTHER SIDE, HE DISCOVERS A LARGE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE       
     MIDDLE OF IT ANOTHER ROOM- AN OCTAGONAL ONE WHOSE EACH AND EVERY    
     WALL, INCLUDING THE CEILING, IS MADE OF GIGANTIC TWO WAYS           
     MIRRORS.

     One of the mirrors is opened, ajar- It's a door.                    

     He enters.

     His image is reflected in all directions and from infinite
     angles. Ben moves towards the center of the room-

     ALTHOUGH THE ROOM SEEMED EMPTY BEFORE, SOMEBODY IS NOW STANDING        
     IN THE CORNER.                                                         

     It's a well-built man. He too is wearing the blue security
     guard's uniform.

     From where he stands, Ben can only see the back of the man's
     head. As he moves in closer, he can make out the name
     embroidered on the man's shoulder-

     IT'S GARY LEWIS, THE FORMER NIGHT WATCHMAN!

                               BEN
                  Gary?

     The silhouette remains still.

                               BEN (CONT'D)
                  Gary?

     Ben comes a bit closer.

     His gaze freezes when he realizes that Gary is not standing in
     front of the mirror with his face pressed against it, but-

     HE IS BEHIND THE MIRROR, INSIDE!

     Ben steps back, terrified.

     He doesn't know how to interpret this new phenomenon.

     Ben gathers his courage and returns in front of the mirror-

     Knock, knock, knock...

     He hits the mirror with his fist, as if it were merely a glass
     window behind which Gary Lewis was standing, on the other side-

     No reaction. Ben strikes the mirror harder.

     Knock, knock, knock...

     The former night watchman turns around slowly towards Ben,
     revealing his face little by little...

                                                             CUT TO:

     In his bed, Ben wakes up with a jolt- THE ENCOUNTER WITH GARY
     WAS A DREAM.

     Knock, knock, knock...

     Somebody is knocking at his door. Ben gets up from the couch-       

                              BEN
                  Coming...

     Ben opens the door to a UPS deliveryman holding out a package-

                              DELIVERYMAN
                  Mr. Carson?                                            
                      (Ben nods)
                  Would you mind signing here, please?

     Ben signs for it and takes the package.

                              DELIVERYMAN (CONT'D)
                  You have a nice day, Sir...

     Ben shuts the door and examines the UPS box. He's not used to
     getting many deliveries. He flips it over to see who it is from-

     THE SENDER IS GARY LEWIS...

     Ben grabs a kitchen knife to open the parcel. He tears away the
     cardboard and empties out the contents onto the living room
     table-

     A DOZEN NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS LAND, ALL MIXED UP, ON THE TABLE.

     More or less recent, all the articles relate to the department
     store and the fire that burned it down... Gary has meticulously
     cut them out and sent them to Ben. But why?                         


52   EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER                                           52

     Ben's car parks in front of the fence that encloses the entrance
     to Mayflower.

     He runs into Lorenzo who exits the trailer, ready to go home
     from work-

                                LORENZO
                  I've just been through the craziest
                  day here... No kidding! Your ex-
                  colleagues came to pay us a visit...

                              BEN
                  What happened?

                  never liked him too much, but poor
                  guy, he didn't deserve to go like

                  No... they wouldn't tell me.

     Lorenzo hands him over the keys.

                  Well, Ben? I better get going, Mrs.
                  Sapelli is waiting for me at home.
                  Have a good night at work, Ben. Oh,                      
                  and by the way, about that leak,
                  they're sending someone over to work
                  at it the beginning of next week.

                              BEN
                  Have a good night, Lorenzo.

     Ben remains standing on the landing of the trailer for a moment,
     his gaze fixed at the department store-

     THE WALLET, THE DREAM, AND NOW, ON TOP OF EVERYTHING, THE NEWS
     OF GARY'S DEATH... ALL THESE STRANGE COINCIDENCES AROUND HIS
     PREDECESSOR HAVE AWOKEN HIS CURIOSITY AND DOUBT. BEN WANTS TO
     KNOW...

     IN FAST MOTION- FROM THE FINAL HOUR OF DAY TO THE FALL OF NIGHT.
     IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRRORS, LIGHT GIVES WAY TO THE
     DARKNESS...

     The beam from the flashlight appears in the distance-

     Determined, Ben crosses the entrance hall in the direction of
     the basement door.

     He goes down-


54   INT. NIGHT - BASEMENT MAYFLOWER                                 54

     Ben appears at the bottom of the stairs with his flashlight, and
     follows the subterranean passageway.

     Suddenly he is struck by a frightening feeling of déjà-vu, HE IS
     IN THE VERY ACT OF RELIVING HIS NIGHTMARE IN DETAIL, STEP BY
     STEP-

     In the darkness, the rat glides peacefully on the water surface.

     He crosses an intersection and, once again-

     He recognizes the half-visible Psychiatric Department sign on         
     the tiled wall.

     The beam from his flashlight sweeps across the walls and the
     piping, bringing to light, in the distance-

     THE BROWNISH DAMP-SPOT.

                                BEN
                      (to himself)
                  Damn... What is happening to me?

     The moisture has pearled into droplets. Slowly, his hand comes
     closer. The wall crumbles at the slightest touch...

     Pushed by curiosity, Ben begins to dig a hole in the plaster,
     just as he had done in his nightmare...

     He hears the echoing sound of streaming water, coming from the
     other side of the wall. It confirms the existence of a hidden
     room.

     Ben begins to dig frenetically in the saturated wall, creating a
     large enough opening to access the other side-

     He inspects the interior with his flashlight, revealing-

     THE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE MIDDLE THE OCTAGONAL ROOM, SURROUNDED       
     BY THE MIRRORING WALLS.

     He enters. His image is reflected in all directions and
     multiplied into infinity. His dream was foreboding. Everything        
     is perfectly identical to the nightmare, with the exception of
     Gary Lewis-

     The former watchman is not there but...                               

     ALL OF A SUDDEN, BEHIND HIM, ONE OF BEN'S DUPLICATES IN THE           
     INFINITE REFLECTION TURNS AROUND TO OBSERVE HIM WITH AN ICE COLD      
     GLARE...                                                              

     Sensing something wrong, Ben turns around.                            

     In the silence he faces his infinite reflections, all of them         
     identical- OR ALMOST...                                               

     Taking a closer look Ben notices one of the duplicates' faces         
     bearing an expression slightly different from the others'. A          
     SUBTLE GRIN.

      Knowing that it has been noticed by Ben, the "rebel duplicate"      
      turns his face towards Ben, eyeing him with an evil gaze-           

      We can hardly recognize Ben's image.                                

      The duplicate takes a step forward from the line of the other       
      reflections and slowly walks towards Ben.                           

      Instinctively, Ben closes his eyes in an attempt to make the        
      vision disappear.                                                   

      When he opens up his eyes again-                                    

      HIS EVIL DOUBLE RUSHES TOWARDS HIM-                                 

      Ben steps back terrified.

      Under the dazzling neon light of the NYPD coroner's premises,
      Amy is in full swing submitting her conclusions on a homicide to
      the police inspectors in charge of the investigation.

      She is interrupted by somebody who enters the room- There is
      someone for her at the reception, who insists on seeing her
      urgently. Amy excuses herself, removes her examination gloves,      
      and exits the autopsy room.

      We follow her down the corridors as she passes men in police
      uniforms and doctors in white coats, in the endless comings and
      goings between the police station and the hospital.                 

      The atmosphere here is highly charged, reflecting the excessive

                   You are no longer a cop, Ben. This
                   isn't your business anymore.

                                 BEN

                   tell me something... I don't know him.

      aligned along the basement walls.

      A young doctor escorts Ben and Amy down the corridors of the
      morgue. As he is walking, the doctor flips through the register,
      in search of a name.

                                YOUNG DOCTOR
                  Gary Lewis... Gary Lewis... Oh, there he
                  is, 58B... He slashed his throat...                      

                              AMY
                      (to Ben)
                  There you go... There's your answer.
                  Your man committed suicide.

                              BEN                                          
                  You know a lot of people who cut their
                  own throats?                                             

                              YOUNG DOCTOR
                      (interrupting)                                       
                  Well, all I know is that the cops are                    
                  still investigating this one. That's                     
                  why we still have the body. People can                   
                  be very creative when it comes to                        
                  suicide. I'm sure it's not the                           
                  craziest thing you've seen.                              

     The young doctor stops in front of the number 58B. He opens the
     door to the refrigerated compartment bay and pulls out the tray
     carrying the corpse, wrapped in a white sheet-

                                  YOUNG DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                  Gary Lewis...

     He lifts the sheet, revealing Gary Lewis' upper body-

     Gary's eyes are rolled upwards and his throat is wide open. His       
     skin has become translucent, almost purple. His contorted corpse
     is frozen in a deadly expression of profound suffering... His         
     flesh has started to decompose and putrefy.

     Ben stares at the body, in search of a hint, a clue, any useful
     information...

     Amy becomes impatient.

                              AMY
                  I've got to get back to work, Ben.
                  They're waiting for me upstairs.

                                BEN
                  How... What did he slit his throat with?                 

     The doctor checks the report.

                                YOUNG DOCTOR
                  With... with a piece of mirror.

     Ben looks up.

56   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 56


                              YOUNG DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                ...He must have smashed it into pieces
                to have something to slash it with...                    

     The doctor, has a smirk on his face-

                              YOUNG DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                ...Seven years of bad luck.

     Suddenly, reflected in the stainless-steel door of the
     compartment bay, Ben sees-

     GARY'S FACE TURN SLOWLY TOWARDS HIM. GARY STARES DIRECTLY AT
     HIM. WITH A VOICE FROM BEYOND, HE DELIVERS A MESSAGE TO BEN-

                                GARY
                ...ESSSEKERRR...

     Ben jumps out of his skin and backs away, terrified. Neither Amy
     nor the doctor saw anything, of course. They gaze at him with a
     puzzled look-

                            AMY
                Are you OK, Ben? What's going on?

     Ben looks at the corpse and its reflection again- Gary is frozen
     in the same contorted position, as if nothing ever happened.

                            BEN
                    (coming to his senses)
                I need to see his files...

                              AMY
                What?

     Ben raises his voice.

                            BEN
                I NEED TO SEE HIS FILES!

                              AMY
                Come on, Ben, what is it you're after?
                I am not supposed to show you any
                file... You're not even allowed to be
                here. I could get fired for this.                        

     The doctor senses that the conversation is taking on a more
     personal turn.

                            YOUNG DOCTOR
                Well, I'll be off. Amy, you know where
                to find me if you need me.

     Amy is left alone with Ben.

                            AMY
                What is happening to you? What is all
                this supposed to mean? What is going
                on, Ben?

                            BEN
                I won't leave until I see that file.

                                                          CUT TO:


57   INT. DAY -AMY'S OFFICE                                         57

     On the shelves, photographs of Michael and Daisy stand next to
     the medical records and legal-medicine textbooks.

     Sitting behind Amy's desk, Ben is studying Gary Lewis' file. He
     flips back and forth through the different documents,
     photographs, and police reports.

     Amy observes him, perplexed. We sense that she is concerned         
     about Ben's strange behavior and over sensitivity.                  

                            BEN
                Look at this picture... Come and see,
                Amy.

     He shows her a snapshot taken by the police. We see Gary soaked
     in his own blood, the throat slit open. The picture is real,        
     crude. He lies outstretched, facing a mirror shattered into         
     several pointy pieces, like a spider web. In his hand, Gary
     still holds the piece of glass that he used to cut himself.         

                              BEN (CONT'D)
                Look...

                              AMY
                What!?

     Ben points to the reflection in the mirror-

                            BEN
                Look at the piece of mirror in his
                hand. In the reflection of the mirror                    
                it's covered in blood, and look- in                      
                reality, it's clean. Not a drop of
                blood...

                              AMY
                So what?

                            BEN
                Don't you find it strange that this                      
                mirror doesn't reflect an exact image
                of reality?

                              AMY
                  I can't see the difference. It must be
                  an effect of the angle from which the
                  photograph was taken. What is it you
                  are you trying to prove?

                              BEN
                  What if the mirrors were showing us
                  something different?

                              AMY
                  What? For Christ's sake, listen to
                  yourself, Ben! What are you talking
                  about?

                              BEN
                  What if the mirrors were reflecting
                  something that goes beyond reality?

                                AMY
                        (irritated)
                  OK... This is way over my head. I don't
                  have time for your barfly theories.                      

     Ben realizes that he will not succeed in convincing her. Not
     today.

                              BEN
                  Thanks for your help...

     He's on his way out, when she holds him back-

                              AMY
                  You should go home and get some rest.                    
                  This guy probably just killed himself
                  because he couldn't live with himself                    
                  anymore. It happens to thousands of                      
                  people, you know...                                      

                                                            CUT TO:        


58   INT. DAY - APARTMENT QUEENS - BATHROOM                           58   

     The steam has fogged up the mirror of the medicine cabinet.           

     Ben grabs a towel and steps out of the shower.

     He watches his blurry reflection. With his finger, on the
     surface of the fogged mirror, he writes-

     ESSEKER

     He contemplates the dripping letters for a long moment, trying
     to interpret their meaning.

     In the end, he wipes off the mirror with his hand, erasing the
     word.

     Angela is standing behind him in the door opening-                  

                                ANGELA
                  I'm off... Amy called me today, she's                  
                  worried about you. What's happening,                   
                  Ben?

                  I'm your sister, you can talk to me.                   
                  Is it your new job? That place, the                    
                  Mayflower, has bad vibes. It's getting                 
                  under your skin. Just think about what                 
                  I told you...

                              BEN
                  I made a deal, Angie... I can't just                   
                  walk out on them like that. I need                     
                  this job, I need the money. I'm not                    
                  going to sleep on your couch for the                   
                  rest of my life!                                       

                              ANGELA
                  You won't have any trouble finding
                  another one. A daytime job, a regular                  
                  job...                                                 

     While she's talking, we see the scene from another point of view- 
     from inside the mirror- As if SOMEONE ELSE WAS LISTENING TO       
     THEM.                                                             

     Angela leaves the bathroom. Ben brushes his teeth. He leans over
     to rinse his mouth, and when he straightens up-

     IT IS NOT HIM IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRROR, BUT GARY LEWIS       
     WHO SLASHES HIS THROAT FROM END TO END WITH A SHARP PIECE OF        
     MIRROR-                                                             

     Ben steps back and loses his balance, knocking down a shelf.
     Angela rushes into the bathroom-                                    

                              ANGELA (CONT'D)                            
                  What happened Ben? Are you all right?

     He refuses her help.                                                

                              BEN
                  LEAVE ME ALONE...                                      

     Ben gets to his feet and looks into the mirror. His reflection
     is back. Everything looks normal but-

     WHEN HE TURNS TO EXIT THE BATHROOM, HIS REFLECTION STAYS STILL,     
     WATCHING HIM...

59   EXT. DAY- GARY LEWIS' BUILDING                                 59

     The sun sets behind the Harlem skyline.

     Ben's Oldsmobile pulls over in the street- He has decided to
     pass by Gary Lewis' old house before his nightshift.

     He presses the doorbell next to Gary Lewis' name. An old lady
     answers-

                              BEN
                Mrs. Lewis... Sorry to bother you... My
                name is Ben Carson. I worked with                        
                Gary, at Mayflower. Could I come up
                and talk to you for a few minutes?

     Silence.

                            BEN (CONT'D)
                Mrs. Lewis ?

                              MRS. LEWIS
                ...5th floor, apartment 3B...

     The entrance door of the building opens.

60   INT. DAY- MRS. LEWIS' APARTMENT                                60

     MRS. LEWIS is at least 80 years old, and almost blind behind her
     thick glasses. She lives alone in the small apartment that she
     used to share with her grandson.

     We sense that she is distraught by Gary's death.

                              MRS. LEWIS
                ...My Gary hadn't slept at home for
                three weeks. At first I figured he had
                found himself a girlfriend, so I
                didn't worry much about it... It's
                terrible. The policeman told me that
                he was living in the streets... They                     
                found his body in the subway. Why? He
                had everything he needed here. Every
                morning I would have his breakfast
                ready when he'd come home from work.

                              BEN
                  Did he use any drugs?

                              MRS. LEWIS
                  Gary? Huh-huh! Never... He was a good
                  boy.

                              BEN
                  Did you notice anything different, the
                  days prior to his leaving the house,
                  anything unusual in his behavior?

                              MRS. LEWIS
                  Oh yes, but that goes way back to when
                  he started working at Mayflower.

                              BEN
                  What kind of changes?

                                MRS. LEWIS
                  He didn't care much for anything
                  anymore. Before, we'd sit up and watch
                  television together. But once he
                  started that job as a night watchman,
                  he'd spend all his time-off locked up
                  in his room...

                              BEN
                  Sleeping?

                              MRS. LEWIS
                  He hardly slept anymore... He was way
                  too busy!

                              BEN
                  Busy doing what?

                              MRS. LEWIS
                  That, I don't know... I never knew what
                  he was up to...

     She reaches for a picture frame on the chest.

                              MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D)
                  Look, in this picture he was twelve
                  years old...

                              BEN
                  Is that you standing next to him?

                              MRS. LEWIS
                  Yes, back in the days...

                              BEN
                  Mrs. Lewis, I found a note that Gary
                  wrote.

                            BEN (CONT'D)
                A piece of paper, where he'd scribbled
                down the name, Esseker... Does that mean
                anything to you?                                         

                            MRS. LEWIS
                Esseker, is that what you're saying?

     The old lady dwells on it for a moment-

                            MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D)
                No, that don't mean a thing to me...

     She sets down the picture frame.                                    

                            BEN
                May I see his room?

                            MRS. LEWIS
                Yes, of course. Come, follow me, it's
                down the hallway, the door at the very
                end.

     Ben follows Mrs. Lewis to her grandson's room-

     It looks nothing like the room of a fifty-year-old man, but
     rather like that of an old teenager. From what we can see, Gary
     grew up in here, and each object recalls a stage in his life.
     Everything is clean and in its proper place, it is perfectly
     tidy.

                            BEN
                Do you mind if I stay in here for a
                moment?

     Mrs. Lewis smiles at him. She too, likes to gather her thoughts
     in Gary's room.

     Ben scrutinizes the room in search of a clue, a hint that might
     help him on the Esseker lead. He opens the drawers and looks
     through the papers-

     Nothing is of any help to him. The only place left that he
     hasn't searched is the walk-in closet, whose half-open doors
     seem to invite him to enter...

     What Ben discovers inside is beyond anything he could ever have
     imagined- The closet has been emptied out completely, and
     MIRRORS COVER EACH AND EVERY WALL, FROM THE FLOOR TO THE
     CEILING! - It's a miniature replica of the hidden room that Ben
     discovered back in the basement of the department store...

                            MRS. LEWIS
                He would spend hours looking at
                himself...

     Mrs. Lewis steps up behind him-

                               MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D)
                 To look at oneself too much is a sin.
                 A terrible sin. Do you know sir in the
                 Garden of Eden in order to seduce Eve,
                 Satan did not keep the appearance of a
                 snake... Satan reproduced the young
                 woman's traits in such a way that Eve
                 would only see and listen to the image
                 of herself... As in a mirror.


61    INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER                                        61

      Night has fallen. The department store is calm and silent.

      We move down each floor to the entrance hall. The basement door
      is open and, in the darkness, we see the gleam of the
      flashlight. Ben must be down there.

      ALL OF A SUDDEN, A LOUD SHRIEK TEARS THROUGH THE SILENCE. There
      is a woman, somewhere in the store.

      Ben runs up to the entrance hall at full speed. The shrieks
      resound through the department store again. They seem to come
      from one of the floors above.

      Without hesitation, Ben dashes up the stairs-

      He arrives on the second floor and searches through all the
      departments. Impossible to tell where the cries originate from.

      He climbs up to the third floor. The beam of the flashlight
      sweeps past each nook and dark corner-

      Somewhere in the store, the woman continues to scream and wail
      to death.

                             BEN
                     (shouting)
                 WHERE ARE YOU?!!

      No answer. Ben goes up to the fourth floor. The shrieks are
      heard again, but this time, coming from one of the floors below.
      Ben dashes for the Ladies' department-

                               BEN (CONT'D)
                 STAY CALM... I'M COMING!                                 


61A   INT. NIGHT - LADIES' DEPARTMENT DRESSING ROOMS                61A   

      The screams come closer. Ben passes the counters and enters the
      dressing rooms - or rather, what is left of them since the fire.

      The woman must be in here, hiding somewhere.



                                                           (CONTINUED)

                   I'm here Ma'am...

      Short of breath, Ben inspects the dressing rooms with his
      flashlight.

      The woman seems to have vanished.

                               BEN (CONT'D)
                   Ma'am? I'm right he...

      ANOTHER SHRIEK IS EMITTED, RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. He turns around-

      No one there.

      About to leave the dressing rooms, Ben catches sight of a
      mirror. In the reflection he sees the row of empty rooms-

      A BLOODY HAND BURSTS OUT FROM THE LAST ONE, ACCOMPANIED BY
      ANOTHER PIERCING SCREECH OF PAIN!

      Ben runs to it, but finds it empty. IN THE REFLECTION OF THE
      MIRROR, HOWEVER, THE HAND IS STILL STRETCHED OUT TOWARDS HIM!

      Ben stops to think- If he can somehow move the mirror to have it
      face the last booth, he might be able to see what truly happened
      inside.

      Ben unhooks the mirror.

      It is way too heavy and bulky to carry. He lets it slide down
      the wall.

      Inch by inch, Ben hauls the mirror across the floor.

      He reaches the last dressing room-

      Through the reflection in the mirror, he examines the interior
      of the cubicle.

      In the dark he catches sight of BARE FEET STAMPING AGAINST THE
      TILED FLOOR. The torn, half-burnt curtains conceal the rest of
      the body...

      With his eyes fixed on the mirror, Ben walks backward towards
      the dressing room. He is scared of what he is about to discover.
      He gives the curtain a quick yank, revealing-

      A NAKED YOUNG WOMAN IS GOING INTO SPASMS AND SCREECHING WITH
      PAIN. DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF REAL FLAMES, HER SKIN AND FLESH ARE
      ROASTING, AS IF SHE WERE BURNING ALIVE FROM THE INSIDE OUT!

      We are in the darkness of Daisy and Michael's bedroom. Michael
      is terrified and cries out for his mother-

                              MICHAEL
                 Mom! Mom!

      Amy swings the door open and turns on the light.

                             AMY
                 What is it Michael?

      The little boy throws himself into his mother's arms. Daisy
      wakes up.

                             AMY (CONT'D)
                 What is it? Did you have a bad dream?

                             AMY
                 Where Michael?

      Michael points to the mirror wall facing the bunk beds.            

                               MICHAEL
                 There... In the mirror...

                               AMY
                 No, Michael... Look, there's nothing
                 there.

                             MICHAEL
                 I saw her mom. I swear I did.

                             AMY
                 It was just a nightmare. It's late,
                 you have to go back to sleep. I'll
                 turn on the night-light, if you want.

      Amy tucks him into bed and kisses him. Before leaving the room
      she plugs in the night-light.

                             DAISY
                 Mom, can you leave the door open?

                             AMY
                 Sure sweetheart... OK, you two go to
                 sleep now.

     In his bed, Michael cannot stop himself from staring at the
     dimly lit mirror.


63   INT. NIGHT - AMY'S BEDROOM                                     63

     Amy goes back to her room. The local news play on the TV. She
     gets into bed and turns off the light. She reaches for the
     remote and clicks the TV off, turning over-

     THE NAKED BURNED WOMAN FROM THE STORE STANDS STILL IN THE
     REFLECTION OF THE TV SET.

     The entity watches Amy while she is sleeping.

     Once again, the POV from behind the mirror. OMINOUS, SLIGHTLY
     DETACHED AND MUTED.

                                                                 CUT TO:

     Ben secures the padlock of the department store entrance.

     He walks towards the trailer, while keeping a fixed eye on the
     facade of the building. The scene he just witnessed in the
     dressing rooms has shaken him up.

     He goes inside. Through one of the windows we see him pick up
     the phone and dial a number-


65   INT. NIGHT - APARTMENT QUEENS / INTERCUT INT. NIGHT - LODGE    65     

     Angela is in the bathroom when the phone starts ringing. She
     turns on the tap of the cast-iron bathtub and goes to answer.

                              BEN(O.S.)

                              BEN (O.S.)                                 
                  You were right about the Mayflower...                  
                  I'll quit tomorrow.                                    

                              ANGELA                                     
                  That's the smart thing to do, Ben. You
                  deserve better than that. You should
                  come back here and get some sleep.                     

                              BEN (O.S.)
                  No, I'll wait till the daytime guy                     
                  gets here to tell him.

                              ANGELA
                  Are you sure?

                              BEN (O.S.)
                  Yeah, sure. See you later, Angie.

                                ANGELA
                  Be careful... Love you.                                

                              BEN                                        
                  Love you too, sis.                                     

     She hangs up the receiver and stays in the dark for a moment,
     concerned.

     The sound of the pouring bath brings her back to reality.

     We follow her into the bathroom. She dips her fingers into the
     water to check the temperature. The bathtub is almost full.

     Angela undresses in front of the medicine cabinet mirror. When
     she turns around to climb into the hot bath, HER REFLECTION
     REMAINS MOTIONLESS IN THE MIRROR, STARING BLANKLY AT EACH OF HER
     MOVEMENTS.

     Unaware, Angela soaks into her hot bath.

     The water continues to pour from the tap.

     Angela shuts her eyes- It's been a long day.

     IN THE MIRROR, ANGELA'S REFLECTION FIXES HER WITH A COLD GLARE-



                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                                47.

     Without a word, Angela's reflection brings its hands to its face
     and digs its fingers into its mouth. In a sudden jerk, it pulls
     open its jaw-

     AS IF SHE WERE ELECTROCUTED, ANGELA'S BODY CONTORTS VIOLENTLY
     FORWARD. HER MOUTH IS DEFORMED, AS IF AN INVISIBLE FORCE WERE
     WRENCHING IT WIDE OPEN.

     IN THE MIRROR, HER EVIL DOUBLE CONTINUES TO PULL OPEN ITS MOUTH,
     SUDDENLY RIPPING ITS JAW OFF WITH THE SOUND OF CRACKING BONES
     AND CARTILAGE-

     AT THE SAME INSTANT, IN THE BATHTUB, ANGELA HAS NO TIME TO REACT
     BEFORE SHE UNDERGOES THE SAME AGONIZING TORTURE!                        

     The mirror cracks by itself.                                            

     The bathtub overflows with red water spilling out on the white
     tiled bathroom floor.

                                                        FADE TO BLACK


66   INT. DAY -   APARTMENT QUEENS - THE NEXT MORNING                   66   

     The camera flashes illuminate the crime scene.

     Angela's body lies afloat in the bathtub. The apartment is
     entirely flooded.

     Two men in police uniforms close off a security zone, to keep
     the intrusive neighbors away.

     A detective is interrogating an old Puerto Rican couple- the
     downstairs neighbors. They were the ones who alerted the police,
     after having noticed the water leakage. The old woman explains
     how "it was raining blood into her living room"...

     Amongst the police officers and the legal medical squad, we find
     Larry. He is in charge of the case.                                     

     Leaning over the bathtub, Larry examines the visible parts of           
     the corpse. Angela's face is concealed by her own long black
     hair, floating in the murky water.

     Larry slips on an examination glove, pulls up his sleeve and            
     sinks his arm into the blood-red bath. He feels around for the          
     chain of the plug in order to drain the bathtub.

     The water level begins to recede, gradually revealing Angela's
     naked corpse.

     With the tip of his fingers, Larry lifts away the few strands of        
     hair covering Angela's face-




                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                               48.
66   CONTINUED:                                                      66


     Taken by surprise, he steps back from the horrifying sight of          
     this JAW-LESS FACE.

     Larry removes his glove, wipes off his bloodied arm and starts         
     to leave the bathroom when something else catches his attention-       

     He comes closer to the spiderweb cracked medicine cabinet              
     mirror. A TINY DROP OF BLOOD is dripping from one of the cracks.       

     Strange.

     A DARK SILHOUETTE PASSES BEHIND HIM IN THE REFLECTION. He turns        
     immediately- The bloodied bathroom is still and silent. Angela's       
     destroyed body lies in the empty bathtub.

     A police inspector in the next room, calls out to him-                 

                              POLICE INSPECTOR O.S.
                  Larry? Take a look at this...                             

                                LARRY                                       
                  What is it?

                              POLICE INSPECTOR O.S.
                  Come take a look for yourself.                            

     Larry exits the bathroom. The police inspector in the living           
     room holds a picture frame in his hands. He turns towards Larry-       

                                POLICE INSPECTOR
                  Look... Isn't Ben Carson in the picture?                  

                                                             CUT TO:


67   INT. DAY - POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM                    67

     Still wearing his uniform, Ben is sitting alone in one of the
     interrogation rooms of the police station. His haggard face
     expresses great grief. His sister's death has left him                 
     distraught.

     He fiddles with an empty plastic cup in his hands.

     The classic two-way mirror facing him, throws back his
     reflection.

     Ben knows that he is being watched.

     Behind the two-way mirror, Amy observes him. Larry is standing         
     next to her.

                              LARRY                                         
                  The water has obliterated most of the                     
                  marks. No trace of struggle or broken                     
                  entry, the entrance door was locked.

                              LARRY (CONT'D)
                  The person who did this must have had                   
                  the keys to her apartment, or                           
                  otherwise it was somebody she knew...                   

                              AMY
                  He would never have laid a finger on                    
                  her. When their father died, Ben took                   
                  care of his sister. Angela meant the                    
                  world to him.                                           

                              LARRY                                       
                  Listen, so far, his statement is                        
                  pretty consistent with the facts... We
                  checked it out, he did place a call
                  from work at 12:30, and the woman's                     
                  downstairs neighbors claim they
                  started noticing the water leakage at
                  around two in the morning. The daytime
                  security guard, Lorenzo Sappeli,
                  confirms he came on after Ben's shift
                  at seven a.m. The only strange thing,
                  and it may just be a coincidence, is
                  that Ben told Sappeli that he had
                  decided to quit his job, as if he was
                  planning to go away somewhere... Did he
                  mention anything about it to you?

                              AMY
                  No, lately, communication hasn't quite
                  been our strong point...
                      (she smiles)
                  I only found out yesterday that he was                  
                  staying at his sister's. What are you                   
                  going to do with him?

                  I figure we'll let him go. At this                      
                  point we haven't got any real reason                    
                  to keep him here. And, I think he's                     
                  had his share for the day.                              

                              AMY                                         
                  You know what's gonna happen if you                     
                  let him go. He won't stop here. I know                  
                  him, he won't stop until he finds who                   
                  did this to her.

                  Listen, where we stand now, we got                      
                  nothing, not a single clue. I'm sure                    
                  he can help us.

     Amy comes closer to the two-way mirror. She looks at her ex-

68   EXT. DAY - POLICE STATION                                         68

     Ben has been released.

     Under the pouring rain, on the front steps of the police
     station, Amy tries to reason with him-

                            AMY
                You have to see someone Ben. You                            
                cannot stay in this situation any
                longer. You need help, psychological
                support.

     Ben is not listening. His mind is elsewhere.

                            AMY (CONT'D)
                Why don't you...if you want...come spend a                  
                few days at home, with the kids?

                No, I don't want to put them in any
                danger.

                Ben, look at me! I don't want you to
                get into any trouble. Think about
                Daisy and Michael. You are not going
                to solve this case. Please, stay out

                   I know who did this Amy.                                 

                               AMY
                   In that case, you have to tell them                      
                   everything.

                                 BEN
                   They wouldn't believe me and neither
                   would you... Goodbye.                                    

      Ben walks away, leaving Amy alone on the steps of the police
      station

                                  AMY
                   Ben, wait...

      Ben does not turn around. The rain is beating down harder and
      the thunder grumbles in the distance. The first lightning             
      flashes light up the sky.                                             

      Another flash-


68A   - QUEENS APARTMENT -                                            68A   

      Ben ignores the crime scene's restriction perimeter and enters        
      Angela's apartment. Without turning on the light, he goes             
      straight for a leather pouch stashed among his cardboard boxes.       

      Inside- A .357 MAGNUM, his former cop weapon.                         

      Another flash-                                                        


69    EXT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER                                          69    

      The lightning bolts illuminate the facade of the department
      store.

      Ben's car is parked in front of the construction fence.


70    INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER                                          70

      The rainwater pours through the openings in the roof,
      penetrating the interior of the deserted department store. It
      dribbles down the cracked walls and over the half-burnt
      mannequins...


71    INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER BASEMENT- MIRROR ROOM                    71

      We hear the echo of the roaring thunder outside, but in the
      gloom of the flooded basement, there is another blaring sound-



                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                             52.

     A DULL METALLIC THUD. It gets louder and louder, closer and
     closer as we advance towards the opening to the mirror room-

     Inside, we find Ben, out of his mind, throwing a chair against      
     the mirrors with all his strength, in an attempt to demolish
     them-                                                               

     He's exhausted and he's forced to stop.

     Not a single shard of glass, not even a scratch, the mirrors
     seem completely indestructible...

     Ben is not through with them. He drops the chair to the ground
     and pulls out the gun from his belt.                                

     Without a moment's hesitation he opens fire-

     THE MIRRORS SHATTER VIOLENTLY, CRACKING WITH THE POWERFUL IMPACT    
     OF THE BULLETS. In the spiderweb-cracked mirror, his image is       
     deformed.                                                           

     Having found a weak spot, Ben savors his sweet victory when,
     suddenly, something inconceivable unfolds before his very eyes-

     THE BULLET IMPACTS DISSOLVE AS IF BY MAGIC AND THE MIRRORS ARE
     RECONSTITUTED!

     Ben's shock and disbelief give way to rage. He fires, in a fury,
     emptying the entire clip this time-

     Again, the bullet holes vanish, leaving Ben alone, face to face
     with his own reflection. He breaks down nervously-

                              BEN
                  Why did you do it? WHY? WHY DID YOU
                  HAVE TO KILL HER?

     Silence.

                              BEN (CONT'D)
                  What is it you want? What do you want
                  from me? ANSWER ME! WHAT IS IT YOU
                  WANT?!

     Suddenly, one after the other, letters, start appearing in one
     of the mirrors, as if an invisible finger were tracing them in
     the dust-

     REKESSE

     Ben turns around, and in the reflection of the opposite mirror
     he recognizes the inverted word- the same word he found on the
     note in Gary's wallet, the word Ben himself had traced in his
     bathroom mirror-

                                                             CUT TO:


72   INT. NIGHT -QUEENS APARTMENT                                       72

     Back in the Queens apartment, Ben still hasn't gotten any sleep.        
     On the wall, he is assembling all the newspaper clippings,
     articles and photographs that Gary sent him.

     Each and every mirror in Angela's apartment has been covered            
     with sheets, blankets, old rags- anything he could find to              
     neutralize the reflective surfaces.                                     

     With the phone cradled between his ear and shoulder he is in the
     middle of a heated conversation-

                                BEN
                  ...Look up Esseker... Yes, Echo, Sierra,                   
                  Sierra, Echo, Kilo, Echo, Romeo...
                  Esseker. No idea, my guess is that                         
                  it's a name... No, I haven't got a first
                  name. Yes, in New York. Over the past
                  five or six years. I know it's hazy
                  but that's all I've got. I already
                  looked it up in the phone book. I also
                  called someone at the IRS and at the
                  DMV, but nothing there. It's very                          
                  important Larry. You'll call me back?                      
                  Ok...

     Ben hangs up the phone and remains in front of the wall covered
     with clippings for a moment. Now he can have a clear overview of
     Gary's investigative research.

     All the articles date back approximately to the same period and
     are all related to the fire that ravaged Mayflower five years
     ago.

     But not a hint of Esseker.

     Ben studies the newspaper clippings, trying to piece the story
     together-

     " Deadly Fire at Mayflower- 29 dead and 78 wounded "                    

     "   Brutal Massacre- Mother and her three daughters slaughtered..."     

     " ...the children, drowned, in the bathtub... "

     " ...the throat slit open... "

     " Mayflower's security guard taken in for questioning... "




                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                              54.

     " The night watchman confesses to setting the fire but firmly
     denies the accusation of murdering his family... "

     " Terrence Berry confesses but claims the mirrors are guilty-
     The security guard at Mayflower finally confesses. He started
     the fire in the department store with the intention of
     destroying the mirrors, responsible, according to him, for the
     death of his wife and three daughters. "

     Ben observes Terrence Berry's face in one of the archive
     photographs. He looks like a perfectly normal guy, rather kind,
     surely he was a good father... Ben can't help but empathize with    
     him.                                                                

     As he looks up, Ben catches a glimpse of his reflection in the      
     window-                                                             

     What if he too lost his mind and went on to slaughter his
     family? Or what if the mirrors would do it?                         

     The phone rings-

                                BEN (CONT'D)
                  Yes, so, what'd you find out? Nothing
                  under that name? Shit, shit, shit,
                  shit... Can you look up Berry, Terrence
                  Berry...

     Ben holds on the line, for a moment.

                                BEN (CONT'D)
                  ...Got anything? Great...No, I already
                  know all that. Is he still alive? No...
                  Can you find out where he was
                  committed before his death? Wait, I'm
                  writing it down...

     Ben sits down on the bed and scribbles down the address on a
     piece of paper.

                              BEN (CONT'D)
                  ...Roosevelt Psychiatric Detention                     
                  Center... Yeah, I know where it is.                    
                  Thanks.

     He hangs up the phone. Under the blanket, next to him, he spots
     the T-shirt that his sister was wearing the other night.            

     The pain is too strong. He cannot hold back his tears anymore       
     and starts crying.

73   INT. DAY -NEW JERSEY HOUSE - KITCHEN                           73

     The next morning -

     Heavy-eyed and sleepy, Michael is hypnotized in front of the
     weather forecast on TV.

     The hot chocolate set in front of him is getting cold. His
     sister Daisy pours herself some more orange juice. Amy, shaking
     a box of cereal, interrupts the little boy in his dream state-

                            AMY
                Do you want the cereal in your hot
                chocolate or in a separate bowl?

     The little boy does not answer.

                             AMY (CONT'D)
                Michael?

                            MICHAEL
                In the chocolate...

                              AMY
                ...In the chocolate, please, mom...

                              MICHAEL
                      (repeating after her)
                ...Please, mom.

     She pours the cereal in his hot chocolate.

                            DAISY
                Yuck, that's gross, how can you eat
                that?

                            AMY
                Come on, come on, let's get going, or
                you're going to be late for school.

     Michael begins to eat his breakfast, his gaze still fixed on the
     weatherman's forecast on TV. As Amy fills the cat's bowl with
     pellets, Tiger rushes over to join the rest of the family.

                             DAISY
                Mom?

                            AMY
                What is it sweetheart?

                            DAISY
                Do you know that Michael has a new
                friend?

                              MICHAEL
                  No, that's not true!

                              AMY
                  Really, what's his name?

                              MICHAEL
                      (to his sister)
                  You promised not to tell.

                              AMY
                  Does he go to your school?

     Michael doesn't answer. Daisy shakes her head.

                                AMY (CONT'D)
                      (pretending to be
                       indifferent)
                  Very well. If you don't want to tell
                  me about it...

     The little boy stays quiet.

                              MICHAEL
                  He doesn't want me to talk about him.

     Amy suddenly becomes more concerned and sits down next to
     Michael-

                              AMY
                  Why doesn't he want you to talk about
                  him? Is he a grown up?

                             MICHAEL
                  No...

                              AMY
                  So, he's a little boy your age, then?

     Michael gives a reluctant nod. Amy is reassured. He finishes his
     mug of cereal and goes to place it in the sink. Amy gives Daisy
     a questioning look-

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                      (to Michael)
                  Does he live in our street? Is it one
                  of our neighbors?

     Michael remains silent and Daisy answers for him-

                              DAISY
                  He lives in the mirror in our room.

     Daisy bursts out laughing... Michael glares back at her, furious.

     Puzzled, Amy reflects briefly on Daisy's remark-

                talk to you about the mirrors?

     Amy questions him with her eyes. Michael lowers his.

                our teeth brushed, and our coats on.
                The first one in the car is the
                winner.

     The two kids dash up the stairs. Amy is left alone to clean up
     breakfast.

     She casts a glance at the front hall mirror. Daisy's comment
     lingers in her thoughts.

     Dressed in their coats, Michael and Daisy come running down the
     stairs and rush out of the house... Amy exits the house. The car
     drives away.

     Daisy's cat leaps onto the kitchen table and directs his gaze to
     the mirror-

     FOR NO APPARENT REASON, THE CAT SUDDENLY STIFFENS INTO A
     POSITION OF DEFENSE. HE BRISTLES HIS COAT AND HISSES AND SPITS
     TOWARDS HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR.

     Wide shot- The high security psychiatric hospital stands under a
     leaden sky -                                                          

                            DR. MORRIS (V.O.)                              
                You know, Mr. Carson, when one starts                      
                to perceive one's own reflection as a
                completely separate being, one is
                suddenly confronted with two entirely
                separate egos, two entirely separate
                worlds that can surface at any given
                moment-                                                    

                                                              58.




75   INT. DAY - ROOSEVELT PSYCHIATRIC DETENTION CENTER              75

     DR. MORRIS, the doctor who had once been in charge of Terrence
     Berry, escorts Ben down the corridor-                               

                            DR. MORRIS
                A feeling of self-hatred, generally
                triggered by a psychological shock can
                split the personality in two, hence
                creating two or more personalities
                with distinct memories or behavior
                patterns within the same individual.
                The patient then has a faulty
                perception of the existence of two
                distinct worlds, which are principally
                the "real" word, and the world "inside
                the mirror".                                             

     The two men pass a number of guards and security check-points as
     they head down towards the hospital's film and video archive-

                            BEN
                Did you consider Terrence innocent?

     Dr. Morris swipes his magnetic card through the electronic
     device, unlocking the door to the archives.

                            DR. MORRIS
                In my opinion, he was convinced that
                he was telling the truth when he
                claimed he didn't kill his family. I
                too am convinced that when it
                happened, Terrence was not himself,
                but rather his double, his mirror
                image, one might say.

     He enters the archives, followed by Ben-                            


76   INT. DAY - ARCHIVES- ROOSEVELT PSYCHIATRIC DETENTION CENTER    76   

     Dr. Morris' finger glides across several DV-tapes dated 2001 in
     search of one particular tape-

                            DR. MORRIS
                These recordings are from Terrence's
                trial. You will find that they speak
                for themselves.

     He pushes the tape into the deck. A grainy picture appears on
     the screen-

     We discover TERRENCE BERRY, sitting behind a desk. His hands are
     cuffed. Facing him, DR. MORRIS is leading the cross-examination.

     Terrence is tense and uncomfortable. He keeps his face down,
     never looking into the camera.

     DESPITE HAVING SURVIVED THE FIRE, TERRENCE'S FACE IS NONETHELESS
     DISFIGURED BY THIRD DEGREE BURNS. HE NO LONGER HAS FACIAL
     FEATURES, AND HE STRUGGLES WITH HIS SPEECH.

                              DR. MORRIS (CONT'D)
                  Why did you set the department store
                  on fire?

                                TERRENCE
                  In order to... to destroy the mirrors.
                  Only fire can destroy a mirror, isn't
                  that right, Doctor?

                              DR. MORRIS
                  What made you think you absolutely had
                  to destroy those mirrors, Terrence?

     Terrence remains silent. Dr. Morris repeats his question-

                              DR. MORRIS (CONT'D)
                  What made you want to destroy those
                  mirrors, Terrence?

                              TERRENCE
                  They killed Helen and my three little
                  girls...

                              DR. MORRIS
                  For what reason? Why would mirrors
                  want to kill your family?

                              TERRENCE
                  Because I didn't...

     Terrence breaks out in tears.

                              DR. MORRIS
                  Didn't do what?

     With his eyes fixed on the video monitor, deep inside, Ben
     already knows the answer that Terrence is about to give...

                              TERRENCE
                  They asked me to find Esseker...   Like                 
                  they did with the others...                             

                              DR. MORRIS
                  Who are the others you're talking                       
                  about?

                              TERRENCE

                And what happened?                                        

                            TERRENCE                                      
                I didn't succeed. I didn't succeed in
                finding Esseker...

     Ben realizes that he's in the exact same situation-                  

                            BEN
                Amy...
                    (to Dr. Morris)
                I have to go.

     He stands to leave. The monitor keeps playing the old footage-       

                            DR. MORRIS                                    
                Tell me about Esseker, Terrence.                          

     Terrence doesn't speak.                                              

                            DR. MORRIS (CONT'D)
                Who is Esseker, Terrence?                                 

     Suddenly, Terrence's behavior shifts to another extreme. He
     stands up, and flying into a rage, he becomes brutal and
     hysterical-

                            TERRENCE
                I DON'T KNOW WHO ESSEKER IS! I DON'T
                KNOW WHO ESSEKER IS, I DON'T KNOW!!

     Terrence becomes uncontrollable. He wrecks the folders lying on
     the desk and throws himself, head first, against a wall mirror
     that shatters to pieces.

     Ben's car comes to a screeching halt in front of his old house.
     Ben rushes inside.


78   INT. DAY -NEW JERSEY HOUSE -   CONTINUITY                       78

     He is beside himself. After seeing the video footage on              
     Terrence, he has been struck with fear and panic for his family-

     Before the perplexed gaze of Rosa and his children, Ben
     agitatedly comes and goes in the hallway of the second floor. He
     is removing the mirrors from each and every room.

     He tears away the bathroom mirror, unhooks the one in the far
     end of the hallway, and removes some from Amy's room...

     Rosa fears more and more for the children and takes them under
     her protective arms. Amy is not back yet.

     The only mirror left that Ben cannot remove, is the one in the
     children's room.

     He rushes down to the basement and comes back with a bucket of
     old paint. He immediately begins to paint the wall mirror in
     order to neutralize its reflection.

                              DAISY
                  What are you doing dad?

                  Everything is OK...

                              DAISY
                  But why are you doing that?

                              BEN
                  I'm doing it to protect you.

     At the same time, Amy's car pulls up in front of the house.

     As soon as she sees the front door open, and the mirrors laid
     out on the landing of the front steps, Amy rushes into the
     house, panic-stricken.

     She races up the stairs to the second floor, barging into the
     children's room where Ben is painting the mirror. She signals
     Rosa to take the kids out.

                              AMY
                  Do you mind telling me what the hell
                  you're doing?

     Focused and determined, Ben does not answer her question.

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                  Ben!

                  I want you to stop what you're doing
                  and get out of our house right now.

     Ben continues to paint the mirror.

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                  If you don't leave immediately, I'm
                  going to call the police, Ben, and I
                  warn you, you will never see your
                  children again. Do you understand what
                  I'm saying?

     Ben stops-

                              BEN
                  You have to trust me Amy, I'm not
                  completely crazy... These mirrors are
                  dangerous. At first, I thought it was
                  only the ones at the store, but now I
                  know they can get you anywhere. They                    
                  got Angela... I promise I'll leave the                  
                  house once I've taken them all down.

                                AMY
                  Do you realize what you're saying,
                  Ben? What is wrong with you? I know                     
                  that what you're going through isn't                    
                  easy. Angela was a part of our lives                    
                  too, but you have no right to do this                   
                  to us... Ever since your obsession with
                  these damn mirrors the kids are scared
                  to death. Your son has nightmares.                      
                  He's scared Ben... Your behavior is
                  starting to rub off on him. He's only
                  5 years old... And I have to protect                    
                  him.                                                    

     Ben can see that she is very upset about the situation. He sets
     down the paint bucket on the floor-

                              BEN
                  Come Amy, come with me, I want to show
                  you something.

     He leads her back down, through the first floor, and out on the
     front steps of the house-

     Ben pulls his Magnum out of his belt and points the gun at one
     of the mirrors he has dragged outside.

     Amy steps back, terrified-

                  it down, BEN... PUT IT DOWN RIGHT NOW!

     Without a moment's hesitation, Ben opens fire. The mirror
     shatters to pieces-

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                  ARE YOU CRAZY BEN? HAVE YOU GONE

     Ben smiles, all excited-

                              BEN
                  Wait, look, you'll see...

     Through the front window, Daisy and Michael witness the scene-

                  SEE WHAT, BEN?! WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO
                  SEE ?!

     Ben keeps a piercing gaze as the bullet impacts the mirror,
     waiting for the magic to do its trick and for the cracks to
     dissolve again-

     BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. THE CRACKS REMAIN, IN A SPIDER WEB PATTERN.

     Behind the front door, Ben notices Michael, watching him, in
     tears.

     Without any evidence, Ben is in over his head.

                                BEN
                  But... I swear to you I... I saw...Amy...

     The neighbors, alerted by the blast of the gun, come out of
     their houses to find out what has happened.

     Ben stands alone, looking like a mad man...

     Amy holds back her tears and tries to stay in control-

                                AMY
                  Get out...now! I don't ever want to see
                  you here again, Ben. And I'll have the
                  lawyers make sure the same goes for
                  the kids. You are insane, Ben, and
                  dangerous... You've got to get help.

     With gun in hand, Ben walks away, dismayed, as he gradually
     becomes aware of the situation he has just created.

     He enters his car and drives off at top speed.

                                                                64.




82   EXT/INT. DAY - ROAD - BEN'S CAR                                  82

     Ben drives nervously. He feels guilty about his conduct in front
     of the children. A thousand thoughts rush through his head,
     leaving him in an utter state of confusion. He doesn't know what
     to do nor what to think anymore.

     Ben reaches for his cell phone and dials Larry's number-

                            BEN
                Hello, Larry? It's me... I'm going to
                need your help again-

                            LARRY (O.S.)
                Come on, Ben... For Christ's sake! What                    
                are you doing?                                             

                            BEN
                Mayflower used to be a hospital before                     
                it became a department store. St.
                John's Hospital. Do you have any idea
                where all the medical records could
                have ended up after it closed down?

                            LARRY (O.S.)
                How am I supposed to know that?!

                            BEN
                Go to the city hall archives... They
                must have something considering it was
                a public hospital.

                            LARRY (O.S.)
                I've got others things to do. I can't                      
                go to City Hall today. I've -                              

                            BEN
                Larry, Larry stop it... If I could go
                myself, I wouldn't be asking you. Go
                to the City Hall archives, and ask
                them to look up Esseker among the
                former patients. Please.                                   

                            LARRY (O.S.)
                Ben, for god's sake, what are you                          
                trying to prove?                                           

                            BEN
                Please, do it for me.                                      

                            LARRY (O.S.)
                You know you're a real pain in the
                ass.

                              BEN
                  Talk to you later.

     Ben hangs up.

     He glances back at the rear view mirror and sees ANGELA'S
     CORPSE, SITTING ON THE BACK SEAT!

     Startled, he loses control of the vehicle. A truck approaches at
     full speed in the opposite lane. He barely avoids the collision.

     Two other cars appear. Ben zigzags in and out, just barely
     avoiding a fatal crash.

     He stops along the edge of the road.

     Ben closes his eyes and rests his head against the steering
     wheel in an attempt to clear his mind. He looks up into the rear-
     view mirror again-

     ANGELA'S REFLECTION IS STILL THERE. Behind her long black hair,
     she fixes him with a milky gaze.

     Ben flies into a rage. HE SMASHES THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR WITH HIS
     BARE FIST, REDUCING IT TO SCRAPS...

     Ben is alone and lost.                                               

                              BEN (CONT'D)                                
                  What have I done? I don't                               
                  understand... What have I done?                         

     Insert on what is written on the side rear-view mirror-              

     "OBJECTS IN MIRROR ARE CLOSER THAN THEY APPEAR"                      


83   EXT. NIGHT -MANHATTAN STREET - NYPD POLICE STATION              83

     Under the pouring rain, the police patrol cars come and go in
     front of the police station.

     A bit further away we recognize Ben's Oldsmobile, parked on an
     adjacent street. Ben is waiting inside.                              

     A man approaches, knocks on the car window and enters the
     vehicle. It's LARRY-                                                 

     The rainwater drips down his raincoat. Under his arm he holds a      
     file of documents, wrapped in a plastic bag.                         

                              LARRY                                       
                  This ought to make you happy...                         
                      (handing him the file)                              
                  Anna Esseker...

     Ben nervously tears open the plastic wrapping-                      

                              LARRY (CONT'D)                             
                  I wasn't quite sure what you needed,                   
                  so I got all of her medical records.                   

                              BEN                                        
                  Perfect, Larry. That's perfect.                        

     Ben skims through the pages. He cannot believe that he has
     finally discovered who Esseker is...                                

                              LARRY                                      
                  Everyone's real edgy up there. You're                  
                  still a fuckin' murder suspect.                        
                  People are wondering why I let you                     
                  out. You have to tell me more. What                    
                  does the history of the Mayflower have                 
                  to do with the death of your sister?                   

                              BEN                                        
                  I don't know exactly. I can't tell                     
                  you, but some really fucked up things                  
                  started happening to me when I took                    
                  the job over there. Nothing makes any                  
                  sense to me either but I have to                       
                  follow my instinct.                                    

     Larry notices the broken rear-view mirror-                          

                              LARRY                                      
                  What happened? Did you have an                         
                  accident?                                              

     Ben is too absorbed in the records. He doesn't answer.              

                              BEN                                        
                  Anna Esseker... Where did you find her                 
                  files? Did you go to City Hall?                        

                              LARRY                                      
                  No, you were wrong about that, they                    
                  had nothing. All the medical records                   
                  from St. John's Hospital are still up                  
                  there with the unclassified cases.                     

     Ben squints at him.                                                 

                              LARRY (CONT'D)                             
                  She was a patient at St. John's in the
                  psych ward run by a Dr. Kane, between
                  March and September 1952. She was only
                  twelve years old when she died...                      

     Ben freezes-

                When the nurses went on their rounds,
                first thing on the morning of October                      
                6th, they discovered that all the
                patients had left their rooms during
                the night and gathered in the main
                room. All of them were dead, including                     
                the girl. Apparently, they had killed                      
                one another... A slaughter house... After                  
                that they shut down the place. Nobody                      
                ever found out what really happened.

                What about the doctor? Dr. Kane?

                            LARRY
                He was arrested. They found him dead
                on the first day of his hearing. He
                had slit his wrists with a piece of                        
                his cell mirror!

     Ben heads home with the file containing Anna's medical records.       
     He walks through the lobby of his building.


85   OMITTED                                                          85   


86   INT. NIGHT - QUEENS APARTMENT                                    86   

     Angela's apartment is plunged in total darkness-                      

     Ben lays Anna Esseker's file on the coffee table and aims the
     desk lamp at his "research corner" on the wall.

     He turns the lamp back at the file and sits down to study it.

     WHY ARE THE MIRRORS ASKING FOR ANNA IF SHE'S ALREADY DEAD? WHY?       
     IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE...                                          

     On an index card filled in by Anna's parents in September 1952,
     Ben finds a Pennsylvania home address.

     Dr. Kane's first diagnosis is irrevocable - "Despite her young
     age, Anna Esseker suffers from severe schizophrenia, leading to
     withdrawal from reality, delusional and violent behavior."

     He shuffles through the first few pages of various                    
     administrative documents.                                             

     His eye lands on several photographs of Anna taken at the time        
     she was admitted to the hospital- She is just a child, yet, six
     male nurses were needed to restrain and immobilize her in front
     of the photographer. Her face is hardly discernible as she
     struggles like a wild animal.

     A high-pitched sound of cracking glass is heard from behind. Ben
     turns around-

     Another loud crack - It comes from one of the covered mirrors in      
     the apartment.                                                        

     Ben rises slowly to his feet and comes closer. He removes the
     sheet hanging on the frame-

     A crack has appeared in the upper corner of the mirror. Ben
     casts his eyes over the reflection. His glance comes to rest on
     Anna's file laying on the desk-

     He goes to fetch the photograph of the little girl and presents
     it to the mirror-

     KRAAAAACK - the crack in the mirror spreads, as if some kind of
     pressure were applied on the other side of the mirror as a
     reaction to the photograph...

                              BEN                                          
                  You're still alive, aren't you?                          

     All of a sudden, Ben realizes something. He runs back to the          
     file on the table and goes through the documents again, one by        
     one.                                                                  

     He stops on a carbon copy of a hospital release form and checks       
     the date.

                  You're wrong Larry, you're wrong...                      

     His eyes light up-                                                    

                              BEN (CONT'D)

     Through the half-opened door at the end of the hallway, we see
     Daisy brushing her teeth before going to school. The little girl        
     is humming as she watches herself in the mirror...

     Amy comes out of her room-

                              AMY
                  Come on, come on... Let's go... Daisy,
                  Michael?

     She passes in front of the children's room and stops- INSIDE,           
     MICHAEL IS TALKING TO SOMEBODY. Amy listens closely, but she can        
     only hear Michael's voice. On the other side of the door, the           
     little boy bursts out in laughter-

     She opens the door and finds her son squatting in front of the
     mirror, talking to his own reflection.

                              AMY
                  What are you doing Michael? Come on,
                  we're going to be late.

     The little boy does as his mother says.      He gets up and dashes
     out of the room.

     Amy's glance freezes in horror. Terrified, she almost loses her
     balance-

     MICHAEL'S REFLECTION IS STILL IN THE MIRROR, SITTING IN A
     SQUATTING POSITION!

     HE LOOKS AT AMY WITH A BIG SMILE.

     Amy attempts to speak but can't-

     The mirror image of her son remains silent.

     Amy steps closer to the mirror and, in the reflection, behind
     the boy, she discovers-

     HER MIRROR IMAGE IS THERE TOO, BEARING THE SAME FORCED GRIN...

     Ben has brought up some more paint from the basement. With Amy's
     help he paints over all the mirrors in the house. In the face of
     this hardship, all the arguments seem far away. We can feel a         
     connection between the two of them.                                   

     The windowpanes and picture frames have been wrapped securely
     with newspaper and tape.

     Every inch of reflective surface in the house, such as the TV-
     screen and the shiny taps, have been "neutralized" with strips
     of masking tape...

     IN NO TIME, THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SURFACE CAPABLE OF REFLECTING
     LIGHT LEFT IN THE HOUSE.

      We fly over a lake- the waters are so placid that the forest and
      outline of the scenery surrounding it reflect off its surface,
      creating two perfectly symmetrical landscapes.

      We glide over the treetops, diving deeper into the forest, to
      follow the main road that zigzags along the slope of the hill.

      The wind blows over the land.

      In the winter season, the muddy fields have little to offer to
      the few starving crows flying over them. A feeling of desolation
      and solitude hangs over the deserted landscape.

      Ben's car has left the asphalt road behind, driving through the
      countryside down a winding dirt road.

      An old farmhouse stands at the very end of the path. If it
      weren't for the parked pick-up truck and the few piglets running
      wild, one would think that the farmhouse was abandoned.

      Ben gets out of the car and goes to knock on the door.

      His shoes sink into the mud. He walks up the steps of the porch
      and peeks inside the house through the front window. In the dark
      he discerns the silhouette of a person who is watching TV. He
      can't help but notice all the mirrors have been covered or           
      turned towards the wall.                                             

      A big dog barks behind the window. Ben steps back, surprised.

      The front door opens before Ben has even made his presence
      known. A young man stares at him in silence.

                                 BEN
                   Hello... Is this the Esseker farmhouse?

      The young man nods.

      A woman's voice is heard from inside-

                   What is it Jimmy?

      The young man looks at Ben questioningly. Apparently he has
      never heard the name before.

      moving around- shows up in the opening of the door -

                 I huh... I am doing some research for a
                 book on the history of St. John's
                 Hospital, in New York...

      Jimmy's mother stares at him for a moment with a suspicious look-

                             JIMMY'S MOTHER
                 Jimmy, go tell grandpa that there's a
                 man here who'd like to talk to him
                 about his sister.


101   INT. DAY - FARMHOUSE BASEMENT                                101

      We are in the dark basement, under the farmhouse. The door to
      the first floor opens, letting the light in. Ben appears next to
      the silhouette of an old man- ROBERT ESSEKER, 80 years old,         
      Anna's elder brother.

      Robert walks down the steps, signaling Ben to follow him-           

                             ROBERT
                 You know, up to this day, the visions                    
                 of Anna's fits still haunt me at
                 night.                                                   

      They walk through the basement towards an old wooden door.          

                             ROBERT (CONT'D)
                  I helped my father fix up this part
                 of the basement, especially for her-

      The old man turns the key in the padlock. Slowly, the door
      swings open, revealing-

                             ROBERT (CONT'D)
                 Her fits were too violent. My mother
                 couldn't take her screams anymore.

      What's left of a very primitive child's room, SURROUNDED BY
      DOUBLE WIRE FENCING AND IRON BARS. Rather than a cell, it more
      resembles a HUMAN-SIZED CAGE, CAPABLE OF RESISTING THE MOST
      FEROCIOUS BEAST.                                                    

      As he's talking, images flash on screen- painful memories from
      that time come back to him-

      Anna being carried to the basement, her innocent eyes full of
      hate. It's even hard to recognize the face of a little girl. Her    
      howling screams. Her nails digging into her own flesh. Her
      unnatural strength and the violent thrashing of her arms and
      legs.

                               ROBERT (CONT'D)
                   We had every priest, doctor, healer,
                   coming from all over the state, one
                   after the other. But no one could help
                   her.                                                   

      Ben comes closer to the iron bars of the cage. He can see Anna's
      scratch marks next to the bed, giving his imagination a taste of
      her plight and suffering.

                               ROBERT (CONT'D)
                   Finally, Dr. Kane from New York
                   answered my parents' cry for help. He
                   rejected the idea of demonic
                   possession, said he didn't believe in
                   it. He was convinced that Anna
                   suffered from a rare form of
                   personality disorder. He wanted Anna                   
                   under his care, at St. John's. My
                   parents were very poor, but he agreed
                   to cover all the hospital costs... In                  
                   less than five months, Dr. Kane had
                   cured Anna. It was unbelievable. She
                   was her old self again. A real miracle
                   of science.

                               BEN                                        
                   And after the hospital?                                

                               ROBERT                                     
                   You don't know? She died there with                    
                   all of Kane's other patients.                          

      Ben takes the old release form out of his pocket and shows it to    
      Robert.                                                             

                               BEN                                        
                   Anna left the hospital two days before                 
                   the massacre. Kane changed the records                 
                   to make her disappear.                                 

                               ROBERT                                     
                   You're not a journalist, are you? What                 
                   do you want?                                           

                               BEN                                        
                   I want to know. After St. John's,                      
                   where did she go?                                      

      Robert stares at Ben, unsure of saying what he's about to reveal    
      to this perfect stranger-                                           

                               ROBERT                                     
                   Anna came back to live with us for a
                   while...

      Robert lowers his eyes.                                             

                             BEN (CONT'D)

                 Because... Because strange things                        
                 started to happen in the house...

                             ROBERT
                 No, not with Anna...

      The old man obviously doesn't want to get into the details. The
      memories are too painful.

                             BEN
                 With the mirrors?

      Robert stiffens, eyeing Ben with a dark look- How does he know?

                             BEN (CONT'D)                                 
                 Mr. Esseker, tell me where I can find
                 your sister. It's very important. It's                   
                 a matter of life and death.                              

      Robert hesitates -

                 Before he died, Kane sent us a letter                    
                 asking us to keep Anna away from
                 mirrors and that whatever happens she                    
                 should be in a place where the mirrors                   
                 could never find her.                                    

                             BEN
                 Where is she now?                                        

                             ROBERT
                 To protect us, she left the house and                    
                 joined the monastic orders, where
                 mirrors are forbidden... St. Augustine's                 
                 monastery, on the road to Midwich.

      Ben's car does a one-eighty turn in front of the farmhouse,
      heading back to the main road.

      Standing on the porch, with an anxious look on his face, Robert
      watches him disappear in the distance.

      He sits down on the steps, and wipes his glasses.

      The crows fly low in the sky- It's a bad sign.

                                                              CUT TO :


103   EXT. DAY - MIDWICH MONASTERY                                   103

      The nuns come and go under the arches of the monastic courtyard.

      A deadly silence prevails over the monastery, where time seems
      to stand still. All these women have taken vows of poverty,
      obedience and chastity to serve god.

      On the other side of the cloister wall, a small winding road
      zigzags between the pine trees. Ben's car draws nearer. He parks      
      in front of the entrance to the monastery.                            


104   INT. DAY - MIDWICH MONASTERY VESTIBULE                         104

      Ben pushes open the heavy front door. The place is dark and           
      silent. He goes to the front desk-                                    

      Behind a wooden screen he can barely make out the two nuns in
      charge of admissions. They are the only nuns granted exposure to
      the outside world. For the rest, physical and visual contact is
      strictly prohibited.

                               SISTER
                   Yes, how can I help you?

                               BEN
                   Hello Sister. I have come to visit a
                   member of your community... Sister Anna?                 
                   Her real name is Anna Esseker.

                   Is she expecting you?

                   way from New York and that I work with

                   Wait here for a moment.

      She stands up and escapes through one of the back doors.

      The other nun behind the screen, observes Ben with curiosity.

      Time goes by, and Ben grows impatient.


107   INT. DAY - HOUSE NEW JERSEY                                     107   

      Inside the house in Jersey, Amy has isolated herself with the         
      kids in the parent's bedroom. She's reading them a bedtime            
      story.                                                                

      Even if all the windows, screens, and TV are covered by               
      newspapers or painting, Amy acts in front of Daisy and Michael        
      as if nothing has happened.                                           

      In the rest of the house, everything has been meticulously            
      covered, wrapped, painted or reversed. Still, here and there, a       
      barely audible rustle pierces through the silence-

      In the children's room, the paint covering the mirror slowly
      begins to flake off...

      The newspaper wrapped around the windowpanes begins to rip...

      THE MIRRORS ARE RESISTING AND ATTEMPTING TO SET THEMSELVES FREE.      


107A INT. DAY - MIDWICH MONASTERY VESTIBULE                        107A

      Ben is losing his calm. Time is running out. The nun reappears        
      behind the wooden screen-

                               SISTER

                   you may proceed to the parlor next
                   door.

      Ben crosses the hall and opens the door that the nun gestures
      him to.

      He enters the parlor alone. In the spare room, a chair stands by
      a wooden screen, fencing him off, once again.

     Behind the screen, a silhouette awaits him.

                              SISTER ANNA
                  St. John's closed down in 1952. Who

     Ben sits down. Even at a short distance he cannot discern the
     face of Anna Esseker, who is now Sister Anna.

                              BEN
                  My name is Benjamin Carson. I work as                  
                  a night watchman at 1229 West 38th                     
                  Street in New York City, what used to
                  be St. John's Hospital.

                              SISTER ANNA
                  What is it you want Mr. Carson?                        

                              BEN
                  I need your help.                                      

                              SISTER ANNA
                  My help? I don't quite see how I could
                  possibly be of any help.

                              BEN
                  My wife and children are in danger.                    
                  What is threatening my family is                       
                  asking for you...                                      

     For a split second, Ben makes eye contact with Anna behind the
     screen. She has understood...

                              BEN (CONT'D)                               
                  If you don't help me I may lose the
                  only thing that matters to me.

                              SISTER ANNA                                
                  I cannot leave the precincts. It's                     
                  impossible.                                            

                              BEN                                        
                  Tell me why are the mirrors from the
                  old hospital so determined to find
                  you?

     Sister Anna remains silent-

                              BEN (CONT'D)                               
                  I must know, Sister.

                              SISTER ANNA
                  It is not the wish of the mirrors to
                  find me, but of what is imprisoned
                  inside them. The mirrors are merely
                  windows on our world...

                              BEN
                A window... For what? For whom?                        

                            ANNA
                At the time that I was at St. John's,                  
                Dr. Kane's therapy for personality                     
                disorders consisted of locking the                     
                patient up in a mirrored room for                      
                several days on end, in order to force
                him to confront his own image. I spent                 
                the darkest days of my life in that
                room. On the 6th day the nurses found
                me lifeless, almost dead. Since that                   
                day, I have never had another fit. But
                deep down inside I've always known the
                truth.

                              BEN
                What truth?

                            ANNA
                There is no cure for schizophrenia, it
                was something else, Mr. Carson. And                    
                whatever it was, it entered the
                mirror.                                                

     We can feel the emotion in her voice.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)                              
                I thought that after fifty years, this
                would have all gone away. They would
                have disappeared from the mirrors. I
                didn't know.... I'm sorry but if I                     
                agree to go with you and return to
                that place, I will make it possible
                for them to cross the threshold back
                into the real world.                                   

     Everything is now making sense for Ben-                           

                            BEN                                        
                It entered with you and they need you                  
                to get out.                                            

                            ANNA
                The consequences of such an act, Mr.                   
                Carson, would be more devastating than                 
                letting them suffer where they are                     
                now. I'm going to pray for you and                     
                your family. That's all I can do right
                now, Mr. Carson. God bless you...                      

     She stands to leave.

                             BEN
                 Wait... Please, listen to me- Terence                   
                 Berry, Gary Lewis and many others                       
                 before me... Those are the people who                   
                 died trying to find you. Because they
                 failed, their families died too. My                     
                 sister was murdered two days ago... My                  
                 wife and kids will next if you don't                    
                 come with me. Look-

      From his wallet Ben takes out a wrinkled photograph of Michael,
      as a baby, in Amy's arms. Daisy stands next to them in the
      picture. Ben presses the photograph against the grating for Anna
      to look at it.

                             BEN (CONT'D)
                 My wife and two children. They're all
                 I've got. They're innocent... Please.                   

      Anna stays quiet a moment behind the screen and leaves.            

                             BEN (CONT'D)
                 I KNOW YOU ARE SCARED OF GOING BACK                     
                 THERE. IT'S EASIER TO KEEP HIDING BUT                   
                 THIS IS NOT THE HOUSE OF GOD ANYMORE.                   
                 WHILE YOU'RE PRAYING PEOPLE ARE DYING
                 ON YOUR TIME!                                           

      Anna doesn't respond and disappears in the distance.               

      Ben failed. He's desperate and lost. He has a hard time            
      containing his anger.                                              


105   EXT. DAY - MONASTERY                                         105

      On the horizon, a red sun sets behind the treetops. It's almost
      nightfall.

      The bells from the monastery begin to toll.

      The cross above the monastery reflects upside down in a puddle
      of rain water.

      Frustrated, Ben walks back to his car and dials his home number    
      on his cell phone -                                                


106   EXT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                 106

      In the distance, the lights of Manhattan sparkle in the night.

      In the house, all the lights are off.

      All is quiet, too quiet.                                           

                                                                 83.




108   INT. NIGHT - HALLWAY                                             108

      In the hallway, the shiny doorknob leading to Amy's bedroom is
      the only reflecting surface that has been forgotten.

      In the distorted reflection, we see Michael's silhouette
      approaching. The little boy reaches for the knob but-

      IN REALITY, NO HAND TOUCHES IT-

      IT'S MICHAEL'S REFLECTION INSIDE THE SHINY KNOB THAT IS OPENING
      THE DOOR!

      Inside the bedroom, Amy fell asleep with Daisy in her arms.            

      On the bedside table, THE HOME PHONE STARTS RINGING- She wakes         
      up with a jolt and picks up the cordless receiver-                     

                             AMY                                             
                 Hello? Ben... Where are you? Did you                        
                 find her? Did you talk to...                                

      She stops speaking as she realizes- Daisy is asleep next to her        
      but MICHAEL IS NO LONGER THERE.                                        

                             AMY (CONT'D)
                 Michael? MICHAEL!?                                          
                     (on the phone)
                 Ben hold on, Michael is gone...                             

                             BEN (O.S.)                                      
                 What?

                             AMY                                             
                     (to Ben on the phone)                                   
                 I don't know, I fell asleep with the
                 kids on the bed and...                                      

      She sees that THE BEDROOM DOOR IS HALF OPENED.

                             AMY (CONT'D)
                 Michael?                                                    

      The sound of pouring water is heard, coming from the hallway.
      Michael must be in the bathroom.

                             BEN (O.S.)                                      
                 Amy, what's going on? Are you alright?

      Amy runs to the door, waking Daisy up.                                 

                             DAISY
                 What is it Mom?

109   INT. NIGHT - CORRIDOR/BATHROOM -      CONTINUITY              109

      Amy comes out of the bedroom and notices that the floor is          
      completely soaked.                                                  

      She turns on the light in the hallway, only to discover-

      The entire upper floor is covered by an inch of water- all the      
      taps in the bathroom are turned on and have transformed the
      surface of the floor into A LARGE NATURAL MIRROR...

                               AMY

                   Fuck! There is water everywhere...                     
                   Michael? Michael? MICHAEL?!                            

      Amy freezes when she realizes that all the picture frames and
      all the mirrors in the corridor have been scraped, bringing the
      reflecting surfaces, once again, to the light...

                               AMY (CONT'D)

                   Ben, someone scraped all the
                   mirrors... There is someone in the                     
                   house.

                               BEN (O.S.)

      As she turns in the hallway, Amy sees A DARK SHADOW MOVING IN       
      ONE OF THE MIRRORS. Terrified, she steps back and hits the          
      opposite wall. She drops the phone on the flooded floor-            


109A EXT. DAY - MONASTERY                                          109A

      At the same moment, Ben, still outside of the monastery, is cut     
      off in his conversation with his wife-


                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                             85.

                              BEN
                  Amy? Amy? Answer me?                                   

     He tried to redial but that doesn't work. He knows something        
     weird is happening there.                                           

     Without hesitation, Ben grabs his gun inside the car and walks      
     back towards the monastery gates.                                   


109B -BACK IN THE HOUSE-                                        109B     

     Unsure of what she saw, Amy makes a step towards the mirror but     
     only finds her own reflection.

     She picks up the phone- The water shorted it out...                 

                               AMY                                       
                  Damn it...                                             

     Cautiously, Amy walks up to the bathroom.                           

                               AMY (CONT'D)
                  Michael?                                               

     She opens the door- the sink and bathtub are filled with water
     overflowing onto the tiled floor. Michael is not there.             

                                                           CUT TO:       


109C INT. NIGHT - MONASTERY CELL                                109C

     A hand enters frame to light some candles.                          

     Sister Anna is back in her cell. The way her hand shakes as she     
     carries the match from one candle to the other betrays how upset    
     she is by the confrontation with Ben- It's been too much time       
     that she's carrying the guilt.                                      

     She runs the rosary nervously between her fingers and kneels        
     down in front of her bed to pray when-

     A loud muted sound followed by a sudden wave of agitation is        
     heard outside the cell. Someone has broken into the monastery.      
     She recognizes Ben's voice- Like a mad man, he's looking for her    
     everywhere and threatens the other nuns to show him the way.        

     Anna stands up when Ben bursts into her cell with his gun in his    
     hand. Behind him, the other nuns are terrified.                     

     Ben points the gun at Anna-                                         

                              BEN                                        
                  My kids are not going to die tonight.                  
                  You're coming with me, now.                            


                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                              86.
109C CONTINUED:                                                 109C


      Not intimidated by the weapon, Anna steps towards Ben. FOR THE     
      FIRST TIME, BEN CAN SEE HER FACE- The old lady seems more          
      determined than ever-

                              ANNA
                  If I come with you Mr. Carson, you                     
                  have to promise to do everything I
                  tell you. My way. No questions.

      Ben lowers his gun-                                                

                              BEN
                  You have my word.                                      

                                                           CUT TO:       


110   INT. NIGHT- BEDROOM- MEANWHILE                               110

      Daisy waits patiently in the bed following her mother's
      instructions. Suddenly she hears her mother calling her from the
      children's bedroom-

                                AMY (O.S.)
                  Daisy... Daisy... Come here...                         

      Daisy steps into the corridor and stops, for a moment, when she
      notices the flooding. She enters her bedroom, following the
      voice that calls out for her-

                                AMY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                  Daisy... Daisy...


111   INT. NIGHT - CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUITY                 111

      Daisy explores the bedroom. The voice is still calling, but her
      mother is not there.

      The door shuts behind her.

      She walks up to the mirror on the wall. The paint has been
      partially scraped off-

      THE LITTLE GIRL DISCOVERS HER MOTHER'S REFLECTION ON THE OTHER
      SIDE OF THE MIRROR-


112   INT. NIGHT - BATHROOM - MEANWHILE                            112

      BUT IN REALITY, AMY IS STILL IN THE BATHROOM!

      She turns off the tap and sinks her hand into the depths of the
      bathtub to pull the plug, when she sees Michael's reflection on
      the surface -                                                      



                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                                 87.

                                AMY
                   Micha...

      She turns around, but Michael is not behind her. The reflection
      lied.

      SUDDENLY HER ARM IS PULLED INTO THE BATHTUB.                         

      AN INVISIBLE FORCE PLUNGES HER HEAD INTO THE WATER TO DROWN HER.
      AMY STRUGGLES FRENETICALLY BUT THE PRESSURE IS TOO STRONG FOR
      HER TO BREAK FREE.


113   -BACK IN THE CHILDREN'S BEDROOM-                              113

      Daisy walks up to her mother's reflection in the mirror.

                               AMY'S REFLECTION
                   Come sweetheart... Come, come closer...
                   Come...

      Daisy is mistrustful. She senses that something is not right. In
      the mirror, her mother's attitude is different and strange...

                               DAISY
                   What are you doing in there, Mom?

                               AMY'S REFLECTION
                   Come closer, don't worry... Everything
                   is all right, sweetheart.

      Daisy obeys when, suddenly, she notices that her mother holds a
      pair of scissors in her hand.

      Daisy has no time to react-

      THE REFLECTION OF THE MOTHER GRABS THE REFLECTION OF THE LITTLE
      GIRL, HOLDING HER FIRMLY IN HER ARMS-

      BY SOME INVISIBLE FORCE, IN REALITY, DAISY IS SUSPENDED IN THE
      AIR IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR.


114   -BACK IN THE BATHROOM -                                       114

      With her head still submerged in the bathtub, Amy is drowning.       
      She tries to fight back. Unsuccessfully. Her head stays under
      the water.

      With the tips of her fingers, Amy feels her way to the plug. She
      pulls it out.

      Slowly, the water level begins to go down. Too slowly. Amy
      struggles to pull her head out of the water to breath again.




                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                                 88.
114   CONTINUED:                                                    114


      The water continues to recede. Amy has reached exhaustion, her
      hands clutch onto the edge of the bathtub. She is suffocating.

      At the last minute, she turns her head to gasp for air.

      The remaining water swirls down the drain. The bathtub is now       
      empty and the invisible force seems to have vanished.

      Amy collapses to the ground, spitting and coughing. She comes to
      her senses, gets back to her feet and dashes out of the
      bathroom.

                               AMY
                   Michael?! Michael?

      As she runs past the bedroom, she notices that the door is open-

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                   Daisy !?

      Daisy is no longer there.

                              AMY (CONT'D)
                   Daisy !

      Panicked, Amy crosses the corridor and barges into the
      children's room. Inside she discovers-


115   INT. NIGHT - CHILDREN'S ROOM                                  115

      SUSPENDED IN THE AIR, A FEW INCHES OFF THE GROUND, DAISY
      STRUGGLES TO BREAK FREE.

      In the mirror, Amy sees her own reflection bringing the sharp
      blade of the scissors to her daughter's throat. The blade glides    
      over her skin.

      In reality, A TRICKLE OF BLOOD APPEARS ON DAISY'S THROAT.

      Instinctively, Amy throws herself against Daisy, tearing her
      away from the grip of her own reflection. They land on the floor    
      and crawl to the corner of the room, safe from the danger of the
      reflections.

      Amy tears off a piece of her clothing, which she presses against
      Daisy's throat in order to stop the bleeding.

                               AMY
                   Oh my god, don't move baby, don't
                   move...

      Amy is out of control, holding Daisy tightly in her arms. She is
      terror-stricken by the events in the house...




                                                           (CONTINUED)

                                                              89.
115   CONTINUED:                                                 115


                               AMY (CONT'D)
                   Don't move sweetheart...

      Fortunately, Daisy's wound is not deep. The blade did not reach
      the main artery. Amy saved her life at the very last minute.

      Daisy is half conscious from the loss of blood. She struggles to
      speak-

                               DAISY
                   Why did you do this, Mom?

                               AMY
                       (in tears)
                   It wasn't me Daisy, it wasn't me... I
                   would never hurt you, you know that.

                                 DAISY
                   Whe...where is Michael ?

                                 AMY
                   I don't know where he is... I'm going to
                   take care of you and then we're going
                   to find him...OK But for now, we have to
                   get out of here.

                               DAISY
                   Is Daddy coming back soon?

                               AMY
                   Yes, he'll be here soon as he can.

      A bit further away, in the scraped section of the mirror, we
      can see Amy's reflection, on its knees above Daisy who lies on     
      the floor-                                                         

      IN THIS EVIL VERSION OF THE REALITY, Amy's double has killed her   
      own daughter. Using the scissors, she's "working" on the dead      
      body. What exactly is she doing to the little girl?                

      She turns toward us, revealing HER FACE AND HANDS COVERED WITH     
      FRESH BLOOD!                                                       

      AMY'S REFLECTION COMES CLOSER TO PEEK THROUGH THE MIRROR , WITH    
      HER HANDS PRESSED AGAINST THE GLASS, AS IF IT WERE JUST A
      WINDOW.

      IN SEARCH OF THE REAL AMY AND DAISY, the forces of the mirrors     
      are determined to get them.

      Away from the field of vision of the mirror, Amy crawls on the
      floor towards the door-

                                                              90.




116   INT. NIGHT - BEDROOM                                          116

      Amy comes back to the bedroom, carrying Daisy in her arms.

      As she passes the bureau, she grabs the first-aid-kit from one
      of the drawers. She sets her daughter down in the walk-in           
      closet, away from the mirrors. The little girl has trouble
      moving.

      Amy examines the cut on Daisy's throat. Quickly, with a
      professional touch, she disinfects and bandages the wound.

                             AMY
                 Listen to me carefully Daisy... I want
                 you to stay in here and be quiet.

      Daisy is terrified and with her remaining strength, she holds on
      to her mother tightly.

                             AMY (CONT'D)
                 You have to be brave, sweetheart... I
                 want you to stay in here and not get
                 out until I come back, no matter what
                 happens. I'm going to find Michael... Do
                 you hear me?

      Not quite convinced, Daisy accepts reluctantly.

                             AMY (CONT'D)
                 I am so proud of you.

      Amy shuts the door of the closet. Through the wooden slats she
      can see her daughter inside-

                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                 Don't move...

      Amy exits the room.


117   INT. NIGHT - CORRIDOR/STAIRCASE                               117

      Even though she turned off the taps upstairs Amy can still hear     
      the water pouring downstairs...

      On guard, Amy walks down the stairs, step by step. She is
      frightened and her heart is pounding.

                             AMY
                 Michael ? Michael ?

      At the bottom of the stairs, Amy catches sight of Michael at the
      other end of the living room.

      The first floor is completely flooded. ALL THE SPACE IS COVERED
      BY A THIN LAYER OF WATER THAT'S MIRRORING EVERYTHING IN HOUSE.      

      The little boy has climbed up onto a stool and is scraping the
      paint off the mirror with a sharp knife... It was Michael who had
      scraped all the mirrors in the house in order to set the force
      of the mirrors free.

                               AMY (CONT'D)
                   Michael !

      He doesn't answer. He doesn't seem to hear her.

      Amy comes down the last step.

                               AMY (CONT'D)
                   Michael ? What are you doing?

      The little boy turns around towards his mother with a big smile-

      IN THE MIRROR, HIS REFLECTION REMAINS FACING THEM.

                               MICHAEL
                   They want to come play with us, Mommy.

      Amy moves slowly towards her son.

                               AMY
                   Michael, I want you to drop that
                   knife, do you hear me? You know very
                   well you are not allowed to play with
                   that, don't you?

      Michael looks at her in confusion and steps down from the stool.

                               AMY (CONT'D)
                   That's a good boy, now give me the
                   knife...

      Instead of obeying, Michael runs off and disappears into another
      room on the first floor.

                               AMY (CONT'D)
                   MICHAEL !

      Amy rushes after him.


118   INT. NIGHT - BEDROOM                                         118

      Amy's cell phone, laying on the night table, begins to ring. On
      the display we can see the call is from Ben.

      Through the wooden slats of the closet door, Daisy catches sight
      of the phone.

      She thinks about leaving the closet to answer, but remembers her
      mother's strict instructions about staying in the hiding place.

      The phone continues to ring, but no one answer it.


119   INT. NIGHT - FIRST FLOOR                                         119

      Amy hears the phone ringing upstairs, but she cannot answer it
      now- She must find Michael first.

                                                                CUT TO :


120   EXT/INT. NIGHT - BEN'S CAR - MANHATTAN                           120

      Ben's car drives down a Manhattan street.

      Behind the wheel, Ben is on the phone and gets Amy's voicemail.
      He dials again-

                               BEN
                   Answer! God damn it... Answer the phone...

      Once again he gets the voicemail.

                                BEN (CONT'D)
                   Fuck...

      Ben is losing his calm.


121   EXT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE                          121

      Ben's car pulls up in front of the department store. Through the
      windshield, Anna catches sight of the devastated building.

      Ben hangs up the phone-                                                 

                               BEN
                   Something's wrong over there, my wife                      
                   is not answering.                                          

      Ben is torn - He knows that going back to Amy isn't going to            
      help-

                   We have to get inside the Mayflower                        
                   now.                                                       

      Anna steps out. She cannot conceal the sudden shiver that runs
      through her when she stands in front of the former hospital-

                               ANNA                                           
                   From now on, I'm going to close my                         
                   eyes.

                   Take me to the basement, to the mirror
                   room. It has to stop where it began...                 

      Ben grabs her forcefully-

                               BEN                                        
                   Come on, let's go.

                               ANNA                                       
                   Mr. Carson, no matter what happens in                  
                   there, I want you to do as I say and
                   make sure I never get out of this
                   place.                                                 

      Ben pulls out his keys and unlocks the front door. Anna closes      
      her eyes and follows him inside.


122   INT. NIGHT - ENTRANCE HALL- MAYFLOWER DEPARTMENT STORE        122

      Anna has barely crossed the threshold when the hall mirrors
      start trembling-

      They can feel her presence.                                         

      She tightens her grip around Ben's hand. She is anxious, and
      even with her eyes shut, she can sense the threatening vibes
      sent off by the mirrors.

      Ben is focused, gazing straight ahead as they cross the ground
      floor in the direction of the basement door.

      Yet, from the corner of his eye, he cannot help but glimpse the
      mirrors. What he discovers goes beyond his worst nightmares-

      A CROWD OF MEN AND WOMEN, FLAYED ALIVE, CRAWLING AND PRESSING       
      THEMSELVES AGAINST THE GLASS PANES, INSIDE THE MIRRORS. THEY
      OBSERVE BEN AND ANNA WITH BLANK, LIFELESS GAZES. SOME ARE
      BANGING THEIR FISTS, THEIR HANDS, AND EVEN THEIR HEADS AGAINST
      THE GLASS, IN AN ATTEMPT TO BREAK FREE FROM THE MIRROR.

      SUDDENLY BEHIND HIM, ONE OF THESE VISIONS BASHES AGAINST THE        
      MIRROR! KEEPING ITS WIDE OPENED EYES ON THEM, THE VISION STARTS     
      LICKING THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR LIKE AN ANIMAL.

                               ANNA
                   They are waiting for me...                             

      Ben turns towards Anna and realizes that in the mirror, there's     
      something else-                                                     

      Anna's reflection is different- IT'S NOT THE OLD NUN ANYMORE BUT    
      THE 12 YEARS OLD GIRL, EXACTLY AS ANNA WAS IN THE TIME OF ST.       
      JOHNS HOSPITAL!                                                     

                                                                94.




123   INT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                    123

      We are back in the house.

      Amy is still searching for Michael. She goes into the kitchen to      
      turn off the tap.

      Above the sink, the newspaper on the windows had been ripped as       
      well and the hot steam is now covering the glass. A HAND PRINT        
      APPEARS ON ONE OF THE WINDOW PANES AND SLIDES DOWN AGAINST THE        
      GLASS...                                                              

      The forces are everywhere.                                            

      Amy steps back and runs out of the kitchen.                           

      THE THIN LAYER OF WATER ON THE FLOOR HAS TRANSFORMED THE ENTIRE
      HOUSE INTO A MIRROR EXTENDING THROUGH EACH ROOM.

      AN INESCAPABLE MIRROR...

      The sound of rapid, splashing footsteps catches her attention.
      Amy turns around and leaves the kitchen-

                             AMY
                 Michael ?

      Michael's reflection sweeps over the water surface.

      Amy runs after him but stops short when she catches sight of
      him. Michael is hiding under the living room couch.                   

      She comes closer and bends over- THERE IS NO ONE UNDER THE            
      COUCH!                                                                

      Yet, in the reflection of the wet floor, Michael is there...          

      He smiles at her, playfully.

      IN A QUICK MOVEMENT, THE LITTLE BOY'S REFLECTION BRANDISHES THE
      KNIFE IN EXCITEMENT AND TEARS IT THROUGH HIS MOTHER'S FACE-

      AMY LETS OUT A CRY OF PAIN AS SHE BRINGS HER HAND TO HER CHEEK-
      THE INVISIBLE BLADE HAS SLASHED HER FACE.

      The blood gushes between her fingers. Michael's reflection has
      disappeared.

      She turns around just in time to catch sight of the little boy's
      reflection escaping. His invisible footsteps splash in the water
      as he moves further away...

      She hears Michael run up the stairs to the first floor.

                                                              95.




124   INT. NIGHT - STEP-IN CLOSET                                   124

      Protected from the mirrors, in her hiding place in the closet,
      Daisy inspects the room through the wooden slats.

      Suddenly, the bedroom door squeaks open. Daisy curls up in the
      corner of the closet, overtaken with fear-

      It's only the cat who enters the room with a meow.

                             DAISY
                 Tiger! Come here kitty, come here...

      She opens the door a tiny crack to let him in. The little girl      
      takes the pet in her arms, reassuringly.

125   INT. NIGHT -MAYFLOWER BASEMENT                                125

      In the dark, the surface of the water lies perfectly still. We
      are no longer in the New Jersey house, but in the subterranean
      passageways corridors of the department store.                      

      Ben and Anna's silhouettes appear, walking down the stairs.

      Ben turns on his flashlight. The lights along the corridor are      
      too weak.                                                           

                             BEN
                 Watch your step, a water pipe has
                 burst, the whole basement is flooded.                    

      Ben guides Anna, with her eyes still shut, through the tunnels.

      The beam of the flashlight sweeps across the walls, and the
      piping.                                                             

      They pass the junction of the two tunnels and arrive at the         
      demolished wall.                                                    

                             ANNA                                         
                 You stay outside...                                      

      Anna steps over the rubble as she feels her way into the mirror
      room.

      IN ALL THE MIRRORS IT'S NOT ANNA THE NUN, BUT ANNA THE LITTLE       
      GIRL THAT WE CAN SEE-

      When she places her hand against one of the mirrors, cracks
      appear instantly. The pressure on the other side is growing
      stronger and stronger.



                                                           (CONTINUED)

      Anna positions herself in the center of the room, from where her
      reflection is multiplied to infinity from all the possible
      angles.                                                            

      She kneels down with her eyes closed.

126   INT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                 126

      Compared to the gloom of the basement in the department store,     
      the second floor of the house seems to be bathed in light.         

      Michael is sitting quietly in front of his room. As Narcissus      
      did, he is observing his reflection, mirrored in the surface of
      the water that covers the wooden floor.                            

                                AMY
                   Michael ?

      Hypnotized by his mirror image, the little boy does not hear his
      mother's call.

      Amy appears at the top of the stairs and catches sight of him.

                                AMY (CONT'D)
                   Michael... Michael, look at me... I'm
                   right here.

      Michael doesn't answer. Gently, he caresses his reflection in
      the surface of the water.

      Amy comes up to him slowly, determined to pull him away from his
      reflection...

      She lays her hand on his shoulder.

      This time Michael reacts and turns towards her.

      Before he can utter a single word-                                 

      THE REFLECTION OF THE HAND BECOMES REAL, GRABBING THE CHILD'S      
      WRISTS. MICHAEL'S REFLECTION PULLS HIM THROUGH ITS SURFACE.        
      MICHAEL DISAPPEARS INTO THE FLOOR.

      Amy throws herself to the ground in an attempt to catch him. Too
      late, the little boy has been submerged in the thin layer of
      water covering the floor. MICHAEL HAS BEEN PULLED INTO THE OTHER
      SIDE OF THE MIRROR!

      Amy sees her son struggling under the water, as if he were
      caught under a coat of ice.

                               AMY (CONT'D)
                   Michael, Michael... No, no...

      In desperation, Amy beats her fists against the floor with all
      her strength, trying to break through to the other side.

                               AMY (CONT'D)
                   MICHAEL !! NOOOOO...

      Flying into a rage, she beats her fists again and again in an
      attempt to break the surface and save Michael from drowning.

      She sees Michael's body sinking into the depths...

      Back to the subterranean world of the department store.

      Ben is waiting in the corridor with his gun in hand.

      In the mirror room, Anna recites a prayer for strength. IN THE      
      REFLECTION, YOUNG ANNA IS DOING THE SAME...                         

      The mirrors around her shake more and more violently-

      Anna remains with her eyes still shut.                              

      Ben sees cracks forming on the walls and the surface of the
      water at his feet trembling...


127A INT. NIGHT - MAYFLOWER                                        127A   

      SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN THE REST OF THE STORE AS WELL- ON EACH
      FLOOR, IN EVERY DEPARTMENT, ALL THE MIRRORS BEGIN TO VIBRATE
      UNCONTROLLABLY, TO TWIST OUT OF SHAPE, TO SWELL, TO SHRIVEL AND
      FINALLY-

      ANNA OPENS HER EYES-

      ALL THE MIRRORS EXPLODE!

      FROM ONE AREA TO THE NEXT IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE, THE
      EXPLOSIONS ARE SPECTACULAR AND APOCALYPTIC.

      Anna's eyes freeze- her pupils constrict- thousands of shards
      of glass are sent flying into the air, piercing through her body
      like a dozen sharpened daggers.

      The blow of the explosion causes the walls to tremble.
      Instinctively, Ben takes shelter behind the wall.

      MICHAEL'S BODY REEMERGES TO THE SURFACE!

      Amy clings to him and pulls him out of the water. The little boy
      is unconscious.

      She begins to shake him and to perform mouth-to-mouth
      resuscitation as she applies rhythmical pressure to his chest.

      Amy tries not to lose her head, determined to bring her little
      boy back to life.

      Her eyes fill with tears, blurring her vision. She mustn't lose
      faith. She mustn't give up...

      MICHAEL REMAINS UNCONSCIOUS...                                         


129   INT. NIGHT - MIRROR ROOM / SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS              129

      IN THE BASEMENT, THE CALM HAS BEEN RESTORED.

      Ben is still crouching behind the sheltering wall of the mirror
      room. In the silence, he waits. He must establish beyond a doubt
      that it's all over.

      He aims his flashlight at the surface of the water-

      Everything seems to be back to normal. His reflection is
      deformed by the slight stir of the water, slowly becoming
      placid.

      Ben steps over the rubble to enter the mirror room-

      All the mirrors have been pulverized leaving behind only the           
      metal cage that was holding them in place. The floor is covered        
      with thousands of pieces of mirror floating in the water,
      shimmering in the shadows.

      The beam of the flashlight sweeps the room in search of Anna, or
      her dead body-

      Nothing...

      Ben inspects all the dark corners behind the metal structure -         
      The woman has vanished.

      He aims his flashlight at the ceiling. The beam of light
      instantly reveals a dark shape hanging above him-

      It's her, or at least what is left of her- A POSSESSED,
      METAMORPHOSED, HUMAN FRAME. SHE IS BARELY RECOGNIZABLE.


                                                            (CONTINUED)

                                                               99.

      WITH HER EYES ROLLED UPWARD, HER SLASHED FACE AND HER BODY
      PIERCED BY THE SHARDS OF GLASS, SHE LOOKS LIKE A DEMON, DEPRIVED
      OF ANY HUMAN TRAITS. THE REAL ANNA DISAPPEARED FROM THE MOMENT     
      SHE OPENED HER EYES AND RELEASED THE FORCES OF THE MIRROR.

      Ben has no time to react before "Anna" charges at him.

      He drops his flashlight to the ground, trying to resist her as
      much as he can.

      HER WAY OF MOVING IS NO LONGER HUMAN. MORE LIKE A STROBOSCOPIC     
      CONVULSION, HER MOVEMENTS ARE SOMETHING BETWEEN AN ENRAGED BEAST   
      AND THE WORST EPILEPTIC FIT.                                       

      Ben manages to pin the creature against the wall. "Anna" spits     
      blood in his face.

      He applies all his strength to immobilize her- the shards of
      glass dig deeper into the elderly woman's flesh, which only
      seems to provide her an intense pleasure...

      "Anna" froths at the mouth. Her speech has become a deep,
      animalistic, incomprehensible gurgle.

      In an effortless movement, "Anna" pushes him away.

      Her demonic strength is ten times his. Ben is merely a puppet, a
      rag doll that she sends flying into the air, only to crash
      violently against the brick walls...

      Blood squirts onto the surface of the water.

      Ben smashes into the wall separating the mirror room from the
      underground passageways.

      On the other side, he lands on the ground, in the dark. He         
      strives to regain consciousness...

      Ben takes advantage of the brief respite to pull out his gun but- 

      "Anna" appears from the dark and, in a flash, she strikes a
      backhanded blow that sends the gun off into the air.

      She lifts Ben up and throws him across the room. He rams into
      the wall.

      With the absence of light in the basement, Ben is defenseless.     
      He cannot see his assailant...

      Ben is caught by the leg and dragged backwards. His hand           
      struggles to catch on to anything that could hold him back.

      Suddenly, under the water, his hand lands on the gun. He grabs
      it, turns onto his back, and fires point-blank at "Anna".

      The bullets go flying through her body, but they don't stop her.



                                                           (CONTINUED)

      Ben is being dragged. He manages to grab hold of one pipe after       
      the other, trying to hold on, but the pipe gives way and breaks
      off from the wall, LETTING OUT A POWERFUL JET OF GAS.

      Once again, Ben is sent flying down the tunnel.

      He struggles to get back on his feet-                                 

      Apart from the sound of the flowing gas, a disturbing silence
      surrounds the subterranean passageways.

      Ben makes out "Anna's" silhouette, hiding behind the leaking gas      
      pipe.                                                                 

      With his bloodied face, Ben is no longer the same man anymore-        
      Something in his eyes has shifted. Rage and violence have             
      replaced the terror and dread. He is determined to put an end to      
      the creature, no matter what happens.                                 

      He slides the weapon in his belt and steps, with his bare hands,      
      towards what once was "Anna"...                                       

      Crouched over in the water, the demon looks up, ready to charge.      
      Ben takes another step forward with the same determination. The       
      creature thrusts itself against him-                                  

      THE CLASH IS EXTREMELY VIOLENT. Ben uses all his strength to          
      keep his assailant's jaw at a distance.                               

      In a swift movement, Ben turns around AND IMPALES "ANNA" ON THE       
      BROKEN GAS PIPE!                                                      

      IN A GUSH OF BLOOD THE SHARP METAL TIP PIERCES THROUGH HER            
      STOMACH BUT-                                                          

      Despite being momentarily immobilised, the demon seems                
      unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell. On       
      the contrary, it struggles more violently to escape from the          
      trap.                                                                 

      Ben moves away, keeping an eye on "Anna". He takes his gun and        
      aims it at her. Ben is exhausted. With his arm outstretched, he       
      is ready to shoot, waiting for the right moment.                      

      The silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark.                        

      Ben stands by-                                                        

      The demon goes through the cloud of gas- Ben fires-

      THE EXPLOSION IS INSTANTANEOUS. "ANNA" IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES.
      THE FIRE SPREADS THROUGH THE TUNNELS.

      Ben throws himself to the ground to avoid the flames.

      SUDDENLY, IN A DOMINO EFFECT, ONE EXPLOSION FOLLOWS THE OTHER. A
      BLAST OCCURS A BIT FURTHER DOWN THE TUNNEL, AND ANOTHER INSIDE
      THE WALLS.

      THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGEWAYS ARE ABOUT TO COLLAPSE-

      Cracks appear everywhere. The brick walls begin to fall apart.

      A part of the ceiling at the far end of the corridor caves in.

      Ben gets back on his feet and dashes for the stairs.

      Totally burnt, flesh charred, "Anna" is enraged by her prey's
      resistance. The blazing demon runs after Ben.

      Behind them, one after the other, sections of the walls
      collapse.

      Ben runs as fast as he can.

      "Anna" is coming closer to him, when suddenly -

      JUST BEHIND BEN, A SECTION OF THE GROUND FLOOR CAVES IN, BURYING
      HER UNDER A MASS OF RUBBLE.

      Ben narrowly escaped the collapse. He reaches the staircase and
      catches sight of the exit above when suddenly-

      THE ENTIRE FOUNDATION OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSES OVER HIM.

      Ben finds himself crushed along the floor and penetrates the         
      mirroring water surface DISAPPEARING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE        
      MIRROR.                                                              


129A INT. NIGHT - JERSEY HOUSE                                     129A    

      All of her efforts are in vain. Amy is unable to bring back her      
      son.                                                                 

      Nonetheless, she continues with the same determination, refusing     
      to accept reality.                                                   

      She finally breaks down, pleading with the sky above...              


129B THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR                                  129B    

      Lost and floating in this strange and unfamiliar place, Ben          
      turns and sees Michael's body/soul which is also trapped in this     
      parallel dimension, on the other side of the mirror.                 

      In the distance, he can see the surface leading to the hallway       
      of the New Jersey house. Above it, Amy tries to resuscitate          
      Michael.

      Ben grabs his son and holds him tightly in his arms for a          
      moment, then pushes him towards the surface-                       

      THE CHILD OPENS HIS EYES!-                                         


130   INT. NIGHT -NEW JERSEY HOUSE                                130    

      MICHAEL COMES AROUND, COUGHING OUT THE WATER FROM HIS LUNGS. Amy
      bursts into tears, sobbing with joy. She holds him tightly in
      her arms, with all her strength, with all her love.                

      Holding Michael in her arms, Amy comes back for Daisy in the
      bedroom. She opens the closet door and finds her little girl       
      inside. The child throws herself into her mother's arms-

                              DAISY
                  It is over, Mom?

      Amy throws a glance at her reflection in the mirror. Everything
      seems back to normal.

                              AMY
                  Yes sweetheart, it's over...

      Amy holds her two children tightly, savoring this moment of joy
      and relief.

      Through the window, we see the first light of dawn appearing on
      the horizon.


131   INT. DAWN - MAYFLOWER                                       131

      The sunbeams slice through the windowpanes of the glass dome
      above the entrance hall of the department store.

      The pigeons fly in and out...

      The burnt mannequins are still standing in the middle of the
      ruins.

      ON THE WALLS, ALL THAT REMAINS FROM THE MIRRORS IS THEIR 1920's    
      GOLD FRAMES.

      The floor has completely subsided. It looks like there was just
      an earthquake under the building.

      In the middle of the pile of debris, something in the rubble
      begins to move-

      A HAND APPEARS. SOMEBODY SURFACES -

      It's Ben. He gasps for air. Wounded and covered in dust, it is a   
      miracle that he has survived.

      He struggles back to his feet and climbs over the blocks of
      concrete to regain the ground floor.

      Limping, he crosses the entrance hall. His discovery of the
      absence of mirrors on the walls brings a smile to his face- He
      has finally triumphed over the mirrors that he once believed to
      be indestructible...


132   EXT. DAY - MAYFLOWER                                          132   

      Ben steps out of the department store, walks out of the closed      
      off area, and reaches the street.                                   

      Police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances with spinning lights       
      have surrounded the fencing.                                        

      Ben approaches the scene. He needs medical attention. He catches    
      sight of Lorenzo, talking to some policemen. Ben stops dead in      
      his tracks-                                                         

      THE NAME LORENZO, EMBROIDERED ON THE UNIFORM, IS WRITTEN            
      BACKWARDS...                                                        

      Ben glances at the police vehicles and their license plates-        

      How is it possible? EVERYTHING IS REVERSED.                         

      Ben steps back in panic.                                            

      As he walks away from the scene we discover something else in       
      the back of the ambulance-                                          

      ANNA'S CHARRED CADAVER, THAT HAS BEEN DUG OUT OF THE RUBBLE.

133   EXT. DAY - TIME SQUARE                                        133   

      Ben walks up west 38th Street to Broadway and stops at the          
      intersection of the streets, paralyzed with fear-                   

      The activity of Time Square seems normal for an early morning,      
      cars driving by and the eternal hustle and bustle of the            
      pedestrians, but ALL THE SIGNS, ALL THE BILLBOARDS ARE REVERSED.    
      AND SO IS THE DIRECTION OF THE TRAFFIC FLOW...                      

      Ben turns around towards a glass building where a homeless          
      person is sleeping-                                                 

      His eyes fill with horror-                                          

      HE CAN SEE THE REFLECTION OF THE HOMELESS MAN BUT NOT HIS OWN..

      Ben presses his hand against the glass. The reflection of the        
      world surrounding him is the right way around in the mirror but      
      he remains invisible.                                                

      He removes his hand from the mirror, leaving a clear and well-       
      defined handprint on the reflective surface.                         

      Ben slowly comes to realize what is happening to him -               

      IF HIS REFLECTION IS NOT THERE, IT MEANS THAT HE NO LONGER           
      BELONGS TO THE WORLD OF THE LIVING. BEN DID NOT SURVIVE-             

      HIS SOUL IS NOW A CAPTIVE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR...

      Back in the ambulance, a paramedic comes to close the back door.     

      The vehicle starts and leaves the Mayflower.                         


135   EXT. DAY - NEW-YORK - CONTINUITY                               135

      In the back of the ambulance, as the vehicle drives away, we         
      discover that another corpse is laid out next to Anna's-             

      IT'S BEN'S BODY, COVERED WITH DUST AND DRY BLOOD.                    

      Its fingers suddenly twitch...                                       

      Was it the bumpy road?                                               

      The dead fingers twitch again and-                                   

      IN THE SHADOW, BEN'S CORPSE SLOWLY BEGINS TO STAND.                  

      It turns its head-                                                   

      BEN'S EYES ARE ROLLED UPWARD, NO LONGER HUMAN...
