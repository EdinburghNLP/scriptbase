SUPERMAN IV

Revised 30th October, 1986

1     EARTH

Rolls into FRAME. A bauble of green and blue and white swirls of cloud cover. The eerie clip and whistle of cosmic rays is drowned out by static and someone singing 'MY WAY' - in Russian.

2     MOVING INTO FRAME  -  A SOVIET CAPSULE

Gleaming white. Black letters on its side, CCCP. A Russian COSMONAUGHT in his space suit is outside, repairing radio antenna. He's the one singing.

3     INSIDE THE CAPSULE

Three COSMONAUGHTS, two men and a woman, in gym shorts and red T-shirts, are busy floating to their stations. The CAPTAIN, teases his space walker.

                         CAPTAIN
                    (Russian with subtitles)
               Spare us the serenade, Comrade
                    Sinatra. You're not at home.

4     OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE

                         COSMONAUGHT
                             (subtitled)
                    At home my kids tell me to save my
                    singing for outer space...

5     RACING INTO VIEW

     A piece of spare debris! The discarded chunk of a failed satellite.

6     INSIDE THE CAPSULE

The COSMONAUGHTS notice the debris on its deadly course toward the COSMONAUGHT outside. Looks of consternation are exchanged.

7     OUTSIDE THE CAPSULE

     The COSMONAUGHT sees the debris moving toward him. He tries to react, moving first 
right then left.

8     CONTACT

     The debris hits the ship sending the COSMONAUGHT into space.

                         COSMONAUGHT
                              (Subtitled)
                    I'm lost! Goodbye!
9     THE CAPSULE

     Tumbles helplessly out of orbit, head over heels, out of control. The door hatch is clearly 
damaged.

10     INSIDE  -  THE CREW

Trying desperately to regain control of the ship. They are tossed about like clothes in a spin dryer.

11     SUDDENLY

     The spinning stops! The COSMONAUGHTS exchange startled looks.

                         CAPTAIN
                              (subtitled)
                    What the...

12     OUTSIDE

The SPACE SHIP moves slowly through the FRAME, now upright and in control, gliding through space.

13     TILT ANGLE  -  JUST BELOW  -  SUPERMAN!

     Carrying the SHIP gently.

14     CLOSE ON SUPERMAN

     His face shines with the same familiar resolve, the same steady strength, the same calm in the 
     heat of crisis the world expects. He turns and sees the lost COSMONAUGHT moving away 
in space.

15     SUPERMAN

     Flies off towards him.

16     BACK TO SPACE

     The COSMONAUGHT is losing consciousness.

17     P.O.V. -  MOVING TO THE COSMONAUGHT

     Something overtakes him. He stops tumbling! Through his helmet, we can see his      surprise. 
SUPERMAN carries the COSMONAUGHT to the capsule. He maneuvers the COSMONAUGHT to the airlock. Eases him through the hatch, then repairs the damaged door.

                    SUPERMAN
                       (in perfect Russian - subtitled)
               I think you'll be safer in here, Sir.

18     INSIDE THE CAPSULE

     The COSMONAUGHTS strain to look out their porthole. SUPERMAN slides by the 
window. The CREW clasps hands in thanks. SUPERMAN smiles humbly and then 
dives backward toward Earth.

ROLL OPENING CREDITS as . . . 

19     SUPERMAN HEADS FOR HOME

     Daylight comes with a new dawn from the east. SUPERMAN shoots over the horizon.

     (IMAX footage of Earth taken by the space shuttle.)

20     THE EARTH BELOW

     The warm sunlight highlights recognizable landmasses. This is home. Africa rolls
     slowly by. Then we see SUPERMAN float above Europe. Over the Atlantic, the ocean 
sparkles in shades of blue.

21     THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

     The continental states appear as precisely detailed as every map in every school room in 
     America. SUPERMAN hovers for a moment as if to admire the view. He arcs TOWARD us 
and then disappears below. 

CREDITS END

22     EXT. SMALLVILLE - THE KENT FARM - DAY

     The old wooden farmhouse is now weathered and shuttered. A 'FOR SALE' sign in front.

23     TWO HEADSTONES - GEORGE AND MARTHA KENT

     Fresh wildflowers adorn the graves.

24     CLARK KENT

     Shares a silent moment with the good people who raised him. Hands in his old jeans. Sleeves 
rolled up on his workshirt. He's for now just an orphan boy from the Midwest.

25     CLARK'S X-RAY VISION P.O.V.  -  FAR DOWN THE ROAD

He can see the dirt cloud of a car heading his way. CLARK turns and hurries toward the barn.

26     INT. THE BARN

     In the middle of the barn, CLARK has excavated a deep hole. He jumps out and hurries 
under the hayloft, reaching for...
     
27     A HAY-COVERED TARP

     CLARK brushes off the hay, removes the canvas cover.

28     PUSH IN TO REVEAL - KAL-EL'S ROCKET

     The metallic carcass of the space vessel that carried the young KAL-EL from KRYPTON to 
Earth.

29     CLARK DRAGS THE SHELL ACROSS THE BARN

     He maneuvers it deep into its new hiding place. 

30     CLOSEUP CLARK'S HAND BRUSHES INTERIOR OF THE SHIP

     A soot-covered CONTROL PANEL begins to glow with a soft GREEN LIGHT.

31     AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT

     Startled, CLARK crouches inside the space vessel. A VOICE, at first distorted, is familiar.

CLARK 
    (whispers)
Father!

Now we HEAR what is an old message from JOR-EL.

                              JOR-EL
                    by now Kal-El you are entering the 
                    atmosphere of the planet known as earth ...

CLARK is overwhelmed by JOR-EL'S voice.

                              CONTINUED
31     CONTINUED

JOR-EL (Cont.)
                    ... I pray you have made a safe journey. The 
yellow sun of your new home will give you 
great physical powers ... but it cannot console 
your spirit. Placed aboard this vessel is an energy 
module ... all that remains of a once powerful 
civilisation -- Krypton, your mother planet. It is 
my last gift to you. Once removed, the ship will 
grow cold and silent, and you will be finally 
alone. The power in the module can be used 
but once. Use it wisely . . . my son.
     
The message whirrs slowly down and is finally drowned in static. For a moment the vessel glows then fades out. CLARK reaches under the "dashboard'. and carefully retrieves the module.

32     A WHIRLWIND

Small, but strong, starts to envelop CLARK as he climbs from the ship. His hair blows as the wind and dust increase in intensity.

33     OUTSIDE THE PIT
     
CLARK reaches the top as the whir1wind peaks and then, as quickly as it appeared, it's gone. All is silent and calm.

34     THE BARN FLOOR

As the last of the dust settles' we see the pit has been filled in. CLARK, carefully crad1inq the module, stares, saying a final, silent farewell to his past, his childhood, his innocence.

35     OUTSIDE THE BARN - A CAR HORN BLARES 

CLARK quickly stashes the module under a tarp.

36     THE BARN

A big OLDS is parked by the barn door. LEVON HORNSBY, a grey-haired banker, is about to enter the barn.
               
                         HORNSBY
                    Clark! You in there?

CLARK pops out of the shadows.

                                                  CONTINUED
36     CONTINUED

CLARK
                    Hello, Mr. Hornsby. It's been a 
long time.

HORNSBY tries to peer over CLARK'S shoulder into barn. CLARK distracts him with a handshake.

CLARK(Cont.)
    (smiles)
I've just been tidying up for when 
you show the place.

HORNSBY 
     (slyly)
Didn't I mention that there was an offer 
to buy ... sight unseen?

CLARK 
(politely)
                    I'm sorry, but I don't want to sell the farm to 
a big developer. Whoever buys it has to want 
to keep a working farm. I don't think we need 
another shopping center.

HORNSBY frowns like he's heard it too many times. 

HORNSBY
                    Darn it, Clark Kent, why are you so stubborn? Today 
nobody wants a farm. Blink your eye and they'll all be 
gone. That's progress!

     HORNSBY catches CLARK off-guard and the barn. strolls into the barn.

CLARK 
                               (running after) 
Mr. Hornsby!

37     INSIDE THE BARN

HORNSBY 
      (spotting something) 
My, oh my! Look at this!

CLARK is relieved to see it's not the module, which barely protrudes from under the tarp but a baby's CRIB off to the side. Its wooden headboard has been cracked perfectly in two.

                                                  CONTINUED
37     CONTINUED

                         HORNSBY (Cont.)
       (laughs)
What a joker old George Kent was. 
       (fingering the crack)
I asked your dad what happened to the 
baby's crib.
         (mimics) 
"Oh, Clark must have kicked it."

CLARK
                    Dad liked a good joke.

HORNSBY indulges himself with a laugh. CLARK chuckles politely. But changes the subject. CLARK grabs an old mitt, a ball and a bat.

                    CLARK (Cont.)
               Maybe your grandchildren would like these, 
Mr. Hornsby.

     HORNSBY 
         (taking them) 
Hey, thanks, Clark.

CLARK ushers MR HORNSBY out of the barn.

38     BACK OUTSIDE

HORNSBY rolls the ball in his hand.

HORNSBY
Hey! Batter up!

He tosses CLARK the bat, then jogs several yards away. He makes a dramatic wind-up. 
CLARK sights, then assumes a batter's position. HORNSBY throws. For a minute CLARK 
looks like he'd love to take a mighty cut. Instead he misses completely.

                    HORNSBY
                       (remembering)
               Oh, yeah, you never could hit a
               curve ball.

CLARK 
       (polite, but resolute)
I think I'll hold out for a real farmer, Mr. 
Hornsby.

38     CONTINUED

                         HORNSBY
                           (walking back)
                    . . . and you were just as obstinate as your 
father.

     CLARK walks HORNSBY back to his car. HOLDS the door for him. 

HORNSBY 
                              (after he starts it up)
                    Be careful in that big City, Clark. You're a long, 
long way from where you were born.

CLARK
                    I never forget that, Sir.

HORNSBY guns his car and disappears down the road. CLARK smiles and picks up the ball and bat. A naughty young boy's smile creeps over his face. He throws up the ball, takes an easy swing. CRACK! The ball sails endlessly way, way, up into the sky.

39     A YOUNG CHILD

     Swaddled in red and blue cloth is carried through a smoky hall. Explosions thunder outside.

40     CHILD'S P.O.V.

The VOICES are distorted, the noises terrifying. The child is placed lovingly into a cradle-like capsule. Around him, bright flashes of fire. A glass canopy is gently lowered.

41     THE PLANET KRYPTON

     Against the blackness of space. Silent for a moment. The planet erupts in fire. Exploding in a 
hellish apocalypse. A streak of white escaping from the dying planet marks the child's rocket.

42     INT. CLARK KENT'S APARTMENT MORNING

     The ringing of the telephone blends with the roar of the dream.

43     AN ANSWERING MACHINE
 
Clicks on. CLARK'S voice on the tape. He was clearly uncomfortable when he recorded the 
message.

CLARK (V.O.)
                    Uh, Hi, this is Clark ... Kent. Please leave a 
message at the beep.

 BEEP
43     CONTINUED

LOIS (V.O.)
                    Clark ... it's Lois. I hope you're up. Perry wants 
us in the office on time. Something big is going 
on. . . Au Revoir.

     CLARK Jumps up and reaches for the phone.

CLARK
                    Hi, Lois. I'm up. Gee, I wonder what Perry's 
got in mind ...

It takes a moment for CLARK to realise that he is talking to himself. LOIS has clicked off and all that's left is the dial tone.

CLARK 
Oh well, bye Lois.

44     BREAKFAST TABLE  -  MINUTES LATER

CLARK rushes to pour a bowl of Wheaties, but realises too late the milk has turned sour. Now he scrambles for his briefcase. The radio is on.

                    D.J. (V.O. )
               And ... in the news, we have word that the East-West 
arms control talks have broken down. The President 
is scheduled to address the nation later ... and that is 
the good news - just kidding ...

     CLARK grabs his jacket, checks the time and flies out the door.


D.J. (Cont.) 
... so chin up, Metropolis! It's a typical Monday 
morning ... !

45     INT. SUBWAY STATION MORNING

      CLARK patiently filing slowly follows a long line of commuters through the turnstiles.

46     ON THE PLATFORM 

     A train has appeared. LOIS steps on board just as CLARK arrives on the platform. He calls 
after her.

CLARK
                    Lois!

She turns just as the doors close behind her. She points to her watch and gives CLARK a      disapproving look through the glass. The train pulls out, leaving CLARK.

47     CLOSE ON CLARK - X-RAY P.O.V. 

     CLARK squints slightly and follows the train into the tunnel, peering through the walls to see 

48     THE LEAD CAR

     An elderly ENGINEER sits before computerised controls. Suddenly, he clutches his heart.

ENGINEER
                    Oh, please. . .no. . . 

     He pitches forward unconscious. The train gathers speed.

49     ON THE PASSENGER CARS 

CLARK continues to scan with his X-RAY VISION. He sees LOIS, reading "FRENCH 
PHRASES FOR TRAVELLERS", unmindful, as are the other passengers, of the impending
disaster.

50     CLARK ON THE PLATFORM

Realising a disaster in the making, he moves out of sight and slips off his glasses. This is a job for ...

51     SUPERMAN!

He's off in a flash.

52     SUPERMAN'S P. O. V. - INTO THE TUNNEL

     Skimming just above the tracks, Superman tries to overtake the train.

53     SIDE ANGLE

As SUPERMAN begins to fly past the cars, "startled PASSENGERS spot him out the window. The relative speed of the train makes SUPERMAN seem to move in slow motion. LOIS looks up from her reading just in time to see SUPERMAN fly by. She runs to the window.

53     CONTINUED

LOIS
                    Superman!

     He turns his head just long enough to acknowledge her with a half-smile. He speeds ahead to 
meet the speeding subway. He stands calmly right in its path. The headlights grow larger and 
larger, bearing down on SUPERMAN! He takes one step back and purposely kicks his foot 
into the third rail!

54     CLOSE ON SUPERMAN

As an electric current roars through him. A blinding white-hot penumbra glows about him. He has become a human sun! Sparks shoot off like fireworks. The lights flash and go out. The electric current is shorted. One by one the green signal lights flash off. The out-of-control train is cut off from its energy source. In the ENGINEER'S booth the control lights flicker off. Inside the cars, the passengers stand in darkness as their train loses speed. Now SUPERMAN leaps behind the last car and, pulling gently, helps ease the train to a stop. In a flash, he's at the ENGINEER'S booth and flies the unconscious man onto the platform where a RESCUE SQUAD is just arriving.

SUPERMAN
                           (to the MEN)
                    I'll take this man to the hospital.

     As SUPERMAN leaves. 

55     LOIS IN WINDOW 

                         LOIS 
                                 (waving) 
Superman . . . thank you.

     From the look on her face, we know it all. SUPERMAN is the only man in her life who's 
super!

56     EXT. QUARRY -DAY

A stone quarry - a white scar on the landscape.

57     A PRISON CHAIN GANG

     Knee-deep in ooze, they shovel out debris near a track into the quarry. Overseeing the forlorn 
rednecks are TWO ~FEDERAL MARSHALS, toting rifles. A dumpy farm truck is parked on the shoulder.

Amendment No:   1   (pink)                                   Revised 05-Aug-86

58     PAN DOWN THE LINE OF CONVICTS

Most are shirtless in the heat, dripping sweat. A sunburnt inmate with Elvis sideburns is wailing a country lament. Most of the other MEN hum along.

59     AT THE END OF THE LINE 

     Suddenly we HEAR what sounds like classical music being whistled just loud enough to 
bother a CHUBBY CON. The con turns to the last man on the chain.

CON
                         What is that god-awful noise you're makin'?

60     THE LAST MAN ON THE CHAIN -- LEX LUTHOR !

The only man whose work clothes are still clean, still pressed, still fashionably accented with a tie. He merely leans on his shovel.

LEX
                    Mozart, my low-forehead friend. Even this 
wretched pit can't diminish the spirit of true 
genius ...I while you've been bending your 
back in this foul slime, I've been inspired! 
Life itself began in a murky pool much like 
this. And a genius such as myself learns to 
          seize the moment. You are the first to know 
that I now have a plan to recreate life itself!

LUTHOR expects awe. Instead, all he gets is a vacant stare as the CON squishes a huge 
mosquito.

ONE DEPUTY
                   (splashes water at LEX)
You better be breakin' a sweat, Luthor, or we'll 
feed you to the wolves!

61     THE TALL MARSHAL

Throws a stone by LEX, splashing him.

TALL GUARD
                    Hey Luthor, let's get those duds dirty.

Surrounded by Neanderthals!

The sound of an engine makes the FAT MARSHAL jump to his feet.

62.     A CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE

Driving down the middle of the track, screeches to a halt by the WORK CREW. Music blaring: from a: state-of-the-art wall-to-wall stereo system.

63     OUT OF THE CAR - A TEENAGE KID

Reeking of snotty sarcasm and bratty insults. He's dressed in a careful distillation of the worst effects of  punk and heavy metal. A Walkman permanently about his neck.

                    KID
                     (tapping the MARSHAL)
               Yo pops, where the hell is this and
               how do I get to Ft. Lauderdale?

The FAT MARSHAL shakes his head laughing and walks over to admire the CADILLAC and its sound system.

FAT MARSHAL
                    Son, you're on the wrong side of the State.
(touching the CADILLAC)
You got yourself one heck of a sound there, 
son.

The TALL MARSHAL has wandered over to investigate.

                    KID
               I guess you yo-yo's have never seen
               one of theses Sensearound 100's.

                    TALL MARSHALL
                         (defensive)

               Once.

The KID takes a contemptuous look over the CHAIN GANG.

KID
        (big, friendly smile
         to the MARSHALS)
Go on, get in. Only way to hear it.

He opens the door to the CADDIE. The MARSHALS exchange naughty grins and slip inside. The FAT MARSHAL tweaks the controls and the music gets louder.

FAT MARSHAL
                    Hot dog!

                         TALL MARSHAL
                    Amen.

64     ON THE KID     

His smile disappears. He steps back. He slips his WALKMAN from around his neck.

65     CLOSE ON THE WALKMAN

As the KID turns it over to REVEAL a REMOTE CONTROL UNIT. He quickly punches in 
orders. . .

66     ON THE CADILLAC

The top quickly closes down and locks. Startled, the TWO MARSHALS are frozen by 
confusion. The car door locks click shut. Engine starts. Windows up. All in a flash.

FAT MARSHAL 
      (yells through window) 
What's going on?

     The KID hits another button and ...

67     THE CADILLAC ROARS OFF

     Under its own control. The MARSHALS stare hopelessly as the WHEEL TURNS ITSELF.

68     MARSHALS' P. O.V. - STRAIGHT AHEAD - OVER THE EDGE

     A sheer drop to the quarry floor. The KID increases the speed and OVER THE EDGE INTO 
THE QUARRY and EXPLODES. The KID turns and scrambles until he finds LUTHOR.

LEX
                    Lenny, I've always thought of you as the 
Dutch elm disease of my family tree. But 
this time, nephew, you did fine.

LENNY starts cutting the chains from LEX.

70     THE PRISONERS

Still bound one to the other by long chains, look on with envy. The one CON calls out LEX.

CON
                    How 'bout givin' us a break too, Mr. 
Mozart?

LEX 
        (aghast)
Just because I use my genius in criminal 
ways. . . doesn't mean I'm not a firm believer 
in law and order. You men belong in prison!

LENNY finishes cutting LEX free.

LENNY
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?

LEX 
       (rubbing his wrists)
Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school 
system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on 
his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . 
Destroying Superman!

70A     THE TWO MARSHALS

Scramble from the wrecked CADILLAC.

71     INT. ELEVATOR - DAILY PLANET BUILDING  -  MORNING

     The doors open and CLARK rushes off. It's odd, but the hallway is surprisingly empty.

Amendment No: 1  (pink)                                   Revised 05-Aug-86

72     INT. CITY ROOM  -  MORNING

The cavernous sprawl of desks and word processors. CLARK runs in and freezes. Every desk 
is empty. Not a soul is stirring. Not even a copy boy.

PERRY  (O.S.)
                    You're late, Kent!

CLARK turns around in time to see PERRY WHITE march past the door. The editor-in-chief 
stops just long enough to scowl at CLARK.

73     DOWN THE HALLWAY

CLARK catches up with PERRY.

CLARK
                    Right, sir. I promise it won't happen 
again.

     Now PERRY WHITE stops dead in his tracks. Face to face with CLARK.

                         PERRY
                    Ha!

PERRY shakes his head and disappears into the conference room.

                               (a step behind)
                    But where is . . .

74     INTO THE CONFERENCE ROOM

     CLARK
. . . everybody?

Everybody is crammed at one end of the long table in the newspaper's strategy chamber. 
JIMMYOLSEN and LOIS LANE flank PERRY WHITE as he sits. All the other 
REPORTERS, EDITORS and STAFF are there.

75     THE OTHER END OF THE TABLE  -  DAVID WARFIELD

Impeccably dressed with a folded pocket handkerchief, the aristocratic tycoon slips      contemptuously through the morning edition of THE DAILY PLANET. Behind him are a 
few unctuous CRONIES.

76     A STYLISH YOUNG WOMAN

Sits on WARFIELD'S RIGHT. She's in her mid-20's with a natural beauty carefully moulded  to fit VOGUE.

                    WARFIELD 
    (as he turn. the page.) 
Boring ... tedious ... abominable ... enough!
 
77     CLARK SLIDES BEHIND LOIS

CLARK
                    What's everybody doing here?

LOIS

                    Voila Monsieur David Warfield.

CLARK
                    That tycoon who owns all those sleazy 
tabloids?

LOIS
                    Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy 
tabloids and the Daily Planet!

WARFIELD and PERRY WHITE are squared off like two frontier gamblers.

                    PERRY
               Don't tell me. You only read the pictures.

                    WARFIELD
               In fact, Mr. White, I only read the ledger.
               A ledger which the previous owners paid 
so little attention to that I was able to buy 
the paper out from under them. The Daily 
Planet hasn't made money in three years.

     Now the lovely girl smiles. She speaks with a clenched-teeth, upper-crust intonation.

GIRL
                    And the name of the game is making 
money.

Warfield!

     As his politeness dictates, CLARK steps forward.

CLARK
                    Nice to make your acquaintance.

LACY just stares at CLARK'S outstretched hand. He pushes his glasses up, smiles and steps 
back.

LOIS 
       (whispers to CLARK)
She made her money the old fashioned-way. 
She inherited it.

     WARFIELD
Lacy will be helping you, Mr. White.

                         PERRY
                    Helping me?

                         JIMMY 
     (to LOIS and CLARK)
Here it comes. Get ready to tie down the 
chief.

     LACY
Once upon a time The Daily Planet was a 
nice paper. Now it's ... fatigued. I've brought 
with me mock copies of our new layout.

She holds up a tabloid-sized paper with a giant headline screaming:  'SUMMIT KAPUT! IS 
WORLD AT BRINK?'  Underneath is a picture of a model in a bikini with her hands folded 
in prayer.

CLARK
                    Sir, the world isn't really at the brink. Isn't 
that headline, a bit irresponsible?

WARFIELD
                    Maybe. But it's a hell of a circulation 
booster.

     PERRY'S face turns various shades of magenta. He rises slowly.

                         CLARK
                    Mr. White, don't do anything rash.

PERRY

                    Rash? There's the rash that infects world  
journalism. If you think I'm going to let you 
turn this grand old lady into one of your 
bimbos . . .

     LACY holds up a sheath of papers.

                         LACY
                    Before your dramatic stage exit, Mr. White, 
may I point out that daddy holds your contracts. 
Which  you will have to honor.

LOIS steps forward, hand raised.

LOIS
                    Excusez Moi, Your Spoiledness . . .

     CLARK nudges JIMMY.

CLARK

Why is Lois speaking French?

                         JIMMY
                    She's getting to that part.

LOIS
                    . . . I've got a plane to catch. I'm covering the 
emergency European ministers' conference in 
Paris.

She starts to leave. LACY stands.

     WARFIELD parades out with his entourage. PERRY looks like he's being taken to the tower. 
LOIS is stunned. The rest of the staff shuffles out drearily in the B.G.

                    CLARK 
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. 
And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.

     LOIS

Clark . . . wait!

     CLARK intercepts LACY WARFIELD before she can exit.

                    Miss Warfield, I think I speak for all of us when I say 
we'll do our best to co-operate. But a reporter's first 
allegiance is to the truth. The people in this city
depend on us. And we can't let them down! . . . 
Thank you.

     CLARK shakes her hand and leaves the room. LOIS folds her arms with a look to LACY that

Joining CLARK, PERRY WHITE and JIMMY OLSEN in WARFIELD'S office, who has turned on the TV

                    CLARK
               The President is about to speak. I don't think 
it's going to be good news.

     LOIS
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can 
it be?

79     CLOSE ON CLARK

     Obviously trying to evaluate the situation.

WARFIELD

     The TV is turned off.

A young woman TEACHER faces her class. 

83     INT. JFK HIGH SCHOOL  -  DAY

     A middle-class sunbelt school.

84     CLASSROOM  -  DAY

     A history class with twenty l6-year-olds. All eyes on the TEACHER in front of a world map. 
All eyes that is, but the eyes of a kid in the last seat of the last row. JEREMY is a confirmed 
daydreamer in faded denim. His eyes are staring out the window. His mind is wandering 
even farther.

TEACHER
                    I know you're all upset by the crisis. The best thing 
we can do is try to think positively. Is there anything 
we can do?

     ONE BOY
Yeah, let's hold class in a bomb shelter. Maybe some 
of us would make it to our senior prom.

     Nervous laughter from the kids.

                         TEACHER
                    Come on, doesn't anyone have a suggestion?

     The kids sit in silence.

TEACHER (Cont.)
All right, I'll make a suggestion. Why don't we write 
to our Congressman?

ANOTHER BOY
                    A lotta good that would do.

The kids chime in their agreement with the boy's comment. Nervous laughter from the kids.

85     CLOSE ON JEREMY'S DESK

     He's doodling. A picture of SUPERMAN flying.

General laughter at Jeremy's expense. The TEACHER sighs. She didn't expect much. JEREMY, the dreamer, blushes. Now he's thinking.

TEACHER 
Anyone else ...

     JEREMY looks out the window to the blue sky. Then he stands up. Surprised at himself.

                         JEREMY

all. the bombs. Zap!. They're history.

Defiantly, JEREMY sits down and takes out a pen and paper. Even as the laughter echoes 
around him, he starts to write.

'Dear Superman . . . '

His chiseled features stare off into the distance as if he just heard a cry for help.

Their heads only come up to the top of SUPERMAN'S red boots. We PULL BACK to 
REVEAL . . .

88     INT. METROPOLIS MUSEUM  -  DAY

     The PEOPLE are tourists looking at . . . 

89     A LARGER THAN LIFE STATUE OF SUPERMAN 

A permanent exhibit surrounded by photos of SUPERMAN in action, memorabilia and 
illustrated facts and figures about the Man of Steel.

90     MOVING FROM ANOTHER WING OF THE MUSEUM

A young Vietnamese-American tour GUIDE is pointing out things to a GROUP TOUR of
about twenty people.

GUIDE
                    Okay, let's move on to our newest and 
most popular exhibit.

91     THE SUPERMAN EXHIBIT

The TOUR GROUP forms a semicircle around the statue. At the back of the GROUP -- what 
seems to be a FATHER and SON -- both wear dark glasses and baseball caps.

92     CLOSE ON  -  A GLOBE OF THE EARTH

     Made out of solid steel. Branded on it is its weight: lOOO lbs. It hangs suspended by a long 
thin strand of what seems to be black wire, attached to a crossbeam. All protected by a glass 
case.

GUIDE
      (pointing it out)
Superman has graciously donated a strand of 
His hair to the museum. So we all could have 
the fun of seeing how strong he really is.
Here you can see a 1000-pound globe easily 
suspended by his single hair.

Oohs and aahs from the GROUP.

GUIDE (Cont.)
                    Now let's move on to our primate exhibit.

93     THE GROUP LEAVES

     But not the 'father' and 'son.' Once the pitter patter of feet on the linoleum floor fades, the 
'father' takes off his hat and glasses. We see his bald pate. It's LEX LUTHOR.  He saddles 
right up to the statue.

LEX 
     (addressing the statue) 
Guess who! . . . Of course it's me! Your old buddy! 
Lex Luthor . . . Hey, you don't look too bad yourself. 
'Course I've put on a few pounds, but what the hey! 
They feed you a lot of starch when you've in prison.
       (his Jokey tone becomes 
        more deadly)
That was 'prison' . . . as in where you put me, Mr. Clean. 
Say, we should get together soon. Over lunch, over 
dinner, or ... over your dead body.

94     ON LENNY

     He's standing by the glass case containing SUPERMAN'S hair. He slips an iron MALLET 
out of his jacket. Throws off his baseball cap to REVEAL his buzzcut hair with purple 
highlights.

LEX
                           (to LENNY)
                    Do you realize what I can create with a single
strand of Superman's hair!

     LENNY 
        (thinking hard) 
A toupee that flies?

     LEX 
        (sighs)
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans 
felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.

     LENNY 
But why the hair?

     LEX 
       (gazes into the case)
That hair contains a sample of Superman's genetic 
material. The building blocks of his body. With 
my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate 
those genes, I will create a being with all his powers . . .
 but with absolute allegiance to me!

     LEX nods at  LENNY. LENNY raises the iron mallet above the case. CRASH. Alarms 
SOUND all over the museum. As LEX reaches for the hair, LENNY lights several SMOKE BOMBS and tosses them down the wind. In moments the SMOKE begins to bellow, creating a shroud around LEX and LENNY.
     
                    LEX (Cont.) 
      (to the statue)
Happy trails, Blue Boy, until we meet again.

99     IN THE CLASSROOM  -  JEREMY

     Still daydreaming, eyes fixed outside. 

100     JEREMY'S P.O.V.

     Suddenly, SUPERMAN seems to be hovering in the air just outside the window.  He smiles 
at JEREMY.

JEREMY 
                             (leaping to his feet)
                    Whoa!

                         TEACHER
                    Jeremy! Do you have a question?

                                                       CONTINUED

100     CONTINUED

JEREMY looks outside, SUPERMAN is gone.

JEREMY
                    I thought ... I ...I was just daydreaming.

The CLASS laughs. JEREMY slumps down. A beat, then there's a KNOCK at the door. All heads turn.

101     INTO THE ROOM  -  SUPERMAN

     He's carrying JEREMY'S letter. Walks down the aisle.

                         SUPERMAN
                          (to the TEACHER)
                    I'm sorry to interrupt your lesson, but I wanted 
to answer Jeremy in person.

     Heads turn to JEREMY. Ridicule replaced by awe.

                         TEACHER 
      (finding her tongue)
Class ... we have a guest speaker. A friend of . . . 
Jeremy's.

JEREMY is beaming. New-found friends slap "five" with him.

                    SUPERMAN
               This is the most important letter I've ever received, 
Jeremy. But I'm afraid what you're asking is . . . 
impossible.

     JEREMY is stunned.

JEREMY 
                    Impossible? Why?

                         SUPERMAN
                    Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny 
of your planet.

                                   CONTINUED

101     CONTINUED

     JEREMY
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown 
away?  What good was my letter? 

SUPERMAN
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of 
the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not 
I, that represent the people of Earth.

102     PAN THE ROOM

Twenty confused faces. JEREMY looks crushed.

                    TEACHER 
         (gently) 
I'm sure we all want to thank Superman for taking 
the time to visit us.
                               (to SUPERMAN)
                    Thank you.  We understand.

     SUPERMAN takes a long walk back down the aisle.

JEREMY 
        (just before SUPERMAN 
          is at the door) 
Well, I don't understand.

     SUPERMAN
I'm sorry.

     SUPERMAN turns. JEREMY looks right at him. His eyes are the color of disappointment. 
One of his classmates sniggers at JEREMY.

                    CLASSMATE
               Told you so!

103     INT. LEX'S LAIR

     One wall of LEX'S laboratory is a COMPUTER BANK marked by digital readouts and heat 
calibrations.

104     NUCLEAR CHAMBER

     A translucent glass door, much like a PRISM, glowing as it turns through all the colors of 
the light spectrum.

105     EXTREME CLOSEUP - LEX

A look on his face we've never seen before. He has even amazed himself.

LEX 
         (softly)
I am ... smarter than I thought. It's working!
          (turns to LENNY)
Quick, Lenny. Prepare the Nuclear Chamber . . . 
Lenny?
           (no answer)
Lenny! . . .
           (screams)
LEONARD!

106     THE LAB  -  LENNY

     With his WALKMAN over his ears, he's beating against the air with two drumsticks. LEX 
scowls and FLICKS LENNY'S earphones. LENNY yowls. 

LEX 
      (threatening) 
Get the radiation suits!

     LENNY brings out two WHITE WORK SUITS. He and LEX dress quickly.

107     LIGHTS GO DOWN IN THE LABORATORY

Only the prismatic glow from the chamber illuminates the room in blues, golds and greens.
 LEX carries a glass petri dish. His hands protected by aluminum gloves.

108     TIGHT ON THE DISH 

A seething dash of protoplasm seems to grow right before our eyes. LEX slides the dish into 
the chamber. Closes the door. Locks it tight.

                    LEX
               Every day the earth is bombarded by 
radioactive cosmic rays. Over millions 
of years, the radiation made single cells 
evolve into . . . us. Now, Leonard, your 
Uncle Lex, using this protoplasm I've grown 
from Superman's cells, will duplicate Creation 
itself in a matter of seconds!

109     CLOSE ON LEX'S HAND

     As it hits a sequence of computer commands.

110     PUSH IN SLOWLY  -  TO THE NUCLEAR CHAMBER 

     The reaction begins. The lights flash, building and building until. . . a monstrous ROAR! An 
almost human voice screams. LEX shuts off the reaction. He and LENNY tear off their 
protective headgear.

                         LENNY 
        (scared) 
What was that?

     LEX reacts. Listens.

                         LEX
                    It's . . . alive!

     Another ROAR from the bowels of the chambers. LEX  punches the door lock. The door 
slides open.

                    LEX (Cont.)
 Now . . . watch how he obeys my commands . . .
        (calls out)
. . . Come on, big boy!

111     ANGLE  -  THE OPEN DOOR

We HEAR the sound of heavy FOOTSTEPS. LENNY glues himself behind LEX, peeking 
around his uncle.

112     SOUND: CRASH!   THROUGH THE LAB WALL  -  THE NUCLEAR MAN

     Concrete and debris fall everywhere.

                         LENNY
                    He missed the door, Uncle Lex.

LEX
                    Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.

113     CLOSE ON  -  THE NUCLEAR MAN

     LEX'S monster appears to be a huge young man with long arms and a long neck. The beast
spots LEX and slowly reaches its arms toward him. Opens his mouth. The sound that comes 
out is hideous and barely comprehensible.

                    NUCLEAR MAN 
F-f-f-f-faaather. . . !
          
                                                  CONTINUED

113     CONTINUED

     LENNY steps around LEX, walks up to the beast. 

LENNY
He called you father. What a . . . moron! He needs 
something to wear too, Uncle Lex. Unless you want 
to let him out looking like this!

LEX looks over to NUCLEAR MAN and realizes he's naked. LEX grabs a pair of workmen's 
coveralls from a hook on the wall and tosses it to NUCLEAR MAN. NUCLEAR MAN grabs 
it, confused.

                         NUCLEAR MAN 
What I need this for?

     LEX
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.

     LEX picks up a solid IRON INGOT. He hands it to the MONSTER.

                         LEX
                    Now break it!

The NUCLEAR MAN hesitates, then he SNAPS the ingot in two.

LENNY
                    Whoa. . .

                         LEX
                    He has all of Superman's powers. If I've 
planned it right. . . 

     Now LEX takes a MACHINE GUN out and aims it at the BEAST. 

                         LEX (Cont.)
                     Stand back, Lenny!

114     LEX FIRES

     The bullets smack into the NUCLEAR MAN. He seems confused. But he hardly flinches.

                                                  CONTINUED

114     CONTINUED

                         LEX 
        (a big grin) 
Very good. Now. . . the final test . . . let's see if 
he can fly. . . I command you to rise.

The NUCLEAR MAN turns his head in confusion, wrinkles his brow. 

Then he rises ... too quickly.

115     HE CRASHES INTO THE CEILING

     And plummets in a heap to the floor. Plaster and sprinkles down. LEX and LENNY run to 
lift him up.

                    LEX
               Okay, okay, he needs a little coaching.

An idea dawns on LEX.

                    LEX (Cont.)
               Lenny, hand me the Daily Planet. It's time for 
Metropolis to get a taste of my Nuclear Man.

     LENNY gives LEX the paper. He flips through it.

                         LEX
                    I don't 'know what this country's coming to. This 
used to be a fine paper -- Aha, here.

116     INSERT -  THE NEWSPAPER

     A picture of a new night club. Headline reads: GRAND OPENING OF CHIC NIGHT SPOT 
TONIGHT! A WHO'S WHO OF METROPOLIS TO ATTEND!

                    LENNY
               Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much 
of a dancer.

                                   CONTINUED

116     CONTINUED

     LEX
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard.
Before we launch him against Superman, we have to 
test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and
destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the 
glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And 
once he proves himself, then . . .

     LEX walks up to his creation. Stands face to face. The expression on the beast's face is 
something in between confusion and fury. The coverall hangs awkwardly from his frame.

LEX holds up a PHOTO OF SUPERMAN.

LEX (Cont.)
                    I created you for one reason only ... to destroy this 
man.

117     CLOSE ON THE NUCLEAR MAN

     He smiles as best as his wretched muscles will allow. It's almost a childlike smile.

NUCLEAR MAN 
Yes . . . f-f-faaather. . . 

118     BEAMS OF SEARCH LIGHTS

     Criss-crossed in a basked weave against the Metropolis night. For a moment, we see a quick 
flash of SUPERMAN, then he disappears.

119     EXT. THE METRO CLUB - NIGHT

     An endless line of supplicants wait humbly to see if they'll be admitted into the latest court of 
chic.

120     CLOSEUP LACY               

Waiting outside, pacing and looking at her watch. CLARK runs up to her. 

LACY
You're late. Very late.

     CLARK
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.

     LACY
Oh, Clark, you're so delightfully primitive.

121     THE METRO CLUB - FRONT DOOR

     Two beefy BOUNCERS stand side by side,. barring the way. A young COUPLE, hand-in-
hand, are trying to peek inside.

                    YOUNG GUY
               See, it's our honeymoon and we just wanted
to have one dance here.

     YOUNG GIRL
So I can tell everyone back home. Please? 
One dance?

     CLARK and LACY are behind them. The BOUNCER spots LACY and pushes the COUPLE 
out of the way.

BOUNCER
                    Good evening, Miss Warfield.

     He scowls at CLARK.

                         CLARK 
I'm with . . . her.
     
He hurries inside after LUCY.

122     INT. METRO CLUB

     Loud, packed, glitzy --  sensory overload. 

123     BACK TO CLARK AND LACY

She guides him through the frenzy. They have to talk loudly to hear each other.

CLARK 
        (being polite)
I've never been in a place like this before.

     LACY
This is Metropolis after hours! This is what you'll be 
writing about. C'mon, let's dance.

Forcing their way onto the dance floor, they start dancing. But it's so crowded, CLARK is      bumped and jostled incessantly. As is everyone else. But CLARK is the only one who stops      and says, 'Excuse me' every single time.

                                                  CONTINUED

                             (he stops dancing) 
They get the idea.

     Now a Don Johnson surrogate cuts in on CLARK. CLARK backs away sheepishly.

124     EXT. METRO CLUB - FRONT DOORS

     CLARK squeezes between the TWO BOUNCERS.

                         CLARK
                    Be right back. Need some fresh air.

The BOUNCERS just shrug. CLARK looks up and down the block. He spots the young 
COUPLE standing forlornly at the end of the long line. CLARK walks calmly the other way 
until he turns the corner. Takes a deep breath ... and then ...

125     EFFECTS: ZOOM! ONE LONG BLUR AS WE TRACK CLARK 

     Around the block, speeding beyond human perception.

126     THE END OF THE LINE  -  THE YOUNG COUPLE 

They are there. And then they are not.

127     EXT. METRO CLUB  -  FRONT DOOR 

     The TWO BOUNCERS lean against either side. They only feel a sudden shot of air.

128     INT. METRO CLUB     -  ON THE DANCE FLOOR

The YOUNG COUPLE suddenly find themselves right in the middle of their dream. They're 
too stunned to move. CLARK acts as if he was just passing by. He leans over.

CLARK
                    I believe you're supposed to dance.

     The nod and start dancing.

     LACY      Obviously unhappy with the Don Johnson clone. Now the music changes. It's 
romantic and bluesy. The floor empties out except for a few couples. Including the out-of-
towners.

130     CLARK CUTS BACK IN

                         CLARK
                    Remember me?

CLARK takes her hand. 

CLARK (Cont.) 
I think this goes here.

     He puts her hand on his shoulder. They dance in the ballroom position.

                         LACY
                    Don't tell me. You learned to dance at church socials.

CLARK
                    Actually, I had a crash course from my mother the 
night before my prom.

     CLARK and LACY dance the old-fashioned way.

LACY
                    My prom was so boring. We all flew to Paris the 
next day to recover . . . Sometimes my whole life 
seems boring. I thing maybe I should just give 
everything away and go live among the poor people. 
Then I remember how smashing I look in sable . . . 
oh, it's all so confusing. You think I'm silly, don't you?

CLARK
                    No ... Metropolis is a confusing place. Back in 
Smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more 
simple. People would sacrifice everything just to lend 
a helping hand.

LACY
                    That's not what we were taught. 'Look out for number 
one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up 
with the gold.

     The out-of-town YOUNG COUPLE is dancing with their eyes closed. They BUMP into 
CLARK, shoving him closer to LACY. A moment of intimacy, then . . .

LACY (Cont.)
                    I bet you have some freckle-faced, pig-tailed girl 
named Billy Jean waiting for you in Smallville.

CLARK 
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.

LACY 
                    What about here?

                         CLARK
                    Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.

LACY
                    Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to 
strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered 
species.

     CLARK
That sounds kind of pessimistic.

     LACY
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls 
just don't get swept off their feet anymore.

     She is sincere and CLARK is obviously touched by her sadness.

131     ANGLE - GROUND LEVEL

CLARK and LACY, toe to toe, a forest of dancing feet around them. And then, ever so 
slightly, LACY'S shoes LEAVE THE GROUND WITH CLARK. Just an inch above -- but 
they are nevertheless dancing on air.

132     CLOSE ON LACY

Closes eyes for a moment. Then shakes her head.

LACY
                    I feel kind of light-headed . . .

                         CLARK 
         (gently) 
Don't worry, I've got you.

133     EXT. FRONT DOOR  -   THE TWO BOUNCERS 

     Standing at the door is the NUCLEAR MAN. He's dressed in what can only be called a 
psychotic version of hip. His hair has been stood up on end.  

ONE BOUNCER 
You got a pass, Mister?

     NUCLEAR MAN 
          (smiles)
N-n-n-no . . .

     The other BOUNCER gives him a little shove. 

SECOND BOUNCER
               Then scram, before you scare away the customers.

     The NUCLEAR MAN looks down at where the BOUNCER shoved him. Then he reaches 
out and lifts both  BOUNCERS   by their necks. We can HEAR the cracking of bones. With 
ease, the MONSTER THROWS THE BOUNCERS . . . WHOOSH! The two BODIES crash 
land in a dumpster behind the club.

134     INSIDE THE METRO CLUB

     LEX'S CREATURE is dazzled by the lights. The CLUB DJ hits the STROBE LIGHTS 
turning all the guests into pulsing images. The NUCLEAR MAN bumps into dancers, knocks 
over drinks, collides with waitresses, upending their trays. A walking disaster zone.

135     A HIP GUY 

Carrying two drinks has them knocked out of his hands by the MONSTER. He turns and      throws a punch at the BEAST. The NUCLEAR MAN catches his fist. CRUNCH!  He      crushes it.

136     BY A PILLAR

     The NUCLEAR MAN holds on and switches to his X-RAY VISION.

Scanning the crowd until he sweeps by. . .

138     NUCLEAR MAN'S P.O.V.  -  CLARK AND LACY 

     Dancing, having a delightful time.

139     CONINUED

     CLOSE ON HIS FACE - the loathsome CREATURE experiences something he doesn't quite 
understand. But zing go the strings of his prefab heart. He's transfixed on LACY.

                    WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Hey, cutie, let's boogie.

The NUCLEAR MAN turns to see an over-the-hill WOMAN, completely sauced, squeezed 
into spandex pants, flirting.

WOMAN
                    I like the rugged type.

     She slips her arm around him. Whispers in his ear.

                         WOMAN (Cont.)
                    You with anyone?
                           (as he doesn't respond)
                    Come on, big boy. Let's slip away to 
my place.

     Thoroughly confused, he watches as she takes his big hand and pulls him out of the club.

140     EXT. THE METRO CLUB  -  NIGHT

     The NUCLEAR MAN and the drunken woman weave through the CROWD. She yanks him 
along into the alleyway that runs beside the club.

141     IN THE ALLEYWAY  -  NIGHT

     LOVERS in silhouette. She stumbles up against him and undoes his shirt.

142     ON HIS CHEST

     Thoroughly repulsive, crackling and smoking. The WOMAN screams.

143     INT. CLUB DANCE FLOOR  -  CLARK AND LACY 

     LACY is trying to figure out how CLARK feels about her.

LACY
                    I know a romantic spot we can go for a nightcap. 
I'II go get my purse. Don't disappear!

Using his SUPERHEARING, he detects the distant SCREAM. With difficulty, he disengages himself from LACY, hurries off the floor and re-emerges as SUPERMAN.

145     EXT. ALLEYWAY -  NIGHT

     SUPERMAN rounds the corner as the WOMAN runs past and he sees:

146     THE NUCLEAR MAN

     Standing at the far end of the alley - near the parking lot.

147     CLOSER ON NUCLEAR MAN

     He throws a huge garbage skip, which catches SUPERMAN unawares and knocks him 
down.
     
     SUPERMAN pushes the skip aside and pursues NUCLEAR MAN round the corner.

148     CLOSE ON SUPERMAN

     NUCLEAR MAN'S fist thumps him in the mouth: Caught unawares again.

149     EXT. CAR PARK -  NIGHT

     A massive fight ensues among the parked cars until finally

150     ON THE SIDEWALK

NUCLEAR MAN wrenches a lamppost from the sidewalk and brings it down onto SUPERMAN, who effortlessly catches the other end, swings it violently round and round and lets go.

NUCLEAR MAN sails through the air.

     He looks up at the wreckage of the electricity pole and down at the smoking ash all that is 
left of NUCLEAR MAN

154     INT. LEX'S LAIR  -  NIGHT

     LEX watches in disgust as LENNY carries the remnants of the monster into the laboratory.

155     CLOSE ON THE REMNANTS

     The last traces of NUCLEAR MAN. Or at least what was once the NUCLEAR MAN.

                         LEX
                    I must have miscalculated. How. . .

LEX flops into a big leather chair. Rubs his eyes.

                    LEX (cont.)
               Obviously normal radiation doesn't generate enough 
mutant power in the cells. I need a greater source of 
energy! If I could bake the genetic. material in the 
core of the sun . . .
        (a moment of excitement,
         then he sits back)
. . . Impossible. Even I have no way to reach the sun.

156     CLOSE ON THE ASH

     The still smoking evidence of LEX'S mistake.

158     BACKSEAT  -  WARFIELD AND LACY

WARFIELD
                         (pats her hand)
                    Bringing the kid who wrote the letter to 
Metropolis will be our greatest publicity 
gimmick. And it was your idea! Perhaps it's
time to discuss giving you free reign at one 
of my papers . . . Miss Publisher!

     WARFIELD expects a big reaction. But LACY is staring out the window, something else' on 
her mind. Mumbles aloud.

                    LACY
               Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He 
never even said good night!

     WARFIELD
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . 
reporter!

LACY 
        (snapping to: she's 
         said too much)
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . .  
for  a story . . .

     WARFIELD
         (a lecture)
Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me 
well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your 
own station. Am I clear?

     LACY nods, chastised.

159     EXT. METROPOLIS AIRPORT  -  DAY

A private jet landing. On the side: Warfield Publications.

160     EXT . THE JET PARKED  -  STAIRS AT THE DOOR

     A crowd of REPORTERS has gathered. The door opens and JEREMY descends the stairs. 
Waiting below for him is WARFIELD. A bank of microphones has been set by a podium. 
WARFIELD ushers the scared BOY up to the crowd. He lets the PHOTOGRAPHERS get a 
few shots in, then steps to the mike.

WARFIELD
                    Go ahead son. Tell the American public what 
you told me.

     JEREMY 
        (softly) 
I just said . . .

     SNAP!  He's distracted by the PHOTOGRAPHERS.

                         JEREMY (Cont.)
                    . . . I just said I wished Superman would have 
said 'yes' . . .

LOIS (V.O.) 
This time he's gone too far.

163     INT. CITY ROOM  -  DAY

JIMMY,  LOIS, and CLARK are staring at the latest edition. CLARK is heartbroken.  PERRY charges through. He looks more well turned-out than we have ever seen him double-breasted pinstripe suit. He carries the papers under his arm.

                    PERRY
               I'm through taking it lying down.

He storms out. Stops. Sticks his head back in.

                    PERRY (Cont.)
               If anybody wants me .I'll be down town.

Then he's gone.

               He looked like my Dad did every time he 
went to the bank to try and borrow money.

     She notices CLARK staring intently at the headline. She crosses to him.

LOIS (Cont.)
                    Clark, there's nothing any of us can do. It's 
Superman's decision. I'm sure he knows what 
he's doing.
     
     CLARK takes the paper and eyes fixed on the headline, walks out of the city room.

164     INT. DAILY PLANET HALLWAY  -  DAY

     CLARK is walking one way when WARFIELD and his cronies come the other way - 
escorting JEREMY. He seems bewildered by it all.

165     CLARK AND JEREMY PASS EACH OTHER

     After a few steps, they both stop. JEREMY turns to look back at CLARK. CLARK offers a 
smile. WARFIELD and his entourage pass on around the corner.

JEREMY approaches CLARK.

                         JEREMY 
       (curiously)
Do I know you?

     CLARK 
        (a beat, then)
I'm Clark Kent, one of the staff reporters.

     JEREMY 
      (whispers nervously) 
Do you know Superman ?

     CLARK adjusts glasses, puts his hands in his pockets.

CLARK
                         Yes, I'm acquainted with him.

     CLARK can see in JEREMY'S eyes a terrible confusion. CLARK moves closer.

                              CLARK (Cont.)
                         Is there something you want, to tell him, son?

                              JEREMY
                                  (softly)
                         Just tell him I didn't mean to cause him trouble. 
Tell him not to listen to what all these papers 
are saying. I just want him to do what he thinks 
is right. 

     CLARK is moved. He puts an arm on JEREMY'S shoulder. 

CLARK
                         Don't worry. I'm sure Superman cares a lot 
more about what's in one boy's heart than all 
the editorials.

166     CLOSE ON CLARK

     He's made up his mind.

167     CLOSEUP SUPERMAN

     Soaring through the stormy heights of the upper atmosphere. Gale force winds whip his cape.

168     EXT. THE ARCTIC  -  DAY

     The blue-white world of frozen seas and perpetual daylight. SUPERMAN glides toward what 
seems to be glacial mountains, dazzling in reflected light.

169     SUPERMAN LANDS

     He stands for a moment at the base of icy peaks. His thoughts racing. Finally, he stamp his 
foot against the frozen tundra. The ground shakes and shivers rumble through the ice. 
Thunderous echoes resound.

170     THE SNOW-COVERED MOUNTAINS 

     Respond to the pounding tremors. Snow begins to shake loose, snowing down, revealing the 
glimmering surfaces of THE FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE.

171     INT. FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE  -  DAY

     SUPERMAN stands in the centre of the great cavern. Smooth glazed walls surround him. 
The green crystals containing the history of KRYPTON give off emerald lights that dance 
about the ice palace.

172     CLOSEUP SUPERMAN

     He touches and activates the crystals.

173     SUPERMAN'S P.O.V.  -  360 DEGREES

All around him the walls came alive with the distorted sound and image of the past.

(footage from SUPERMAN I to be intercut)

174     THE PLANET KRYPTON

     From outer space as the cataclysm overwhelms it. One small ROCKET escapes this fiery 
apocalypse. The planet explodes. Disintegrating before our eyes.

175     SUPERMAN'S REACTION

     As the terrible fate of his natural home plays once more.

176      CLOSEUP - SUPERMAN

     Wondering if his decision now might have the same effect. Around the cavern, the lights and 
voices soften until they are no more than a polyphony of sighs and a fantasy of colors.

                    SUPERMAN
               I know I have been forbidden to act, but now 
the Earth awaits a fate as terrible as Krypton's.

A beat, and then . . . the great cavern erupts in thunderous cacophony. Sonic vibrations  send SUPERMAN falling to his knees. Another image appears before him.

177     THE PLANET EARTH

     A celestial garden across the universe from KRYPTON. The voices of the ELDERS that 
once argued with JOR-EL now assault his son.

                    ONE VOICE
               The earth is too primitive. You can flee to new 
worlds where war is long forgotten.

     SECOND VOICE 
If you teach the world to put its fate in any one 
man -- even yourself -- you are teaching them to 
be betrayed . . .

     The word 'betrayed' echoes as the image disappears. The bright sunlight of the northern 
world floods into the Fortress.

SUPERMAN
                    You have taught me well . . . but sometimes there 
is more to learn from children than the wisest of 
men.

178     EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE  -  METROPOLIS  -  DAY

     An Eastside trendy bistro catering to the gold card crowd. LOIS and LACY at an outside 
table.

                    LOIS
               The notion that your father would stoop low 
enough to attack Superman just to sell more 
papers . . .

     LACY cuts her off. Her mind is elsewhere.

                         LACY
                    I know I'm not exactly a Girl Scout but . . . 
maybe if I show him I'm trying . . . he'll 
like me.

                         LOIS 
        (off balance)
Who?

     LACY
Clark. He's late again. 
         (frustrated)
I can't figure him out.

LOIS
                    That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now 
will you please pay attention. I'm not through 
insulting your father.

     LACY
Lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not 
like other guys . . . he's different. It's like you come 
from two different worlds.

     A major chord sounds in LOIS'S heart.

                         LOIS 
      (dreamy)
And your heart beats faster just thinking about 
him.

     LACY
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .

                              CONTINUED

178     CONTINUED

     LOIS 
         (wistful) 
But he's never there.

LACY
                          (sisters in arms)
                    Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?

SOUND:  CRASH! A waiter drops a tray of glasses. The GIRLS turn to look.

WAITER 
        (French accent)
Look, up in the sky . . . It's . . .

     LOIS follows his gaze.

                         LOIS 
      (softly)
Superman. . . 

179     P.O.V.  -  ABOVE THE TALL BUILDINGS  -  SUPERMAN

Descending between the concrete canyons of Metropolis. Flying lower and lower until he hovers just above the traffic.

180     EXT.      CITY STREET  -  DAY

     Traffic is stopping. Pedestrians suddenly forget their business obligations. All eyes looking 
up towards . . .

181     ANGLE UP  -  SUPERMAN

Floating overhead. He's looking for 'something or someone.

182     CLOSEUP  -  A HOT DOG WITH RELISH

JEREMY is poised at a Sabrett stand, holding the wiener to his mouth. The FLASH of a camera. JIMMY OLSEN steps forward.

                    JIMMY
               Got it!
     (looking around)
Mr. Warfield said he wanted pictures of you with 
lots of local color, but I can't think of anything else 
really special.

183     JIMMY'S P.O.V.  -  THROUGH THE CAMERA

SUPERMAN steps into the frame.

                         JIMMY 
       (stunned) 
What a scoop!

     SUPERMAN puts his arm around JEREMY. JIMMY snaps the picture.

SUPERMAN
                    Would you mind taking a walk with me?

                         JEREMY     
                    Absolutely!

184     FRONT ANGLE TRACKING  -  SUPERMAN AND JEREMY

     They stride forward along the busy Metropolis street. In their wake a hundred double-takes, 
astonished glances. JIMMY runs along, taking pictures. A few curious onlookers begin to 
follow SUPERMAN. He never varies his pace. Eyes forward. Across a busy intersection. 
Horns blare in recognition. The crowd swells behind him. He looks up.

185     SUPERMAN'S P.O.V. - A HUNDRED FLAGPOLES - AT THE U.N. 

     The flags of the nations. Every colour and every pattern imaginable. They lead in a straight 
row along the river. SUPERMAN quickens his step. JEREMY keeps up. The crowd now 
spills over into the street. POLICE are rushing in to control the excited throng. A 
Volkswagen car forces its way through. LOIS is driving.

186     LOIS AND LACY

Jump out of the car. Start to push their way through the crowd.

187     INT. U.N. LOBBY  -  DAY

     SUPERMAN continues his march across the gleaming marble floor. Two U.N. 
PATROLMEN, one CHINESE, one SWEDISH, stand guard at the doors to the assembly. 
They turn to see SUPERMAN leading a small army of citizens behind him.

CHINESE PATROLMAN 
(to his partner)
                    I don't think he has a pass.

SWEDISH PATROLMAN 
I don't think he needs one.

     THE PATROLMEN OPEN THE DOORS TO THE ASSEMBLY. 

SUPERMAN turns to JEREMY.

                    SUPERMAN
               Would you mind waiting for me in the 
visitor's gallery?

JEREMY 
       (still overwhelmed) 
N-no...I mean...you bet.

     SUPERMAN steps past the PATROLMEN and enters.

188     INT. U.N. GENERAL ASSEMBLY

     On the podium, the Speaker abruptly stops his harangue. The SECRETARY GENERAL, a 
Pakistani woman, wearing a Sari, stands up. Around one by one, delegates turn their heads. 
Some drop their translator earplugs.

189     DOWN THE CENTER AISLE  -  SUPERMAN

     Walking slowly, humbly down the sloped steps. The hall falls silent. Country by country, 
delegates rise from their seats.

190     AT THE PODIUM

     SUPERMAN looks up at the SECRETARY GENERAL.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Madame Secretary, I represent no country. May I 
address the delegates?

     SECRETARY GENERAL 
       (fights to stay calm)
Yes, well... you need a sponsor.

     SUPERMAN turns to the delegates. A beat, then all their hands go up.

SECRETARY GENERAL 
         (smiles)
I believe that will do. Please.

She holds out her hand to the mike. SUPERMAN walks to the stairs of the podium.

191     UP IN THE GALLERY

     REPORTERS are scrambling for the available seats.  JEREMY looks lost. Someone grabs 
his arm.

                    LOIS
               Come with me.

                    JEREMY 
This is intense!

                                   CONTINUED

191     CONTINUED

     She pulls him up front where LACY and JIMMY OLSEN have wrestled front seats in the 
balcony. LOIS gazes down at the extraordinary spectacle.

                    LACY 
      (whispers) 
What's he going to say?

LOIS 
(mesmerized) 
Something . . . wonderful.

192     FROM THE PODIUM  -  SUPERMAN'S P.O.V.

     He waits for the DELEGATES to settle into their seats. Before him is every race and every 
nation on Earth. He steps forward and speaks.

                    SUPERMAN
               For many years I've lived among you as 
a visitor. I've seen beauty in your many 
cultures and I've felt joy in your many 
accomplishments. . . I've also seen the 
folly of your wars . . .

193     PAN THE HALL

MEN in dashikis and women in chadors, visitors with young infants, bureaucrats and house staff  --  all rapt with attention .

                    SUPERMAN
               . . . As of today, I am no longer a visitor.
                      (a beat, his voice grows stronger)
               The Earth is my home too. We cannot live in 
fear. I cannot watch you stumble into the madness 
of nuclear destruction. So I have come to a decision . . .

194     ON THE VISITOR'S GALLERY

     JEREMY leans forward.  LOIS and JIMMY clasp hands.

                         SUPERMAN
                    I am going to do what your governments have been 
unable to do. . . I will rid our planet of all nuclear 
weapons.

195     THE GENERAL ASSEMBLEY

      A second of lag time as the translations are made. Then the delegates leap to their feet in 
wild cheering.

196     VISITORS BALCONY

The civilians applaud, many in tears. LOIS puts her fingers to her mouth to whistle. JIMMY and LACY hug.

                         JEREMY
                          (rebel yell)

The SAILOR shakes hands with the COMMANDER while the CREW cheers.

207C     INT. PENTAGON  -  WAR ROOM

A silver-haired SENATOR turns to the uniformed  CHIEF OF STAFF

                    SENATOR
               So far, so good.
                      (shakes his head)
               It will take even Superman a long time to
dispose of these arsenals.

                         CHIEF OF STAFF 
Let's just make sure he doesn't leave one side with 
few souvenirs.

     SENATOR 
        (snaps) 
I trust Superman.

     CHIEF OF STAFF
So do I. But . . . he's the only person I do trust.

211A INT. PENTAGON WAR ROOM  -  ELECTRONIC SCREEN 

Again the two blips converge.

212     SPACE

     SUPERMAN rides the deadly Soviet missile, guiding it out of the atmosphere. The first step 
of his long peace mission.

213     LOOKING DOWN FROM THE STRATOSPHERE

     We can see the outline of Russia on the curve of the Earth's horizon. A white dot grows 
larger rapidly until we identify SUPERMAN and his heavy load.

214     EXT. SPACE AND GIANT STEEL NET

     SUPERMAN guides the missile into a vast net constructed of steel hawsers which is floating 
in space and filled to capacity with the world's nuclear missiles. He dumps the missile with 
the others and closes the net.

215     MOVING INTO FRAME  -  THE SUN

The yellow star in the sky source of life on Earth, is actually a tremendous concoction of nuclear fusion. Great tentacles of fire roar off its surface. Storms of a billion megaton force bubble in its core.

216     EXT.  SPACE

     With a great effort SUPERMAN whirls the huge net around and around and unleashes it. The 
net grows smaller and smaller on its path to the sun. We lose sight of it for a beat. Then, one 
vibrant orange explosion tells us it has been destroyed. SUPERMAN hovers for a Moment, 
and then turns for home.

217     INT. METROPOLIS TOWER  -  LEX'S LAIR  -  DAY

     A God's eye view of the city. Just the way LEX likes it.

220     LEX LUTHOR

     Hands go up, a smile of seduction comes on.

                         LEX
                    Nice to see you too, gentleman. If we can just 
relax, I'll get started with the introductions.

     The three reluctantly put away their guns and take seats. Now LEX puts on the charm. The 
MEN eye LEX warily as he strolls around the table and rests his hand on HARRY 
HOWLER, a fidgety porcine intellectual.

LEX (Cont.)
                    From the land of the free and the home of the 
cost overrun, let's welcome Harry Howler, 
nuclear strategist for America's top think tank 
and a great warmonger in his own right . . .

     LEX now moves around to DUBOIS, an impeccably dressed, silver-haired gentleman.

                         LEX (Cont.)
                    . . . and next, a hearty bienvenu to Jean-Pierre 
DuBois, nuclear warhead dealer to the world. 
His motto ... " if you didn't buy it from Jean Pierre, 
you didn't buy it on the black market" . . .

     Third is ROMOFF, a bushy-eyebrowed Soviet General in full uniform.

LEX (Cont.)
                    . . . Our third guest has a bad rap for always trying to 
drag his country into war. Some people like to call 
General Romoff the Mad Russian, but to me he's 
just . . . eccentric.

     SOUND:  BAM! A loud retort off screen and ROMOFF jumps up, pulling out a BARETTA 
from his pocket. The others dive under the table, drawing their own guns.

ROMOFF
                    If this is a CIA trap, you'll never take me alive!

My nephew LENNY is learning the drums.
        (he goes to ROMOFF 
         and takes his gun)
Guns don't kill people -- people kill people. Look, 
I know you're all a little choked up right now
         (saunters by each man)
. . . overcome by the joy of knowing that Superman 
is ending the arms race . . . Think of it, Dubois, 
you can finally retire. You can go into something 
nice like home appliances. There's a real mark-up 
in dishwashers . . .

     The guests have slouched low in their chairs.

                         HOWLER
                    Get to the point.

     LEX opens his arms. His smile can only be called Devilish.

                         LEX
                    The points is that I, Lex Luthor, the greatest criminal 
mind of the modern era, have discovered a way
to destroy Superman!

SOUND: BAM!   On LEX'S last word, the room is drowned with the pounding of the 
world's worst drum solo

                    LEX (Cont.)

Oh, Lenny. . . ?

The drumming stops. Sounds of running. LENNY skids into the room, holding a pair 
of drumsticks. LEX holds out his hand. LENNY is a forlorn teenager as he stands 
over the sticks. LEX breaks them in half.

                    LENNY
               Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the 
good part.

                         LEX 
Get the box, nephew.

     LENNY runs out.

                    I warn you, Luthor, if you've dragged us here just 
to tell us you possess a piece of kryptonite . . .

     ROMOFF
We've all tried to use kryptonite before.

     LEX throws up his hands.

Behold, my unscrupulous friends . . .

221     OUT THE WINDOW

     A spectacular view of Metropolis is barely visible for the blinding rays of the SUN in the 
sky.
     
HOWLER 
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.

     LEX
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's 
just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough 
radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .

And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join 
forces with me, together we can make the world 
safe for war profits again.

ROMOFF

What is your plan?

     LENNY runs back in carrying a glass case in rests the petri dish of genetic material.

LEX
                    Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . 
call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one 
of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman 
throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise 
of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his 
first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!

     HOWLER
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can 
defeat Superman?

LEX
                    Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes 
to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with 
power awesome enough to do what none before him 
has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll 
be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.

222     EXT. FORT MASON  -  DAY

     Shooting down onto: The doorway of a gigantic hangar. A FIGURE comes out.

223     CLOSER ON THE FIGURE

     A U.S. AIR FORCE GENERAL, sporting a moustache, military cap pulled down over his 
eyes, pauses to light a cigar.

224     TOP SHOT

     Cigar lit, the GENERAL resumes walking forward - to be followed out of the hangar by a 
massive MISSILE TRANSPORTER. The GENERAL enters a bunker.

225     INT. BUNKER  -  DAY

     The GENERAL joins a SECOND GENERAL standing with other OFFICERS at the 
observation slit to see:

226     THEIR P.O.V. - THROUGH SLIT  - MISSILE TRANSPORTER 

     The giant transporter with its deadly cargo lumbers slowly past.

226A     INT. BUNKER  -  DAY

     The GENERALS raise their binoculars.

     The TRANSPORTER continues on its way.

226C     CLOSE ON MISSILE - BINOCULAR MATTE -  DAY

     The GENERAL'S P.O.V. - a mysterious box attached to the side of the missile.

226D     EXT. RUNWAY -  DAY

     The TRANSPORTER rumbles away down the runway. Reaching the end it raises the 
missile.

226E     EXT. BUNKER  -  DAY

     The GENERALS, binoculars raised, look out from the bunker.

226F     INT. BUNKER  -  DAY

     The, order is given to fire.

226G     EXT. RUNWAY  -  DAY

     The missile is launched.

226H     INT. BUNKER  -  DAY

     The TWO GENERALS. Watching. One lowers his field glasses. It's HOWLER.

HOWLER
                             (whispers nervously to the
                       GENERAL we followed into
    the bunker)
I got your payload on this missile. This is the only chance 
we'll have for Superman to throw it into the sun.

     The OTHER GENERAL lowers his binoculars. It's LEX. He obviously enjoys being 
disguised in military garb.

LEX
                    Stop shivering. Everything's working perfectly.

227     SUPERMAN IN SPACE

Interrupting the missile and guiding the deadly load towards the sun.

AMENDMENT NO.3                                    Revised: 29-Aug-86 (pink)

228     WITH A MIGHTY HEAVE  - SUPERMAN THROWS 

The missile across space. It spirals towards the fiery furnace. Smaller and smaller until it 
plunges into the nuclear soup.

229     SUPERMAN TURNS TO LEAVE

     A beat, then the SUN FLARES behind him. In the deathly silence of the chemical chain 
reaction, LUTHOR'S experiment erupts.

230     SUPERMAN'S P.O.V.

He gazes back toward the sun. Nothing seems amiss. He circles the Earth and heads for Metropolis.

231     ZOOMING BACK TO THE SUN  -  WE WATCH 

     The furious tentacles of flame flicker, once, twice, then tear away from the young star.

232     THE FLAME IN SPACE  -  SPINS INTO A SHAPE

     In the terrible pangs of birth, something forms, something HUMAN in morphology, 
awakening to its own existence.

233     TUMBLING TOWARDS EARTH

     As it falls it sheds its gaseous cocoon, finally exploding apart. It is born . . .

234     THE NUCLEAR MAN REBORN

     We examine it as it examines itself. Its rippling sinews glow with the heat of atomic fusion. 
On his chiseled face is a demonic scowl.

235     CLOSER

The creature is magnificent! Illuminous. And much more frightening than the original creature.

236     CLOSEUP: NUCLEAR MAN'S EYES

     They suddenly glow bright red, like two searing hot coals embedded in flesh. Then they cool 
down and return to normal.

237     NEW ANGLE: THE NUCLEAR MAN'S P.O.V.  -  THE EARTH

     He circles wildly as if angered by something or someone. Then he shoots for earth with a 
ROAR that he breathes out in waves of fire.

238     INT. METRO SPORT CLUB  -  DAY

     A state of the art fitness centre for the young and affluent.

239     AN AEROBICS CLASS

     We SEE the mirrored reflection of rows and rows of young men and women doing bouncy 
calisthenics to a disco trash beat. MOVING DOWN THE ROWS we spot LACY in happy 
sync with the class. NEXT TO HER we pick up CLARK KENT -- in a baggy sweatsuit that 
both obscures his physique and, with his glasses, makes him look more appropriate for 
remedial education. He's perpetually one beat behind. Suddenly the whole class turns to the 
right. CLARK turns left. Then CLARK turns right and they turn left.

CLARK 
         (to LACY)
Maybe I should sit this one out.

     LACY
Don't give up. This is a perfect subject for your 
series on young Metropolis. Now let's get those 
knees up!

240     NAUTILUS ROOM  -  LATER

     LACY and CLARK and lots of lithe bodies on the weight machines. LACY sits down at an 
Overhead Pull Bar and counts off a quick 10.

                    LACY
               Now you try, Clark. We'll start you off with 
60 pounds.

     CLARK 
        (sighs)
If you say so. Here goes.

     He starts to pull at the bar. Straining he gets it halfway down. Then he loses his grip. It acts 
like a catapult sending CLARK off his chair and onto the floor.

                    VOICE (O.S.) 
Need some help?

                                   CONTINUED

240     CONTINUED

Standing over CLARK is PAUL a blow-dried denizen of the club. Tall, well-pumped and
proud as a peacock. PAUL gives CLARK a hand up. Speaks to LACY.

                    PAUL 
                              (smirks)

     He pulls CLARK up.

                         LACY
                    Clark, this is Paul.

     PAUL lifts a bar with four giant weights attached.

PAUL 
                                      (to CLARK)
               Want to try this one, Clark?

                    CLARK 
I don't think so.

     He hands it to CLARK who immediately follows the bar to the floor. The whole room laughs 
at CLARK.

PAUL 
No pain, no gain.

     PAUL walks away to continue his workout while LACY helps CLARK up.

                         LACY
                    He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like 
a lot of people I know are jerks . . .
              (looks up at him)
     . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. 
That's why you keep avoiding me.

     CLARK 
I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . 
I like you . . . I really do.

I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll

CLARK is trapped.

CLARK 
       (stumbling) 
Gee, I don't think . . .

     LACY
Come early. The view is so romantic from 
my balcony.

PAUL comes over to have another joke at CLARK'S expense. He tests the largest barbell. It 
won't budge. Then taps CLARK.

                    PAUL 
      (smirking)
Could you hand me those weights, Clark? They're 
very light.

     CLARK 
        (horrified) 
I mean, Lacy . . .

     LACY waves and runs into the girl's locker room. PAUL nudges CLARK again.

He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to

                         LEX 
What was that about?

     LENNY
Didn't you see it? He lifted me up and crashed 
me down.

     LEX
Hmm . . . Nuclear levitation. Now that's a trick that 
could come in handy.

During this  LENNY has been staring off towards the Vestibule. He draws LEX'S attention to what he sees. Both look off at:

248     DELETED

249     FROZEN JUST INSIDE THE DOORWAY 

     Their P.O.V.

     NUCLEAR MAN has stopped in mid-step. He has stepped out of the shaft of sunlight into 
the shade. He is still immobile. LEX and LENNY move back to him, LEX reaches out and 
touches him.

                    LEX
               He's . . . cold. . .

                    LENNY
               Good. Let's hope he stays that way.

LEX thinks for a beat.

                    LEX 
         (figures it out)
                    Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way 
he can be stopped. 

     LENNY
What?

     LEX just smiles at LENNY.

                    Lenny, my loud-mouthed nephew, he gets 
his power from sunlight! In darkness . . . 
he's like you . . . useless.

250     EXT. TIMES SQUARE  -  DAY

     The crowded Metropolis intersection is dwarfed by the huge electronic specticolor sign 
flashing brilliantly colored ADVERTISEMENTS.

251     EXT. METROPOLIS HYATT HOTEL  -  DAY

Glass elevators climb the hotel walls.

252     INT. THE WARFIELDS' SUITE  -  DAY

     A table for four has been prepared by the window. LOIS checks herself in the mirror. LACY 
hurries out from her room. She's poured into a sexy dress. 

                    LACY 
      (excited)
This is just like a double date! . . . How do 
I look?

     She pirouettes.

                         LOIS
                    Illegal . . . just like you looked in the six other 
dresses you tried on. Believe me, no matter 
what you wear, Clark will not notice.

     The doorbell RINGS.

                         LACY
                    Clark!
                                (takes two steps, stops) 
. . . but maybe it's Superman.

     LOIS slides open the balcony door.

                         LOIS
                    Superman likes to make a different kind of 
entrance.

LACY answers the door.  It's CLARK KENT.

                    LACY
               Hi, Clark.

                    CLARK 
       (distracted)
Hello, Lacy. Can anybody break a twenty? 
The cabbie didn't have any change.

LACY
                           (disappointed)
                    . . . Let me get my purse.

     She leaves and CLARK wanders into the dining room where LOIS is placing a vase of roses 
on the table.

                    LOIS
                           (matter of fact)
               Oh, hi, Clark. Can you believe it! Warfield gave 
me a list of questions to ask Superman.

     She hands a typed piece of paper to CLARK.

                         CLARK 
      (skimming) 
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken 
our national defense?'

                         LOIS
                    It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you 
ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb 
question.

     CLARK
Politely?
     
     LACY comes back in with her purse.

LACY
                    I've got eighteen dollars . . . and a gold card.

     LOIS leans over to CLARK.

                         LOIS 
      (whispers) 
She's nuts about you. Notice her dress.

                    . . . Um, hey! Neat dress.

     LOIS rolls her eyes.  CLARK never gets the romance right.

                         LACY
                    Shouldn't you pay the cabbie?

                         CLARK
                    Oh . . . Right. . . I'll be back in a flash.

He leaves and the door is closed. SOUND: WHOOSH. A beat and LACY re-opens the door.

252A     THE CORRIDOR

     A flash of SUPERMAN'S red and blue turns the corner as LACY'S head comes around the 
door.

                    LACY
               Clark!
CLARK returns into her view. LACY holds out the forgotten taxi change which he takes and 
exits. LACY exits closing the door behind her.

253     LOIS AND LACY

     Walking back to the dining room, they HEAR the same WHOOSH out on the balcony.

                         LACY
                    What's that?

                         LOIS
                    Our other dinner guest. 

SUPERMAN walks in from the balcony.

                    SUPERMAN
               Hi, Lois. It's been a long time. 

254     CLOSE ON LOIS

Her eyes sparkle. And once again we're reminded that no matter how tough, no matter how 
caustic, LOIS LANE is at heart a romantic. And her heart will forever hold only one word - SUPERMAN!

LOIS
                    Too long.
                          (beat)
                    Superman, I'd like you to meet Lacy Warfield. 
The boss's daughter.

     LACY curtsies instinctively.

                         SUPERMAN
                    Very nice to meet you. That's a lovely dress 
                    you're wearing.

                         LOIS
                    Well . . . I think I can start the interview without 
Clark . . . Two is company.

LACY
                    I better fetch Clark. He's probably helping the 
cabbie change a flat tire or some other good deed!

     SUPERMAN reacts and LACY runs out. He's got to cover. LOIS takes SUPERMAN'S arm.

                         LOIS
                    We'll be more comfortable in here.

     They stroll into the main room. SUPERMAN glances at the elaborate table.

                         SUPERMAN 
                    Something smells wonderful.

     She sits next to SUPERMAN on the sofa. Very close.

LOIS
                    Just a little duck and scallops in champagne 
sauce . . . in case we got hungry . . . later.

255     X-RAY VISION P.O.V.

SUPERMAN looks into the kitchen, through the oven, where the dish cooking. Using his 
X-RAY VISION , we SEE the food glow for a few seconds. He's cooking it quickly. It's his 
only chance to get LOIS out of the room. He smiles at LOIS.

                    SUPERMAN
               I hope it wasn't too much trouble.

She smiles like a teenager with a crush.

                    LOIS
               Of course not.
                           (as Superman hands her 
      the reporter's pad)
Right, the interview . . . Have you had any trouble 
confiscating the missiles?

     SUPERMAN
Well, Lois, there is always the chance that a 
few warped individuals who would take 
advantage of the world's good will

LOIS 
       (sniffing)
Oh, my God! Dinner ! Don't budge , I'll be 
right back.

     She runs out of the room. SUPERMAN smiles.

256     INT. LOBBY -  THE ELEVATOR  -  DAY

     LACY steps off into the lobby, looking for CLARK. 

257     COMING THROUGH THE MAIN ENTRANCE

     CLARK KENT, adjusting his tie as if he just put it on. CLARK waves and hurries to her. 
LACY'S eyes sparkle at CLARK, just like LOIS' at SUPERMAN.

                    LACY
               I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with 
just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's 
go do something wild!

     CLARK
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.

She takes his arm as they cross the lobby.

                    LACY
               How can one man be so square and so delicious. 
Very well. We'll go back up and make chit-chat. 
But if I have to face Superman, so do you.

     CLARK blanches as they reach . . .

258     THE ELEVATOR

     The doors open. The BELLBOY holds a dolly laden with baggage. LACY steps onto the 
elevator.

259     CLOSEUP CLARK

     As he steps on he hooks his jacket sleeve onto the dolly. The BELLBOY pushes forward, 
taking CLARK with him.

CLARK
Oh . . . my . . . 

     LACY 
      (as the doors close)
Clark. . . !

260     WARFIELDS' SUITE

     LOIS is coming out of the kitchen with an apron on.

                         LOIS
                    It's funny. I've never had duck turn out so 
perfect, Superman . . . Superman? . . . 

     He's not on the couch. A confused moment . . .

                         SUPERMAN  (O.S.)
On the balcony.

261     LOIS WALKS ONTO THE BALCONY

     She stands with SUPERMAN, overlooking the giant specticolor billboard. LOIS cherishes a 
silent moment with him.

                         LOIS
                    The city looks beautiful doesn't it?

     SUPERMAN turns to her eyes and looks directly into her eyes.

SUPERMAN
                    Yes it does. Very beautiful. Our whole world 
is beautiful.

     LOIS' voice trembles lightly.

                         LOIS
                    I think beauty is meant to be shared . . . 
with someone you . . . love.

     She bites her lip as if' to make sure she's not moving too fast. Then the doorbell RINGS. 
LOIS sighs.

SUPERMAN 
They're back.

     LOIS unhappily goes back inside.

262     FRONT DOOR

     LOIS opens it and lets LACY enter.

LOIS
                    Where's Clark?

                         LACY
                    He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage 
and . . .  oh, it's a long story.

     LOIS
It always is with Clark.

261     CONTINUED

     She closes the door behind LACY. SOUND: RING. A beat, then the doorbell again. LOIS      opens it. It's CLARK.

                         CLARK 
Hi. Is dinner ready? I'm famished.

LACY           
Let's sit down.
     They walk to the table. LOIS calls out to the balcony.

                         LOIS
                    Superman!
     (no answer)
I'll get him.

     SOUND: CRASH - glass breaking. LOIS turns. CLARK has knocked several dishes on the
floor and spilled wine on his trousers.

                    CLARK 
Gee, I'm really sorry.

     LACY
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.

     LOIS comes over to help LACY.

263     LOW ANGLE  -  THEY KNEEL TO THE FLOOR 

     We HEAR a WHOOSH. Then two RED BOOTS appear between the GIRLS.

                         SUPERMAN (O.S.) 
Careful. Don't cut yourself. 

Now the GIRLS hear CLARK'S voice.

CLARK (O.S.) 
I better go wash this off before the stain sets.

     LOIS and LACY stand up.

                         LACY 
Now we can eat.

     Only neither CLARK nor SUPERMAN is there.

LOIS 
Now they're both gone. This getting ridiculous.
264     ON THE BALCONY  -  SUPERMAN

     He's staring intently at the giant electronic billboard.

265     ON THE BILLBOARD  

We SEE LEX'S FACE where there were advertisements. LEX gives a big smile

                    LEX

'Some enchanted evening You may see a 
stranger.'

268     INT. LACY'S SUITE  

LOIS is at the table setting out salad dishes.  SUPERMAN appears.

                    SUPERMAN
               I'm terribly sorry, Lois. But an emergency has 
arisen. Please apologize to your guests. Good night.

     SUPERMAN circles the building cautiously, when . . . SOUND: POP! The noise draws him 
down to the Observation Deck. Winds buffet his cape.

271     STEPPING ONTO THE DECK  -  LEX IN A TUXEDO

     Holding a bottle of champagne.

272     FACE TO FACE  -  LEX AND SUPERMAN

     LEX raises the champagne bottle.

                    Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a 
bomb you'd be far away from here by now.

     LEX
Silly me. How do I ever think I can fool the super 
guy. You're right, no bomb. I just knew you were 
too busy with the world peace bit to make a social 
call.  I confess . . . I tricked you. Hey, you look 
great!

273     A BLINDING LIGHT

Begins to descend from the sky, floating over the top of the skyscraper. SUPERMAN turns 
to look as, landing on the deck, comes the impossible vision of . .  . 

274     THE NUCLEAR MAN

     In all his terrible ferocity. He slowly reins in his energy as his body assumes its most human 
appearance  --  but not before the radiation from his skin melts the safety railing on the deck, 
as his eyes glow red.

     Quickly, he begins to analyze the creature using his X-RAY VISION.

Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, 
You know the type. With you gone, we'll make 
a fortune rearming the world.

     SUPERMAN
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own 
personal financial gains.

     LEX
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat 
alive.

     SUPERMAN
A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And 
you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm 
taking you in.

279     THE NUCLEAR MAN

     His eyes and skin start to glow then actually turn molten . . . and thereby elastic.

280     HE FLARES TO TWICE HIS SIZE

     His proportions distend horribly, as his body radiates a foul cloud of heat. Flexing his fiery 
sinews he returns to a normal human size. A display meant for SUPERMAN.

LEX
                    Nifty, huh?
                               (supping his champagne) 
Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . 
inevitable
     ( to NUCLEAR MAN )
Now, destroy Superman.

          NUCLEAR MAN 
First, I have fun.

281     ON SUPERMAN  -  AS THE MONSTER SPRINGS

     Clenching SUPERMAN, the nuclear beast carries him backward and OVER THE EDGE . . .

282     TUMBLING TOWARDS THE GROUND

     A hundred stories.

 MOVE IN -- clasped in combat, SUPERMAN sees his adversary -- eyes glowing bloody 
red.

283     THE NUCLEAR MAN BREAKS AWAY

And streaks off towards the West. SUPERMAN stops his fall just above the sidewalk and flies off in pursuit of LEX'S beast.

284     HEADING WEST

     The NUCLEAR MAN disappears over the horizon. SUPERMAN starts to close the gap.

285     CLOSEUP:  SUPERMAN  -  ABOVE THE EARTH

     Passing over the mountains and rivers of the Eastern United States.

286     COMING INTO VIEW - A STORM

     Dark purple clouds blowing over the Ohio valley. LIGHTNING flares as the winds picks up.      At least we THINK its lightning . . .

287     ON THE GROUND  -  A SMALL OHIO TOWN

     A cluster of homes around a steepled church. The storm blows into the town.

288     OUT OF THE CLOUDS

     What we saw as lightning was none other than . . .

289     THE NUCLEAR MAN

     Trailing light. An eerie grin on his face, he starts to circle through the churning
     storm . . . at impossible speeds . . . churning and turning the storm into . . .

290     A FUNNEL CLOUD

     That descends as a TORNADO into the town.

291     SUPERMAN'S P.O.V.

     The town will surely be destroyed if he doesn't act.

292     A FARMHOUSE

A YOUNG FAMILY runs from the house as the tornado batters its windows and uproots its 
crops. The FATHER, WIFE and TWO CHILDREN fight the wind to reach a storm cellar.

                    WIFE 
                  (shouting above the wind) 
Where's Jenny!

FATHER 
         (panics)
She must still be in the house!

     The YOUNG FATHER tries to return to the house, but he's knocked down by the winds. 
Suddenly, he's helped up by . . .

293     SUPERMAN

     Landing by the house.

                         FATHER
                    Jenny's inside!

     The tornado begins to lift the house off its foundation. SUPERMAN flies into the eye of the 
tornado. He circles in the opposite direction of the twister  --  faster and faster until he's Just a 
red blur. The tornado slows its rotation gradually.

294     THE FAMILY

     Watches as the tornado dissipates into a soft mist. The sun breaks through -- its warm light 
bathes the family.

295     SUPERMAN STEPS OUT OF THE HOUSE

     Carrying two-year-old JENNY, he hands the child to her parents. On a distant hill stands the 
NUCLEAR MAN  --  he seems to be taunting SUPERMAN .

296     SUPERMAN FLIES OFF 

In pursuit of the NUCLEAR MAN.

297     CIRCLING THE GLOBE

     Passing the continent below. He's gaining on the monster as they pass over California.

298     THE NUCLEAR MAN

     Turns towards SUPERMAN and they grapple in space. SUPERMAN lands a tremendous 
blow and NUCLEAR MAN plummets earthward into cloud. Then he rockets below and 
disappears.

299- 307 DELETED

308     STREAKING

     Out of the cloud, NUCLEAR MAN.  Below is:

309     THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA  -  DAY 

     CHINESE and ANGLO TOURISTS mill about, taking and posing for pictures, buying 
souvenirs etc.

310     NUCLEAR MAN'S P.O.V.

     As he descends from the sky towards the GREAT WALL. 

311     AT THE WALL

     NUCLEAR MAN arrives and begins his destruction. Hurling stones and bricks everywhere.

312     THE TOURISTS

     Panic and scatter.

313     SUPERMAN

     Flies toward the scene. The NUCLEAR MAN sees him and starts a barrage of stones and 
bricks in the direction of SUPERMAN. He hurls hundreds of them, at super-speed, into 
SUPERMAN'S path. SUPERMAN knocks them aside and heads for the WALL.

314     A TOURIST

     Running from the scene, slips and falls off the edge of the WALL. SUPERMAN flies in, 
catches her, and returns her safely to her husband.

315     A BLUR OF MOTION

     As SUPERMAN, re-assembles the WALL. In a moment, every brick and stone is back in 
place. He looks up to see NUCLEAR MAN flying away. He takes off to follow.

315A     EXT. SPACE
     
     SUPERMAN catches up with NUCLEAR MAN. They struggle and NUCLEAR MAN tries
to scratch SUPERMAN with his GLOWING FINGERNAILS. SUPERMAN recoils, 
allowing his adversary to escape earthwards where he appears:

316     OVER A VOLCANO

     Which towers by a peaceful seaside town. NUCLEAR MAN sees the volcano and smiles. 
First his eyes, then his entire being, glows red.

317     HE DIVES

     Straight into the volcano's mouth. A BEAT, then suddenly, a tremendous explosion - 
NUCLEAR MAN comes roaring out of the belching smoke, the deadly river of molten lava 
following.

318     THE TOWN BELOW

     As church bells start ringing, sounding the general alarm, TOWNSPEOPLE look up to see 
the lava moving down the slopes towards them.

319     SUPERMAN

     Flies into view. He spies another mountain sitting peacefully nearby. At SUPER-SPEED he 
flies around and into it, as if his very body were a buzz saw, cutting the top off and flies it to 
the volcano.

320     LIKE A CORK

     He drops the mountain top, inverted, onto the volcano, stopping the flow of lava.

321     THE TOWNSPEOPLE

     Cower in fear, as the lava, which did escape makes its inexorable way down the 
mountainside.

322     SUPERMAN

     Blows his SUPER-BREATH into the lava flow, freezing it in, place and takes off once more 
in pursuit of NUCLEAR MAN.

     Two contrails rise.

326B     EXT. SPACE

     Once more, they fight, NUCLEAR MAN'S fiery, glowing claws reach for SUPERMAN'S 
face. SUPERMAN starts blowing his ICY SUPERBREATH.

326C     NUCLEAR MAN

     Recoi1s as his hands freeze. Now he, in his turn, blows ice-cold breath at SUPERMAN who 
instantly starts to freeze into:

326D     A BLOCK OF ICE

     Which slowly tumbles away into space.

326E     SUPERMAN ENCASED IN THE BLOCK OF ICE 

He eventually smashes free.

326F     BACK OVER THE EARTH

     SUPERMAN continues the chase.

     A BIG PARADE is in progress complete with military hardware, missiles etc.

     The POLITBURO take the salute.

NUCLEAR MAN releases a POWER BOLT 

326J     ON MISSILE CARRIER

     The BOLT ZAPS the wheels and the carrier swings wildly off course so that its deadly 
missile points straight at the dignitaries on the podium. At the very moment of impact, SUPERMAN arrives and forces the warhead away from the Russian leaders.

326K     EXT. MOSCOW SKYLINE

     Very wide shot - the two protagonists fly off right to left.

326L     ABOVE THE CLOUDS

     SUPERMAN temporarily loses sight of his opponent who suddenly reappears and again tries 
desperately to claw at SUPERMAN'S skin. With great effort, SUPERMAN throws him off 
and he dives like a fireball down into the clouds.

327     THE STATUE OF LIBERTY

     NUCLEAR MAN lands at its base. Reads the plaque "Send me your tired, your poor etc." 
with disdain. He looks up.

328     EXT. SKY OVER METROPOLIS FLYING INTO FRAME - SUPERMAN

     Weakened, fatigued and hurt from the battle. He searches above the streets for NUCLEAR 
MAN.

329     CLOSE ON SUPERMAN

     He hears something and looks back.

330     HIS P.O.V.

     The empty plinth!  The Statue of Liberty has disappeared! 

330A     SUPERMAN

Reacts and turns.

330B     OVER METROPOLIS

     His P.O.V. -  The Statue of Liberty being propelled through the air by NUCLEAR MAN.

330C     SUPERMAN

     Intercepts NUCLEAR MAN who drops the Statue so that it falls towards the crowded city 
streets. SUPERMAN dives and catches the statue before it can hit the ground.

330D     OVER METROPOLIS

     SUPERMAN flies the Statue above the city back to its rightful place, when, SUDDENLY:

330E     ON STATUE OF LIBERTY AND SUPERMAN

     NUCLEAR MAN appears through the observation door in the torch. SUPERMAN is 
helpless, burdened by the Statue, as NUCLEAR MAN closes with him and pierces his skin with his claws.

     He breaks away.

331     ON SUPERMAN

     Instantly weakened by the intense radiation, and in agony, SUPERMAN just finds the 
strength to replace the Statue before tumbling to the ground at the base of the Statue.

332     CLOSEUP:  SUPERMAN

     He looks up to see NUCLEAR MAN.

333     ONE SWIFT KICK

From the giant creature sends SUPERMAN off into the sky, up, up out of sight.

     SUPERMAN goes right off the earth and out into space.

334     SUPERMAN'S CLOAK

     Woven by MA KENT from the blanket that sheltered the baby KAL-EL on his long journey 
from KRYPTON  -  the cloak floats down through the clouds. It comes to rest on the point of 
the flame of the true Liberty. Limp, fluttering, an empty shell.

How do you know that Superman actually 
destroyed everyone else's missiles?

Because he told you? We don't even know if he's 
really dead? We don't really know if right at this 
very moment he isn't taking all your bombs out of 
a hiding place and handing them over to the other guys.

Gentlemen, Lex Luthor is here to replenish your nuclear 
stockpiles. At a very affordable price. It's my way of 
saying . . . forgive me.

You know him so well.
        (a beat)
But I'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.

356     EXTREME CLOSE UP: LOIS

     She decides to say what's in her heart.

                              LOIS
                         But if he wasn't able to manage . . . if he really was 
in trouble, then I'd want to tell him some things . . . 
      (CLARK looks at her)
. . . I'd want to tell him that I cherished the time we spent 
together. And I never expected anything from him. Even if 
I only saw him for a few moments, it made me happy. And I'd 
want to tell him that I love him and that I'II always love him. 
And . . . no matter what happens on this world, I know he tried 
his best to help us . . .

     LOIS chokes back tears. CLARK lifts his trembling hand to her cheek.

                              CLARK
                         I know he'd thank you, Lois.

     A long moment of electricity, then . . .

CLARK (Cont.)
. . . now if you'll excuse me . . . I'm very tired . . . 
Just let me rest by myself.
           (intense) 
Please, Lois.

LOIS knows she has no choice. She nods. CLARK opens the door for LOIS.

357     CLOSE ON LOIS AND CLARK

 She hugs him as if it's for the last time.

                         LOIS 
                             (fighting back tears) 
Feel better soon, Clark. 
      (beat)
And if you should see him or hear from him . . .

She points to the package she's left.

LOIS (cont.) 
He might need that.

She runs off. CLARK goes to the package and opens it carefully, deliberately. The  unmistakable red of SUPERMAN'S cape spills out.

358     THE NIGHT SKY OVER METROPOLIS

The sky sparkles with the frozen fires of a million stars.

359     INT. CLARK'S APARTMENT  -  NIGHT

CLARK stands at the mirror staring in disbelief. Something  is happening to him.
 
360     PUSH IN SLOWLY 

     His skin is wrinkled, hair greying. He is aging. He slowly holds up his hand, where he was
     scratched.

361     INT. CLARK'S BEDROOM  -  NIGHT

From the back of his closet, CLARK retrieves the energy module he took from the space 
capsule in SMALLVILLE.

362     EXT. THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING  -  NIGHT

     CLOSE ON CLARK: As he passes in and out of silvery pools of moonlight. He carries the 
module.

363     IN BRIEF FLASHES  -  WE SEE CLARK CHANGING 

Each time his face is illuminated it seems to be aging! It is a  subtle but melancholy effect. 
But mortality is raging through CLARK'S body. With his last bit of strength he places the 
module on the ledge. He reaches out to switch it on. A beat, then, a SOFT HUM, musical, 
mesmerizing -- begins, and a liquid GREEN LIGHT' flows from the module.

JOR-EL
                    . . . All that remains of Krypton's energy . . . is 
yours. . . after it is gone, you will belong solely to
your new home . . .

CLARK grips the concrete edge of the roof. Stretching out below him, the city lights flow 
and bleed into each other.

                    JOR-EL (Cont.)
               . . . if our dying planet can save your life my son . . . 
we have not died in vain . . .

364     CLOSE ON CLARK 

As he loses consciousness and is enveloped by the healing light. JOR-EL'S VOICE fades . . .
forever.

365     EXT. THE METROPOLIS SKYLINE  -  NIGHT

Against the moon drenched sky. The top of CLARK'S building glows green. Then, it stops. All is silent.

366     INT. LEX'S LAIR

     As the dawn light comes through the windows, hitting . . .

367     THE NUCLEAR MAN 

     Standing statue-still in the center of the room.

368     CLOSER ANGLE

     As his eyes pop open, his arms lose their rigidity, and his radioactive blood begins to 
circulate. He shakes his head and yawns, though it is more like a growl.

369     CLOSER ON THE NUCLEAR MAN

     He notices the front page of The Daily Planet lying on the table. 

370     INSERT -  FRONT PAGE

An attractive photo of LACY is captioned 'NEW PUBLISHER FOR YOUR FAVORITE PAPER'

371     THE NUCLEAR MAN

     His genetic memory kicks in. This is the woman he fell in love with at the disco. His entire 
demeanor changes as bold desire courses through him. Again, his eyes glow red. He reaches 
out gently to touch LACY'S photo. The paper flares into flames.

372     LEX ENTERS

     Knotting a tie with his dressed-for-success suit.
     
                         LEX 
      (camp counselor)
Morning, morning. We've got a heavy schedule. I want 
to show you off to a few world leaders. We're expanding 
into the insurance market.
      (chuckles to himself)
I'll insure them against you!

                                                  CONTINUED
372     CONTINUED

     LEX sits down at the mountain of CASH and begins to fondle the bills.

LEX
                    I love the smell of money in the morning.

373     NUCLEAR MAN 

His eyes glow red and then . . . he shoots HEAT-VISION at the mountain of cash and SETS 
IT AFLAME. LEX howls in despair.

                    LEX 
Stop! I command you . . . you mutant!

NUCLEAR MAN 
       (threatening) 
I am master now.

374     LENNY ENTERS

     As the NUCLEAR MAN breathes a tongue of flame to finish the job of incinerating the 
money. LEX can't help himself. He draws out a handkerchief to dab away tears.
 
NUCLEAR MAN
                    Wait for my return. I will bring back the girl.

375     HE GOES TO THE WINDOW AND FLIES OFF 

376     LENNY RUNS TO LEX

                         LENNY
                    Gee Uncle Lex, I thought you could control that 
Nuclear guy! You made a significant screw-up, huh?

     LEX sifts his hands through the ashes of his money.

                         LEX 
Shut up, Leonard.

377     INT. DAILY PLANET -  DAY

     WARFIELD is arguing with LACY in her office.

                         WARFIELD 
             (bellows)
     Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common 
man reads!
     
     LACY
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.

     WARFIELD
Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught
you long ago the business of newspapers is business.

     LACY takes a deep breath. Challenging her father has become easier.

                         LACY
                    No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue 
to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone 
into a disaster.

     WARFIELD
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster 
could we help bring about?

     A RUMBLE sounds O.S. and then the room shakes. WARFIELD and LACY exchange 
nervous looks.

378     CRASHING THROUGH THE WALL - THE NUCLEAR MAN

     He seers a hole through the concrete and stands at his full rock-solid height, eyes burning 
with the image of LACY.

                    WARFIELD
               Oh my god ... what is it?

THE NUCLEAR MAN gives what seems to be smile, then begins to walk towards LACY.

                    LACY
               Daddy . . . !

WARFIELD tries to stand between them but THE NUCLEAR MAN swats him away. He 
lands unconscious against the wall. STAY ON WARFIELD as O.S. we HEAR LACY 
scream . . .

379     INT. LEX'S LAIR  -  DAY

      LEX, LENNY and LACY MAN are 'guests' of the NUCLEAR MAN.

                         LEX 
                 (still trying to retain control) 
You know I am about out of patience. Just say you're 
sorry , about the cash and . . .

     THE NUCLEAR MAN shoots LEX a silencing look. In his face we see an arrogance that 
would suit LEX himself.

                    LEX (Cont.) 
                 (sotto to Lenny)
     He's starting to get on my nerves.

     He turns back to NUCLEAR MAN.

                         LEX (Cont.) 
       (desperate)
. . .  okay. Forget that cash. We'll get more. We've got 
everybody right where we want them -- sitting on their 
bomb buttons . . . scanning the skies . . . staring intently
at their rocket screens. Any little blip would set off war. 
Full alert. The perfect environment to maximize profits.

     THE NUCLEAR MAN smiles insidiously at LEX. An idea begins to form. He turns to 
LACY.

NUCLEAR MAN 
I will return for you.
     
     He strokes her hair. A beat, then LACY SLAPS him. His face glows red tracing the 
     impression on her hand. His eyes glow red.

                         LACY
                    Never!

                         NUCLEAR MAN 
But first, I have fun.

     He smiles again and steps out onto . . .

380     EXT. OBSERVATION DECK

381     PAN DOWN  -  THE NUCLEAR MAN

     He suddenly stands still. Rigid. Then his very skin starts to change color. It glows white hot. 
Until it takes on an almost metallic sheen. Pressing his arms at his sides. . .
382     THE MONSTER CHANGES SHAPE

     Stretching himself until he has become . . .

383     A NUCLEAR MISSILE

     His head assumes a conical shape. Eyes now focused to the sky. Smoke spews from this 
living bomb. The nightmare of the nuclear age man and missile.

                    LEX
               Are you crazy? You'll start a war. . They'll be nobody 
left except you . . . a beast.

     LACY steps on the platform. LEX understands.

                         LEX (Cont.)
. . . and a beauty.

384     THE NUCLEAR MAN - MISSILE

Smiles through his now metallic face. 

385     LACY WATCHES

As flames erupt and the NUCLEAR MAN/MISSILE begins to RISE INTO THE SKY with a deafening scream.

386     OVER METROPOLIS

     The beast soars higher and higher on his evil mission.

387     LEX AND LENNY

     Watching.

LENNY
                    We'll all fry.

                         LEX
                    This wasn't in the plan.

                         LENNY
                    I think he has his own plan, Uncle Lex.

388     INT. PENTAGON  -  THE WAR ROOM

     All eyes are on the giant computer screen. Watching for any unidentified object. A radar 
TECHNICIAN leaps from his seat. He wears a HEADSET.

TECHNICIAN
                    I've got something.

     The CHIEF OF STAFF along with the SECRETARIES run to the screen.

389     ON THE SCREEN

     A blip begins moving across the map.

                         CHIEF
                    Do we have identification?

                         TECHNICIAN
                    It's not ours.
                                 (listens to his headset) 
They say it's not theirs either.

     The CHIEF looks at the others.

                         NAVY
                    Can we risk launching?

                         ARMY

                    What if it's not theirs?

                         SECOND GENERAL 
What if it is!

     THIRD GENERAL 
         (soberly)
We haven't given ourselves any other choice.
         (shakes his head) 
Prepare to counter-attack.

391     BACK TO LEX'S LAIR - LEX, LACY, LENNY

     LENNY drags out two heavy suitcases to the elevators. LEX is clearing his desk.

                         LEX 
                 (to LACY)
Don't worry honey, I'm sure he'll make a swell husband.

     LENNY
Ready, Uncle Lex?

LEX

                    Still having delusions, Lex Luthor?

     LACY runs to SUPERMAN.

LACY

394      LEX -  DECIDES TO CHANGE HIS TUNE

LEX
                    Uh... right! You've got to stop him. He's mad! I did what

     His face shows rock steady dedication, earnest concern.

dangerous . . .

                         LACY
                    Ready. Let's see what I'm made of.

402     SUPERMAN DROPS LACY

     She hurtles towards the surging ocean. NUCLEAR MAN takes the bait and dives after her.

403     BACK TO THE PENTAGON

     The BLIP disappears from the radar screens.

                         TECHNICIAN

The SOVIET GENERAL literally leaps to punch the button that will stop the countdown.

Looks up to see:

405A     SUPERMAN

     Hurtling towards him.

406     SUPERMAN AND NUCLEAR MAN

     They collide. SUPERMAN restrains NUCLEAR MAN from pursuing LACY who tumbles 
     faster and faster towards the grey, choppy waters of the Atlantic.

406A     THE TWO SUPER BEINGS

Racing for the free falling LACY. In a sudden burst of speed, SUPERMAN overhauls his

408     NUCLEAR MAN SWOOPS DOWN TO THE STREETS

408A     ON THE STREET NEAR METROPOLIS TOWER

     NUCLEAR MAN lands in a busy street by the Metropolis Tower. SUPERMAN stands alone 
by the entrance, waiting and watching.

408B     CLOSE ON TAXI DRIVER 

     Horrified at the sudden appearance of a FLAMING MAN in the path of his cab.

408C     WIDER: THE CAB

     As it screeches into NUCLEAR MAN'S force field and another cab crashes into the back of 
it.

The CABBIE leaps out, furious at NUCLEAR MAN, not noticing the shortsighted OLD LADY climbing, oblivious to the drama, into the back of his vehicle.

                    NUCLEAR MAN 
Where is the woman?

     SUPERMAN
Give it up. You'll never find her.

410A     A PARKED CAR EXPLODES

410B     CLOSE ON NUCLEAR MAN

     Another energy bolt and:  A STREAM OF FIRE lances out past the terrified crowd. People 
scream and shout.

410C     CLOSE ON SUPERMAN 

A mighty BREATH sweeps the flames away from the fleeing people. He rushes to the aid of 
a DISTRESSED WOMAN and looks back to see:

410D     SUPERMAN'S P.O.V  -  UNDERSIDE OF CAB 

The taxi rises into the air.

410E     INT. CAB

     The CABBIE is transfixed with terror. THE OLD WOMAN calmly gives him the address 
she wishes to go to.

410F     NUCLEAR MAN

     Waves of energy pour from his fingers and a second cab rises into the air.

410G     AS SUPERMAN WATCHES

     The cabs float high above the street. The PASSENGERS in the second cab screaming with 
terror until:

SUDDENLY a MAN tumbles out. SUPERMAN takes off as the MAN hangs from the 
opened door.

410H     WIDE.SHOT - FIRE ENGINE

     Alarms sounding, tires screaming, it comes round the corner towards camera. NUCLEAR 
MAN goes to meet the new threat, allowing the TWO CABS to plummet towards the ground. 
SUPERMAN saves both and sets them gently down. THE OLD LADY gets out and turns to 
the CABBIE.

               OLD LADY
                    How much do I owe you, young man?

411      SUPERMAN

     Looks up. A burst of energy hits him and he crashes back through the doors of the tower 
while NUCLEAR MAN now continues to demonstrate his power in a violent confrontation 
with the fire Department.

411A     THE POLICE ARRIVE

     Riot guns at the ready, the POLICE shelter behind their car.

POLICEMAN
                    Okay, Buster. Hold it right there.

But:

411B     NUCLEAR MAN

     A RAY darts out from his eyes and the POLICE are sucked into their car. The doors slam 
shut and NUCLEAR MAN hurls the car skyward where it sticks on the side of a building, its 
occupants transfixed with fear.

411C     EXT. BUILDING AND CAR

     The car jolts downwards.  Faster and faster, until: 

SUPERMAN catches it at the very bottom of the building

411D     NUCLEAR MAN

     Enjoying himself as a SWAT TEAM arrives and more weapons are aimed at the monster.

                         SWAT COMMANDER 
Let him have it!
     
But NUCLEAR MAN bends, melts and radiates the hostile weapons and the SWAT 
VEHICLE itself flips over and spins like a top flinging out the last occupant who falls 
straight into the arms of SUPERMAN.

411E     NUCLEAR MAN

     Striding through the chaos, leaps onto the roof of a car and orchestrates another orgy of 
explosive mayhem

411F     SUPERMAN

     Rushes forward, deflecting with his hands bolt after bolt of energy thrown at him by his 
opponent. And then:

SUPERMAN
                    Stop! Stop! You win! I'll take you to her.

412     SUPERMAN

     Goes into the Metropolis Tower. Smiling wolfishly, NUCLEAR MAN follows.

413     IN THE LOBBY

The CROWD screams and scatters but NUCLEAR MAN can find neither SUPERMAN nor 
LACY. He turns to see:

413A     P.O.V. ELEVATOR DOORS

     The doors close on SUPERMAN. NUCLEAR MAN unleashes a raging torrent of flame 
which engulfs the elevator doors. Then looks up and:

414     NUCLEAR MAN

     Takes off, straight up, without thought and crashes up through the ceiling of the lobby.

415     FASTER AND FASTER

He moves up, through every floor, crashing through as startled EXECUTIVES,
SECRETARIES, CLEANERS etc. look on.

SUPERMAN surreptitiously checks the elevator doors behind him - but NUCLEAR MAN 
notices. He lunges at SUPERMAN, felling him with a tremendous blow. SUPERMAN 
cannot get up to stop him. 

                    SUPERMAN 
       (groggy)
No! Don't go in there! She's not in there!

     But NUCLEAR MAN wrenches the doors apart to find NOTHING !

418     SUPERMAN RISES

     It was a trick! He shoves NUCLEAR MAN into the elevator and quickly slams the door shut 
behind him.

419     SUPERMAN'S FIST

     Slams through the control panel on the exterior wall, shorting out the electric circuits.

420     INSIDE THE ELEVATOR

     All goes black. NUCLEAR MAN slowly collapses, his strength is gone. 

421     EXT. TOP OF METROPOLIS TOWER

     SUPERMAN appears above the observation deck. With X-RAY VISION he looks inside and 
discovers the elevator cable. He plunges his arms through the metal housing and wrenches 
out the cable and bodily pulls the elevator and its occupant up into the sky.

422     SUPERMAN IS AIRBORNE

     Over Metropolis. He carries behind the elevator car, NUCLEAR MAN'S coffin, stretched 
down from the ends of the cable.

Cold white orb of the night. Pockmarked and forgotten. SUPERMAN continues on his flight.

424     AROUND THE MOON'S EQUATOR

424A     INT. ELEVATOR

SNAP OPEN.  But the beam swings erratically away - and he is still again.

425     THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON

     SUPERMAN lands in a deep crater with the NUCLEAR MAN in tow. Sets him down into a 
dark recess. Mission accomplished, off he goes.

releases an energy bolt of his own which, in turn, knocks NUCLEAR MAN over.

428C     NUCLEAR MAN

     Leaps to his feet and sends bolt after bolt of nuclear energy at SUPERMAN.

428D     MEDIUM SHOT: SUPERMAN

     They trade punches until NUCLEAR MAN collapses into the moondust and SUPERMAN 
turns away and goes to straighten the American flag which has been knocked over in the 
titanic struggle.

428H     SUPERMAN.AND AMERICAN FLAG

     As SUPERMAN raises the flag, we notice NUCLEAR MAN once more behind him. It is:
     TOO LATE and NUCLEAR MAN seizes him in a massive bearhug before smashing him 
down into the moon rock and burying him completely. NUCLEAR MAN looks down at what 
he has done and then up towards the EARTH.

     He lights what seems to be a victory cigar. A nervous JIMMY OLSEN is joined by LOIS 
LANE as: 

437     WARFIELD'S LIMO PULLS UP

     LOIS looks worried.

                         LOIS
                    Mr. White, are you sure you know what 
you are doing? Here comes Warfield.

     WARFIELD storms up to PERRY.

                         WARFIELD
                    You'd better have a good explanation, White, or 
you'll be talking to your lawyers from jail.

     PERRY winks at LOIS and JIMMY

                         PERRY
                    You know, I'm not a tycoon. I'm just an old reporter. 
But I've read enough in my own paper the last few years 
about hostile takeover of companies. You must have been 
asleep at the wheel Warfield, because I managed to convince 
the Bankers of this city that the Daily Planet should be 
treated like a natural resource . . .Protected from predators. 
They lent me the money, I bought all the outstanding shares, 
and you, my friend are now the minority shareholder.

     WARFIELD'S jaw drops.

     Dropping the latest stack of dailies. JIMMY tears off the top copy.

conference.

442     EXT. ON THE STREET  -  A TAXI PULLS UP

     CLARK and LACY are in the back. Her luggage is piled around them. CLARK opens the 
door, but he doesn't move.

                    LACY
               Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other 
companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll 
take some time off.
      (a wry smile)
 I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the
country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow 
lane is like.

CLARK
                    I'm sorry to see you go.

                         LACY
                    You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty 
good idea of how you feel about me.

     CLARK 
I'm not so sure you do.

     LACY
Any more like you back home, Clark?

     CLARK
Like me?

     LACY
You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue 
eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old
fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on 
the night before their prom.

     LACY leans over and wraps her arms around CLARK. She holds on tight as they kiss. Then 
CLARK steps outside and closes the door. She leans out the window.

                    CLARK
               You'll find a good man Lacy. You deserve one.

                         LACY 
Maybe if you'd have met who I am now, instead of the 
spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have 
been different between us.

CLARK
                    Lacy. . . I . . . 

     She puts her finger to his lips.
 
LACY
                    No. Don't answer. I want to consider the possibilities.

     CLARK laughs with her.

                         CLARK
                    If you get to Smallville, I know a real estate agent . . .

available. Tell him you know me.

     She reaches up and touches his face. The taxi pulls away.

LACY 
       (leaning out)
Say goodbye to Superman for me.

A multitude has assembled. CLARK starts working his way through the crowd.

443     THE FRONT OF THE CROWD  -  LOIS AND JIMMY

CLARK pushes his way up front. JIMMY notices him first. He smiles. Nudges LOIS.

LOIS starts when she sees CLARK, then regains her composure, changing her tender smile 
into an impish grin.

                    JIMMY
               Hi Mr. Kent. How do you feel?

CLARK
                    It's a beautiful day, Jimmy.

                    It must have been a super effort to get out of 
bed, Clark.

     CLARK
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .
         (slightest smile)
. . . and all because I had a visit from a very 
good nurse.

JIMMY
                    She must have had some strong medicine. Lois said 
you were really ill.

     CLARK 
       (looking at LOIS)
Well Jimmy, sometimes a little loving care is the 
best medicine.

     LOIS 
        (softly)
I'm glad you're here.

And don't forget I'm covering Superman's press conference. 
You just tape reactions from people in the crowd.
