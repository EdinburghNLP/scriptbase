          FADE IN:
          BLACK. It's everywhere. It swallows the screen. And so we stare
          into a sea of BLACK.

          NARRATOR (V.0.)
          I saw a severed head once. Except for the,
          paleness, it looked healthy, well-fed.
          The end came abruptly you could tell
          'cause the mouth froze in mid-sentence.
          "Shh.  ," the curled lips attempted. Like
          it started saying "shucks" or "Shirley"
          or... "shit happens." Your eyes don't
          forget things like that. Like you don't
          forget the sound animals make when
          they're humping. Primal.
          Raw. They endure
          in you forever because the senses have a
          brain all their own and they recall long
          after you've succumbed to the la-la of
          forgetfulness.
          (a pregnant beat)
          Sometimes when it's dark out,-so dark
          it's black, I'll see HIM.

          (BEAT)
          And it starts all over again.
          From this blackness, a streak of LIGHTNING splits the night sky.

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

           We are in the eye of a STORM, an angry mass of clo uds raging
          o f a howling WIND. across the black sky..It brings RAIN and THUNDER an d the swirl
          An ENTITY emerges from this moist darkness.
          weather and advances into our scope of visibilityies through the
          A FLASH, of lightning erupts and it illuminates the sky. We SEE
          the approaching entity as it hovers before us.
          It's a man.
          It's a man, plus.
          It's a SUPERHERO,
          garbed in an elastic dark-grey outfit - a faded RED CAPE extends b
          ehind him, thrashing against the wind and rain.
          This Superhero (30). Unshaven.
          Disheveled. Worn. A face
          chiselled with mileage.
          

          

          2.
          In the eyes, we can see his soul. Intense. Fierce. An exposed
          nerve, snagged in a fish hook.
          He hangs in the air, tired, rain-soaked, pissed-off.
          He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated
          visage of SHEEPSHEAD BAY, a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood.
          And from the bowels of his very soul, this Superhero belches a
          thunderous ROAR. He pivots in the air and dives toward land.
          He slices through the downpour, arms extended, body erect,
          engulfed in the dimensions of his cape.
          The ground approaches, fast. He accelerates as if to embrace it.
          Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is IMPACT.
          An EXPLOSION as he rips through the street surface, penetrating
          the asphalt - head first. Debris and concrete spew from the
          ruptured orifice as he disappears inside.
          There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches
          nearby manhole LIDS from their spots - they bounce and CLANG
          down the street like loose change.
          The rain continues its onslaught.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Rain sloshes against a kitchen window. Where the sink is. Not
          far from the kitchen table. Where the LONGFELLOW Family sits,
          dinner before them.
          HORUS (35) leans over his plate, eating his meal. Here idles a
          man of diminutive frame, bespectacled, placid - as harmless as
          low fat milk.
          He sits opposite MARY (30), frenetically appropriating food. A
          gentle beauty. entwined in maternal angst she is estrogen with an
          attitude.
          A meek little AARON (8), slouches between the folks - a BLACK
          EYE tattoos the left of his face. Aaron stares at the damn
          plate, finding no humor in eggplant.

          MARY
          The principal did'nothing. Like
          schoolyard terrorism is no worse than
          being tardy. What's the matter with
          education? Back when, you could go to
          school and learn about Betsy Ross and...
          mollusks and... not get stabbed on the
          way home.

          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

          A subway TRAM idles by a passenger ramp. STEAM hisses from its
          side and plumes into a wall of white mist.
          And from this cloud of angry vapors, a figure appears. He
          surfaces from the dark subway tunnel, a cool nonchalance in his
          gait.
          It is the Superhero, his identity safely concealed under the
          collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT. He traverses the loading deck,
          PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him.
          He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway. He
          strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE, up against the grafetti-
          raped subway wall.
          On the wall, a line of profanity declares that...

          "YOUR MOTHER TAKES IT UP THE ASS."
          He surveys the machine. His right arm appears from the coat
          pocket. Fingers merge into a tight fist. And casually, he rips
          into the metal vendor like it was Jello.
          His fist withdraws a handful of bills, coins. He pockets the
          loot. He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY STRIKE.
          Deposits it under his coat.
          And with that, he heads for the stairs - to the flooded streets
          above.
          At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram closes its doors.
          Trembles. Moves. Steams into the deep dark tunnel. White SMOKE
          mushrooms from its tail. It lingers in the air as we...

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          see STEAM, rising from a faucet of running HOT water.
          It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits
          another set of pots. She's clearing the table.
          Down a dark hallway, a streak of light escapes from an open
          door. Inside and on the bed, the frail posture of Horus changes
          out of his clothes.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Horus disrobes down to his t-shirt and briefs. He stands before
          the closet mirror, scrutinizing the emaciated, sand-kicked-in-
          the-face body.


          5.
           Horns strikes
           a He-man pose, his
           biceps in the
           wind.

           He removes the Police apparel,
           plastic. Proceeds to put it on.

   
          INT. RED


          EYE MOTEL - NIGHT

          FISH
          How the fuck can I help you sir?


           SUPERHERO
          A room.
     

          

          6.
          His blood-shot eyes mean it.
          Fish turns to the back wall. Grabs a random KEY from a nail.

          FISH
          Top floor, 7F. Fifteen a pop, up front.
          (re: the check-in sheet)
          And your John Hancock makes it sweet.
          The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet. Scribbles

          HANCOCK
          on the dotted line.
          Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's
          grab.

          FISH (CONT'D)
          I don't take messages, I don't do favors,
          and I don't know you from Jack. You want
          sheets, they're extra. Towel's extra.
          Plunger's extra.

          HANCOCK
          I need quiet. Is it quiet?

          FISH
          Quiet? Hey pal, we look like a public
          library to you? The girls work. Some of
          them scream, some of them moan...

          (SMILES)
          and some of them just kinda lay there
          cold. You want quiet, I got cotton balls
          you can stick in your ear. They're extra.

          Hancock eyes Fish, mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare
          hands. He withdraws from his coat the WAD of loot. Pushes it
          under the window.

          And while Fish collects, he leans into the window and emits a
          deep GROWL. Fish recoils. The bills fly.

          Hancock takes the key. Exchanges it with a metal ORB - the
          strangulated remains of the bell. It rolls out of his palm and
          CLINKS off the counter.
          Hancock sidles off. Fish - the cat's got his tongue.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Horus, in full uniform - dark blue pants, shirt.

          

          

          

          

          7.
          He dips into a dresser, pulls out a thick black leather belt -
          complete with holster.

          Horus returns to the dresser for one final item - It's obscured
          by his arm but we feel it to be some heavy chunk of metal.
          He confronts the mirror, twirls this piece, holsters it. And we
          SEE it to be a FLASHLIGHT.
          A shoulder patch reads...

          U-RENT SECURITY CO.
          Their motto: "TO OBSERVE AND RECORD"
          Horus tucks a hat under his arms, ready to move.

          INT. AARON'S ROOM - NIGHT

          A jar of MARBLES rests upon a window ledge. Outside, the story
          is rain.
          On a bed, sprawled on his back, Aaron gazes up at the empty
          ceiling - the black eye squats prominently on his face.
          Aaron brings his hand before his eyes. Looks at it. Studies it.
          Slowly, his fingers converge into a tight FIST - a boy's
          interpretation of a man's weapon.
          A gentle KNOCK disperses the knuckles. Horus peers in.

          HORUS
          How's the eye?

          AARON
          Black.
          Horus enters.
          Stands awkwardly before his son.

          HORUS
          It'll be gone in a week. Mom'11 touch it
          up with some make-up and you won't even
          know it's there.

          AARON
          Yeah I will. And I don't want any girly
          make-up on my face.
          Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13 knees.

          

          

          

          

          B.

          HORUS
          (almost apologetically)
          There'll always be people around
          who'll... exert force over those of us
          who just want to live in peace.
          Aaron listens, observing his father's efforts.

          HORUS (CONT' D)
          (pain in every word)
          The thing to do is... to avoid them.
          They're no-wins. Can't-wins. You hold the
          anger... and move on. You hold the anger.
          (turns to Aaron)
          I tell you because I can't take it,
          seeing you hurt. You're part of me.

          (BEAT)
          I've felt what you're feeling now. And if
          you've got any of me in you, you're gonna
          feel what I felt-when you go up against
          one of 'em. Turn away... that's what you
          do... the other cheek. You do that for
          me. No, you're not the coward. Not you.
          No. I'll be the coward, all right? 'Cause
          I don't want to see you hurt. I love you.
          I ask you to do that for me... your old
          man.
          And while he utters these words, Mary watches from the dark
          hallway - moved b y his affection.
          She oversees a father-son embrace.

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          I'm late for work. Get some sleep.
          Tomorrow always feels better...

          AARON
          .after a good night sleep.
          The light FLICKS off and the man's silhouette form exits the
          room.

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Horus backs his way out. Shuts the door. Mary's hand greets him
          from behind.
          It startles the man. He.tries to regroup.

          HORUS
          Mary.

          

          

          

          

          9.
           Mary inches closer - passion oozes from every pore. She nestles
          up against her husband.
           Horus stands uncoordinated, pressing his hands against her back.
          He is gentle, but as effective as an armless masturbator.
           Mary caresses his neck. Moves her lips to his ear, enraptured

          BY
          the moment.
          And out of nowhere...

          HORUS (CONT'D)

          (AWKWARD)
          I'm late.
          Mary snaps from her trance. Unshackles her hold, like she almost
          expected it.

          MARY

          (DISAPPOINTED)
          Right.

          (BEAT)
          Coffee's by the door.
           She marches back into the kitchen. Horus stares at his feet.
          S hakes his fists, mentally kicking himself in the face.
           He settles for the door, grabs hisjac ke , coffee thermos. A
           look at Mary and he's out thedoo rt

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Mary - against
          the kitchen sink.
          Her thin cotton
          dress clings to a body still'robust with enrgy,
          to breasts so ful l they could yread Uncl
           pop a boner inoud e
           And while the storm rages outside, Mary burns in a feverish
          sweat. The swelling steam and running ho t water combine to
          saturate her chest and face - she drips.
           Mary gazes out at the wet abyss, possessed by some inner
          longing.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM (7F) - NIGHT

          A T.V. SET. It MOANS from the corner of a room. Scant
          blinking red neon from the street cannot disguise thecant lighting

          caught dead here.
          On a shredded s, blotched with urine and cum, we SEE a
          trenehc -lï¿½n open carton of cigarettes accompanies the
          picture.
          An open door faces the MOANING TV set. It's the bathroom and
          it's occupied by the intensely frazzled image of Hancock.
          He squats on the TOILET, pants around the ankles, cape shrouded
          around him.
          Those unforgiving eyes plant on the TV screen, a cigarette
          dangling from the corner of his lip.
          We discern the MOANS to be human and we SEE that he is watching
          a PORNO flick - flashes of flesh upon flesh in a fucking frenzy.

          T.V. SET (O.S.)

          (FEMALE)
          Ooh yeah, big fella. That's it. Shoot
          your load, baby. Let it fly... FLY...!
          (male; in ecstasy)
          fly. YES! G0000D!
          Hancock absorbs the action from the can, a glint of pain on his
          face.
          He takes a long hard drag on the cigarette - a full stick
          deteriorates into ashes before our eyes.
          And outside, it rains like there's no tomorrow.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. SHEEPSHEAD BAY - DAY

          Morning brings a cease-fire on precipitation. The streets
          glimmer from puddles left behind from the night.
          The overcast sky - its precarious rain formation indicates that
          the storm is far from over.

          An ASHTRAY buried under a mountain of butts.
          A bed unslept. The TV is on, commercialing some spring-fresh
          vaginal wash. The room sits empty.
          But the bathroom door is open. Inside, the supersuit peeled down
          to his waist, Hancock shaves.

          HANCOCK
          (mumbling; rehearsing)
          it's about responsibility... with
          what is empowered in you... to correct
          the ills of man.
          No foam. No gel. Just skin and the razor edge of his belt BUCKLE
          - it slices through stubble, clearing up a face that has yet to
          sleep.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (AGAIN)
          it's about responsibility...
          Hancock reaches into the cabinet below the sink - pulls out a
          BOTTLE of 409 all-purpose cleaner...
          On the tube, the commercial segues way into...

          T.V. (O.S.)

          (FAINTLY)
          And on the world front, heavy fighting
          continues in Angola as rebel forces
          storm... regime... under the military
          stronghold...
          The SOUND of machine guns CRACKLE amidst mortar explosions and
          civil destruction.
          Hancock listens - it disturbs him. He whirls around, accosts the
          TV Rips it from the wall, throws it out the window. And a CRASH
          eradicates images of war and chaos.
          He returns to the bathroom. To the mirror. Proceeds to spray his
          teeth with 409...

          EXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - DAY

          Behold this imposing, block-long behemoth of commerce and
          decadence. A shopper's wet dream, this is WATANABE'S SHOPPING

          EMPORIUM.
          From the street, notice the display windows - all mannequins
          come complete with outfit and ultra-erect nipples.
          As EMPLOYEES file into the service entrance, out comes Horus and
          Roheim. They head streetward, to the sidewalk.
          Roheim unscrews the battery cap from his flashlight. Takes a
          swig from its hollow interior.

          ROHEIM
          I'll just play out the rest of this Eight
          Ball...
          He laps up the last drop. Reloads it with a couple of batteries
          from his jacket.

          ROHEIM (CONT' D)
          (caps it)
          like that.
          Horus looks on - silent.

          

          

          

          

          14.
          A POLICE VEHICLE enters this urban landscape. It slows in front
          of them. The cops: RUTGER and ADAMS, two hairy-knuckled
          testosterone cases with nothing to do.

          RUTGER.
          (passenger seat)
          Boys...
          The cops smile at one another. A large SHOTGUN rests fully erect
          between them. And they drive off.
          Horus, watching them go, focuses in on the

          "TO SERVE AND PROTECT"
          of their vehicle.
          Roheim watches him - turning red with drama.

          ROHEIM
          Bastards... couldn't protect a pitcher of
          warm spit... couldn't find their
          asshole with common sense and a thumb.

          (BEAT)
          Like I been saying, it's their.loss. The
          jerk-offs, they don't got the heart...
          the sensitivity of a man like you.
          Horus tries to shrug off these words. No good - they stick like
          a thorn in the eye of his soul.

          ROHEIM (CONT'.D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Come on, let's go home.

          EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

          On the rooftop; the Red Eye Motel.
          A trenchcoated figure - we see him from the back, only. We
          recognize the broad of his shoulders and the red of his cape,
          peering out from a hole in his coat.
          A cloud of smoke lingers above his head, from an unseen
          cigarette. He stands before the Sheepshead neighborhood, ever so
          still.
          Something brews within this superman.

          The streets of Sheepshead: apartments, brownstones speckled with
          e DELIS and NEWSSTANDS and BARBER SHOPS and OUTDOOR MARKETS - they
          are the "esque" in Bro ly qu
          Through this hustle-bustle, we spot Mary and Aaron on their way

          TO

          BRADLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
          Schoolyard activities abound. Buses, bouncing balls, and hoards
          of screaming little anti-christs.

          Mary leads Aaron along the playground fence, the latter trying
          to pull ahead and away.

          MARY
          Will you slow down.

          AARON
          I know it. I know it.

          MARY
          I think I'm... slow down... I'm gaining
          weight. Honey, take a look at my waist.

          AARON
          What?

          MARY
          Is my dress too tight?

          AARON
          What? Nothing. It's fine.

          MARY
          Really, my waist isn't too big?

          AARON
          What? Not here, mom.

          MARY
          All right, already. Two-thirty. You do n't
          leave the building till then. I'll be
          there.

          AARON
          I know it, mom. Can I go now?

          MARY
          Give me a kiss, you snot.

          AARON
          (there is no god)
          Geez!
          He turns back. Plants a kiss on Mary's smiling cheeks.

          MARY
          Two-thirty.

          AARON
          All right, mom.
          He leaves, merging into the undulating sea of children.

          MARY
          (after him; in vain)
          You want anything from the store?
          He's gone.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          This is the Longfellow's street - lower-middle class but
          comfortable, quaint, safe. Mr. Longfellow, hustling through the
          street, takes us home.
          Greeting him at the entrance, at the mailboxes, is CLYDE BANNER
          (35). Quite large this tenant is, quite simply a Cro-Magnon Man.
          Clyde stands with the morning paper in hand, searching
          carelessly through. He finds the SPORTS PAGE. Hides it under his
          robe.

          Clyde shoves the remains of the paper at Horus - in his face.

          CLYDE
          Picked this up for you.
          (pulls the paper back)
          Say thanks.

          HORUS
          Thanks.

          CLYDE
          (hands it over)

          He heads inside.
          Horus swallowing it. He unshuffles the paper, finding the front
          page. The headline reads...

          RAINSTORM HITS SHEEPSHEAD. NO END IN SIGHT.
          Horus checks the sky - a sinewy mesh of angry clouds. He lumbers
          inside.

          INT. NICK'S MARKET - DAY

          Mary moves through the street, embracing a grocery bag.
          She continues her way, purpose in every step. No window shopping
          bullshit for this woman - Mary's strong, beautiful.
          She crosses the street, her destination: CENTRAL FIDELITY BANK.
          A dark CHEVY eases pass Mary on this street, pulls to a stop.
          Mary continues forth, entering the bank.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Sheepshead DENIZENS crisscross amok. People queue behind teller
          lines, taking care of business.
          Mary takes her place. She glances at the bank CLOCK - it's 10
          o'clock.

          A BEE spirals the air and lands on the sleeve of a nervous ARM.
          This arm protrudes from the dark Chevy, parked before the bank.
          The engine is running.
          The arm fidgets. SHOOS the insect away. With white knuckles, it
          grips the wheel.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Same bank, same people. Mary awaits service in the same line.
          A MAN ambles pass Mary's line, up towards the front. He cuts off
          the person in front, an elderly WOMAN.

          WOMAN
          Hey, what's the idea?
          The man turns. Smiles. His smile fades, turning into a maniacal.
          grin. This man is TOM (35), as plainly evil as the eye can see.

          TOM
          You know what, you remind me of my
          grandma.
          Tom whips out a sawed-off SHOTGUN from his pants...

          Thanks, Granny!
          Of course, by now, people have realized the implications of the
          situation at hand. They begin to panic.
          On cue, two new GUNMEN, JERRY and JERRY (30's), emerge from the
          crowded bank, both revealing automatic RIFLES.
          Jerry #1 drops the SECURITY GUARD with the butt of his gun.
          As planned, they take aim at the surveillance CAMERAS on each
          end of the bank. BANG. BANG. They miss, much to Tom's chagrin.
          The crowd ducks, Mary among them. Terror grips,the queues.
          The Jerrys try again. BANG. BANG. No more cameras. And with
          ,Irâ–º that, Tom takes center stage. He leaps on the teller counter.

          Lips, legs, lungs - stuff prepubescent wet dreams are made of.
          Aaron, nestled mid-room, tries to keep his eyes straight.
          He steals a quick look to the back of the room: there, in the
          back, a BLONDE boy (8) sits chewing gum.
          This kid, from the slicked-back hair and rolled-up t-shirt
          sleeves, is a sub-species of vermin.

          And on this cue, the sky answers with a thunderous surprise - a
          CAR comes CRASHING down before the bank entrance.
          It came from the clouds and it looks familiar - it's the getaway
          Chevy, bruised and punctured beyond recognition, its hubcaps
          still reeling from the impact.
          The sky answers again, this time with the tattered body of FRED,
          the getaway driver (alias, the arm.) Fred lands on the hood of
          the Chevy, sinking into its metal frame.
          SHOCK waves across faces of stone. The cops all look up.

          (at the sky)
          What the...

          

          

          

          

          25.
          There :;n the sky, a taped figure works his magic of flight. He
          examines the ground below. And he dives.
          Hancock approaches earth and swings lateral. He circumvents the
          bank structure, flying around and around.
          Everybody ducks. Trash and paper batter about behind his draft.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Tom and the Jerrys stand shackled in their spots.
          Their eyes wander about, lost in confusion. The WHIR outside
          subsides. Stops.
          A loaded beat.
          Tom, in mid-swallow, watches as a spectacular EXPLOSION of
          bricks sprays the air inside. A caped figure bursts into the
          scene amidst SCREAMS from clueless hostages.
          in the blink of an eye, Hancock has Jerry #2 by the collar. With
          a flick of the wrists, Jerry #2 is a human projectile en route
          to the windshield of a police vehicle outside.
          Jerry #1 opens FIRE on Hancock. Bullets careen off flesh of
          steel.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          Jerry #1 rides air and glass out and across the street into
          another awaiting police windshield.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Smoke and debris smother the air. And as they subside, all eyes
          fall on the caped figure that is Hancock, erect in the rubble.
          Mary can't believe her eyes. She surveys every inch of his
          frame, now clean-shaven, combed, comic book perfect.
          Hancock scans the crowd of stunned hostages - his eyes pick out
          the WOMEN - Veronica's wet smile takes him.
          A heartbeat.

          HANCOCK

          (GOD)
          Everybody out, please.
          Bodies bang about, all moving for the door.

          

          

          

          

          26.
          Mary follows the herd out but her eyes remain on the caped
          figure, until real estate ushers her into the street.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          PARAMEDICS converge on the hostages .
          The cops are at a loss - deers staring down a pair headlights.
          They train their guns on the bank, waiting for answers.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          The bank floor in shambles. No one in sight. But movement jars
          us to the back, where the bank SAFE is.
          We SEE Hancock wade through rubble towards the open safe, a
          thick steel chamber of commerce. Hancock arrives at the safe.
          Confronts the object inside - Tom.

          INT. BANK SAFE - DAY

          There he is, in the corner, a sweaty piece of misery. Tom bears
          his revolver, aimed at Hancock. Hancock enters the safe.

          TOM
          Stay away.
          Hancock does not respond.

          TOM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          I'm not going back.
          Hancock turns, grabs the safe door. Slams it shut with a
          resounding THUD. They're locked in.

          TOM (CONT'D)

          (HYSTERICAL)
          What're you doing?
          Hancock does not respond.

          TOM (CONT'D)
          What's going on, here?
          Hancock no response. Tom raises his gun, and meaning it.

          TOM (CONT'D)
          Answer me! Say something!

          (FIRES)
          Fuck me!

          

          

          

          

          27.
          BANG! Tom fires a. shot off Hancock's forehead. The BULLET
          ricochets about the steel interior, under great velocity.
          It rips Tom's right EAR from his head.

          HANCOCK
          (catching the renegade slug)
          Why'd you go and do that for?
          Tom retrieves his ear from the ground. Tries to put it back,
          clutching his head. He bleeds.

          TOM
          Fuck... My shirt.

          HANCOCK
          (steps forward)
          Why don't we call it the day.

          TOM
          (gun raised)
          Don't. I told you... I'm not going back.

          HANCOCK

          (IRRITATED)
          If you're going to tease, cock the damn
          gun. Otherwise, spare me the wounded
          animal act of desperation. I don't got c,
          time for rhetoric and sympathy so. don't
          expect... dialogue and "come with me and
          you won't be hurt" bullshit. You walk out
          of here with me and your life is a
          violent storm. You will be hurt, you will
          be abused... whatever turns them on.
          Either way, your days are shit! Those are
          the realities, spelled out.

          TOM
          What's eating you, man?

          HANCOCK

          (UPSET)
          You got half the precinct out there,
          armed, trained to blow the tail off a
          sperm from a hundred yards... you're
          standing in here, cornered, three bullets
          left in that squirter of yours, if you're
          lucky, and you got one ear. I don't need
          the aggravation. I don't need this.

          TOM
          Man, you're jaded. I'm not asking for a
          rainbow...

          you don't got to shower me with respect.
          Just a little.. tenderness, is all. Have
          you no mercy, mister?

          HANCOCK
          (he's had enough)
          I'm all out. Let's go...
          And as he utters this, he approaches Tom.

          TOM

          (HURT)
          Fuck you.
          Close on his trigger finger. It tightens...

          HANCOCK

          NO!

          INT. BANK - DAY

          On the bank floor, where a group of cops now huddle, we hear
          THREE SHOTS - from the safe.

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          The schoolyard - it looms in the background, as a reference to
          where we are.
          Aaron occupies this alley and we see what he sees - trash and
          fire-escapes and ominous gray skies. DARK FIGURES move into this
          sight - they eclipse the heavens.
          And there Aaron is, twisted in a contorted heap of arms and legs
           - his body eternally locked within the stranglehold of SPENGLER
          and ERLICK (both his age.)
          Aaron's face, another BLACK EYE makes it a set. Rage distorts
          his mouth out of symmetry. He stares at PERCEVAL, before him -
          the blonde kid from class.
          We HEAR water, a stream of liquid-something SPLASHING about,
          SPRAYING. Perceval - he's taking a leak on Aaron's exposed leg.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          The aftermath.
          Hancock is swarmed under MEDIA LIGHTS, reporters squeezing
          through a wall of people, police, trying to get a piece of this
          superman.

          

          

          

          

          29.
          We follow Hancock's scope amidst the melee it spots luscious
          Veronica again, it spots WOMEN, all who'd die for a chance to
          suck on his cape.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Mary hastens after Aaron, urine-soaked and on the verge of
          tears. He rages down the street while his mother pursues.

          MARY
          Tell me... what happened?

          AARON
          (about to break)
          You were late.

          MARY
          I was held up...

          AARON
          The asshole peed on me. I'm dog shit.

          MARY
          .at the bank. Honey, were they the same
          ones? Don't cry.

          AARON
          Get a grip, mom.
          They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the
          stairs.

          EXT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The door SLAMS to signify arrival. School books go flying.
          Mother and son march down the hallway. They are greeted by
          Horus, sleep still on his face.

          HORUS
          How was your day?
          Mother and son - if eyes could disembowel.

          EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          Just your average professional building, several stories of

          30.
          But all is not well with this typically normal picture. On the
          top floor, outside and on the ledge - a JUMPER stands poised
          before blood and concrete. His TIE flaps in the wind.
          From an adjacent window, a SECRETARY, a FIREMAN attempt to get
          him down.

          JUMPER'

          (SELF-PITY)
          People ignore me.
          From his vantage - a congregation of PEOPLE swarm below in his
          honor. A woman cradling a BABY watches from a building window
          across the street.

          FIREMAN
          Mr. Fisher.

          SECRETARY
          (through her teeth)
          You're not unattractive.

          FIREMAN
          Baldness is not fatal.

          JUMPER
          My wife ignores me.

          FIREMAN
          Your wife's a cunt, Mr. Fisher.

          SECRETARY
          We like you, Mr. Fisher. The girls
          acknowledge you, we all do.

          JUMPER
          No.

          SECRETARY
          Yes.

          JUMPER
          Really?
          The secretary SCREAMS. All attention shifts to the BUILDING
          across the street. The secretary points...

          EXT. OPPOSITE BUILDING - DAY

          There...

          

          

          

          

          31.
          on the top floor, outside and on the ledge - the baby seen
          earlier, diaper-clad, crawls precariously on the rim of doom.
          His mother's FREAKING from the window.
          Below, the crowd makes its way across the street. They point and
          gasp at the infant's every movement - leaving the jumper by his
          lonesome.
          The baby teeters along the edge. It heads for a FLAG pole,
          dazzled by the red-white-and-blue. It reaches out at fabric.
          Almost. Not quite. The baby DROPS from the precipice.
          On the street, people CHOKE on their tongues as gravity pulls
          the infant down.
          But wait... Hancock swoops out of the thin blue, swift and
          silent. He cradles the baby from utter concrete.
          He deposits the youngster with.the ecstatic crowd - they, of
          mostly the FEMALE persuasion, all form around the savior.
          We SEE in the background and across the street, the Jumper nose-
          diving into the sidewalk - without much fanfare.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          An apartment building engulfed in FLAMES. FIRE TRUCKS don't even
          bother with the hoses - it's too late. Around them, TENANTS
          bemoan the loss of...
          Like a wrecking ball, Hancock BURSTS through the burning rubble
          and surfaces clean on the other side of the building.
          Blanketed under his cape are two little TODDLERS, and a young
          WOMAN in bra and panties. He lowers them to safety.

          We're in the hallway. Where Horus kneels. He's bent listening
          into Aaron's bedroom, in his security clothes. By the TV and in
          her apron, Mary watches the news...

          NEWS
          . paramedics have taken the rescued
          tenants to County General for smoke

          We see FOOTAGE of the dramatic fire rescue: Hancock recovering
          tenants from the pyre - plebs and dwellers cheer in exaggerated
          astonishment.

          HORUS

          Mary?
          Mary blinks back her attention.

          HORUS (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Why is he mad at me?

          MARY
          He's looking for answers. He's Upset.

          HORUS
          (tapping the door)
          Let me see your eye...
          (to Mary)
          I told him about the other cheek. Avoid
          confrontations... to turn the other
          cheek.

          MARY
          .He did. He turned the other cheek and
          they punched it.

          MARY
          You're late. I'll try again later.
          Horus finds his hat on the table. His eyes fall on Mary, her
          back to him. She's glued to the set.

          HORUS '
          How... what about you?

          MARY

          (ALOOF)

          what I'd do... if you...
          Mary does not hear him... until the door SHUTS behind her. She
          turns to face an empty room.

          INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

          A room, a place we don't know. It's dark save the street light
          outside. A rhythmic POUNDING reverberates through this darkness.
          More intense it becomes.
          And then a high-pitch GASP. Two individuals, man and woman,
          stumble into view - their silhouettes obscure the window.
          They're locked at the hips, pumping away like high-revving
          pistons.
          For a second, light dances off the woman's aroused face: it's
          Veronica.

          VERONICA
          (a her voice trembles)
          Oh god.
          The man surfaces from her cleavage for air, his face wet with
          sweat and saliva. He brushes his cape away from his arm.
          Veronica uncoils yet another orgasm, her back arched, her
          breasts beckoning at ceiling.
          Quite abruptly, he lets her go. Rights his pants. Unlatches the
          window. She paws after him.

          Horus. His walk. Unaware of everything but the storm inside his
          head.
          He crosses an alley. A band of THUGS, neighborhood kids of
          malcontent, surprises him. And. versa. They recoil at his
          uniform, his gun.
          They quickly realize that he's rent-a-security.
          The leader speaks first - he's SCARPO (25), as tough as a steel-
          belted radial. The others regroup their DRUGS.

          SCARPO
          Nutri-cop.
          Horus keeps walking.

          Shit, ain't half the Man.

          A slight drizzle shimmers pass the streetlight. Pelts a soulful
          Hancock below - he moves through the gray dreariness in
          solitude.

          Taps himself a stick.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          How about spreading some of that joy?
          Hancock turns and faces a young HOODLUM, scraggly in his own
          slimy kind of way.
          In a huff, he shoves Hancock up against the building. Presses a
          gun to Hancock's temple.

          HOODLUM

          (PSYCHOTIC)
          Better yet, why don't I just take it...
          Hancock - enraged. In a caffeinated blink, he has the Hoodlum by
          the throat via one arm, the gun with the other.

          HANCOCK

          (SUPER-PSYCHOTIC)
          What are you thinking?
          The Hoodlum notices that he's dangling a foot off the ground -
          one of his SNEAKERS remains in its spot from the swift jolt.
          The other sneaker teeters on his one foot... and falls to the
          pavement.

          HOODLUM
          (fuck me)
          Shit...

          HANCOCK
          What are you thinking?!
          Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own
          mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D )
          Huh?!
          Takes the smoking gun out of his mouth. Shoves it up the-
          Hoodlum's nose.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)
          Want to see brain? Huh?!
          Sticks the gun back into his mouth. FIRES another shot inside.
          Takes it out and this time - jams it into the Hoodlums mouth.
          The Hoodlum proceeds to urinate in his pants.

          

          

          

          

          36.

          HOODLUM
          (with his mouth full)
          Please, mister. I got a baby coming.., a
          wife. I got student loans...
          Hancock - intense.
          Is this getting through?

          HOODLUM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          please. Have a heart, mister.
          Hancock - the fire inside subsides. Cools to a rational state.
          He lowers the. Hoodlum.
          He spits the three SLUGS into his hand. Deposits them in the
          Hoodlum's breast pocket. Walks away.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          In the closing hours of business, employees pell-mell about in
          preparation for departure.
          A group of LADIES form around a display T.V., taking in with
          frothy wetness every inch of Hancock's footage. They gasp
          amongst themselves.
          Horus enters the picture, jacket and thermos. He notices the TV -
          it's like he can't escape the good news.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The TV set.
          More news on the day's activities. Mary sits mesmerized on the
          sofa, holding a dish she had planned to dry.
          Aaron surfaces from the hallway, lured out by the TV He comes up
          behind Mary - his black eyes on the news.

          He rolls over the sofa, next to his mother.
          They watch VIDEO clips of the foiled bank heist: the crashing
          Chevy, the aerial maneuvers, the sheer invincibility of this

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          HADES - a smoky bar in the armpit of town.
          NEON beer signs. POOL tables. CIGARETTE machines. This is home
          to mean people, tough guys - children of a fucked-up god.
          We cut through the nicotine air to find the bar. A figure
          hunches on the far end, smoking. Popping vodka like mountain
          water in Dixie cups.
          It's Hancock and his trenchcoat. The long day wears heavy on his
          face - those perpetually red eyes, the horror they've seen.

          HANCOCK

          (MUTTERING)
          What he's got to do... a man's got to do
          it.

          EXT. BAR - NIGHT

          Hancock stumbles out, incognito, frazzled under his guise. Up
          above, the sky - so dark under the storm clouds.
          We HEAR commotion in the side alley. And so does Hancock. He
          peers into the alley.
          There, by a lighted PHONE BOOTH, a WHORE is fending off a horny
          JOHN. Hancock simply watches she drives her knee between his
          legs. He drops. SQUEALS like a little girl.
          The John finds a two-by-four in the dirt. He reaches for it...

          

          

          

          

          38.
          A COUGH stops him - it's Hancock and he discourages further
          violence.
          Up and out of the alley, the John flees - tail, between his
          legs.
          A long stare ensues - Hancock and the Whore, looking into each
          other's eyes for answers.
          The Whore approaches him. Touches his face - studies it. Moves
          it into the light.

          WHORE
          (the sage)
          You've been to Hell, it looks. And you're
          tired...

          (BEAT)
          and in need.
          Hancock - his eyes agree.
          The Whore lifts her skirt, reaching into her panties. She takes
          out a MATCHBOOK.
          Hands it to him.

          WHORE (CONY' D)
          My business card.
          (to the phone booth)
          My office.
          Hancock inspects the matchbook - 555-GINA, etched inside.

          HANCOCK

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

          From the black night - a dark figure plummets, caroms off the
          side of a building, strikes the metal fire-escapes, crashing
          into the trash cans below.
          Hancock stumbles from the wreckage, the garbage. Falls. He leans
          against the building, glazed over with drunkenness.
          He turns to the only source of light that of a building across
          the street: KILLYBEGS TEXTILES, looming above the rest. Boarded-
          up windows indicate abandonment - an urban relic.
          He stares at the building - perhaps sparing more attention than
          we think it deserves.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Mary swallows. Starts in on the tune.

          MARY
          "Once there was a way, to get back

          There, on his ass, his head a raging inferno - Hancock listens,
          as if he can hear.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Aaron, succumbing to his mother's song - his lids flutter.

          MARY

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          Something overcomes this fevered superman. He begins to unravel.
          A calm consumes him. Tames him. It could be Mary's voice - maybe
          he can hear it, and then maybe not.

          MARY (V.O.)
          "Golden slumber fills your eyes. Smiles
          awake you when you rise."
          Hancock wavers on consciousness - quite unlike him.

          (CONTINUING)
          "Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I

          Erratic traces of an urban landscape JAG about.
          Aaron's distorted view of his neighborhood comes sharp and in
          flashes as he is pursued by his tormentors.
          Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They chase him from behind, HOOTING,
          taunting poor Aaron - they're out for blood.
          Aaron cuts into an alley, lungs pumping...

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          .. but a brick wall stares him down, providing no exit. He
          swallows hard.
          FOOTSTEPS approach, just seconds away. Close on Aaron, as blood
          drains from his face. His eyes dash for a garbage CAN - but is
          there time?
          Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They can smell their prey.

          PERCEVAL
          (just arriving)
          Let's rock it up.
          They turn the corner, attack mode. Aaron, nowhere in sight. Just
          the brick wall and a trash can.
          They converge, baffled. Erlick inspects the solid wall. Spengler
          scratches his head. But'Perceval's no fool. He spots the trash
          can.
          He motions the fellas over. They circle the can. A beat. They
          ATTACK... an empty can. No one inside. Nothing.
          That's because above them, no strings and no cables, Aaron
          hovers - under Hancock's capable arm.
          In mid-air, they hang for a second. Then, Hancock takes them
          away.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          Mary stands at the designated pick-up spot, pacing like her

          A secluded view of the city, high above. Hancock, Aaron under
          his arms, rides a light breeze - and then lands.
          Aaron scampers away. Turns and faces the man.
          Hancock examines the boy's face, the black eyes. He shakes his
          head. Disappointed.
          He reaches for his belt. Pulls out a cigarette. Lights it.

          HANCOCK
          You smoke?

          AARON
          What?

          Of course you don't. Nothing but a kid.
          (beat; takes a puff)
          Smoke no evil.
          Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner.

          (re: cigarette)

          Go on... give it a try. One time. Won't
          kill you. Once.
          Aaron under pressure, acquiesces. He takes the stick. Sucks on
          it. Doubles over, coughing.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          Good, huh? Tastes like compost... your
          first stick. Then, after a few more... it
          starts getting this. flavor. A little
          nicotine buzz. A while passes and all of
          a sudden, it's as sweet as candy. Only
          now, it takes a whole pack to get
          there.., and you won't settle till your,
          mouth's as sweet.
          Hancock takes another cool drag - Mr. Wisdom waxing
          philosophical.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          From manure to pure cane sugar. That's

          AARON
          Principles?

          HANCOCK
          Principles. Here's one; very simple. Just
          about all you need to know: a man's got
          to do what a man's got to do.
          (beat; smokes)
          I look at your face, the shiners. You
          took a shove and you let it go clean. Not
          good. That's a formula for future
          abuse... an invitation to the loser's
          dance. Letting it go. Walking away.
          ,(shakes head)
          Bad policy. Won't be long 'fore you're
          running, looking for a place to hide.

          AARON
          What am I suppose to do?

          HANCOCK
          You do what is necessary.

          AARON
          I wanted... there were three of them.

          HANCOCK
          What is necessary.

          (HEAT)
          Let me tell you something, kid. There was
          this infantry unit, you see... badly
          outnumbered.
          (thinks about it)
          Wait, let me put it in kid terms. So you
          relate, OK? There's a fox, you relate? A
          fox and he's walking through what, the
          woods, the forests, right? Next thing the
          fox knows, he's staring down a pack of...
          hounds. Bloodhounds. And there's this
          chase, the fox's running his ass off,
          over boulders and through streams and,
          but the damn hounds are still on his
          tail. Finally the fox comes to this
          cliff, a precipice... and it's what, a
          seven hundred foot drop onto jagged
          rocks. He's in trouble 'cause the hounds
          are closing in and they're going to tear
          him to pieces. So what does he think...
          "I jump and I die for sure. I stay,
          confront them and I'll get my ass
          butchered." Decision time. He thinks,
          "stay and least I'd have something, a
          chance.

          go down fighting, make a stand. Right?

          The hounds come. What do you think
          happens?

          Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke.

          HANCOCK
          No. The fox gets his ass kicked and
          some... I mean ripped apart by the dogs,
          like cheap fabric.

          AARON
          What're you saying?

          HANCOCK
          But you know, when the last hound was
          through with him,-and he's walking away,
          he hears this noise. It's the fox and
          he's muttering something under his
          breath... words. The dog goes over. Gets
          up close. To hear what he's saying. You
          know what the fox's saying... just before
          he keels off?
          Aaron - negative.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Now he's gurgling, choking on his own 
          blood, right? A massacre. The fox's lying
          next to his entrails, you know... and you
          know what he says?
          (raises his fist in the air)
          "No regrets."

          AARON
          What?

          HANCOCK
          No regrets. You make a decision and you
          stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And
          "no regrets."
          Aaron - submitting it to memory.

          AARON
          Why're you telling me all this?

          

          

          

          

          45.

          HANCOCK
          (a beat to think)
          Look at it this way... I got to do what I
          got to do.

          As Dr. Hole proceeds to exhibit an enlarged PHOTOGRAPH of his
          hemorrhoidal tissues, the TV channel changes. A NEWS program, in
          progress.

          

          

          

          

          46.
          On the living room sofa squats. Hancock, remote in hand.

          REPORTER (O.S.)
          . more.on the neighborhood robberies in
          our next hour.

          (BEAT)
          World news, today. Hundreds are believed
          dead when an explosion ripped through a
          crowded market place in...
          Hancock staring into footages of bedlam, bloodshed. From the TV
          set, maternal CRIES spew forth grief and anguish.
          Hancock grabs the remote. Fumbles around for the power button.
          He pumps the volume instead - the WAILS intensify his state of
          panic, pain.
          CLICK. Mary - by the tube, switches off the mayhem. She studies
          his reaction, now marked with relief.

          MARY

          (SAVIOR)
          Are you OK?

          HANCOCK
          I'm sorry.

          MARY

          (NERVOUS)
          I came in to... hope you like chicken.
          Hancock nods, watching Mary as she retreats into the kitchen. He
          continues to stare - at Mrs. Longfellow, in frenetics, prepping
          for dinner.
          She catches him looking... looking surreal, this superman, there
          on her sofa.
          A calm, while they stare. And then...

          AARON (O:S.)
          Table's done.
          Mary turns to Aaron, offscreen.

          MARY
          Glasses.

          AARON (O.S.)
          Geez.
          Horus enters from the hallway, disheveled from sleep. He does
          not see the superman on his sofa. He continues into the kitchen.

          

          

          

          

          47.
          Mary stares at him. Aaron appears, also staring at him. Horus
          does a "what?" with his shoulders. Mother and son gesture behind
          him.
          He turns and beholds: Hancock,' rising in full garb, arm
          extended. All eyes on Horus - befuddled.

          MARY
          You know Hancock?

          AARON
          He comes for dinner.
          Close on Hancock. Close on Horus.

          HANCOCK
          Man of the house?

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Dinner is served. All the key players, present. Horus sits
          facing his son - dethroned by the distinguished visitor. Mary
          serves.

          MARY
          (to Hancock)
          Which piece would you like?

          HANCOCK
          Breasts, please.
          Horus, watching everything - Mary and her every blush.

          AARON
          You want milk?

          HANCOCK
          No. It gives me gas. Thank you.
          A beat - as everyone visualizes a superFART.

          AARON
          It makes mom fart, too.
          Mary CHOKES on her food.
          Drops her fork. She maneuvers, in the allotted space, for the
          utensil - and finding difficulty.
          Hancock grabs the table, one arm. Lifts it off the carpet and
          above everyone's head. Mary, startled, impressed, all of the
          above. She picks up the fork.

          

          

          

          

          48.
          Horus - a chicken leg dangling from his lips, in mid-chew,.
          looking impotent.

          AARON (CONT'D)
          Good arm.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Later.

          HANCOCK
          not about the labor... or the love of
          it.
          (beat; we've heard this before)
          .It's about responsibility... with what is
          empowered in you. The gift of might.
          Might to.do what? Exploitation, because
          you can? Or a different path. To purvey
          justice. To correct the ills of man...
          because I can.
          Faces of profound confusion - Mary and Aaron. But they are
          charmed, his words secondary to his charisma.
          Horus, the quiet observer, observes.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          so, a job? Yes. And no. It's about...
          essence. The essence of the man... not
          his clothes. It's the job. Take away the
          arm,. the leg..., his bodily possessions
          but not his trade, his profession. That
          case, you strip him of what he is... a
          man.
          Horus a firm grasp of the concept.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)
          What line of work are you in, Mr.
          Longfellow?

          HORUS
          (clearing throat)
          Oh, it's not like you... what you do or
          anything. A department store over on
          Third.

          MARY
          Horus is in the securities business.

          HORUS
          I'm a security guard. I'm just...

          

          

          

          

          49.
          Aaron rises from the table. Goes over to the fridge.

          MARY
          It's a large department store, over a
          couple million in merchandise... stereos,
          jewelry. On three floors.

          HORUS
          It's a night job. I sit around.

          HANCOCK
          You're a security guard. You keep the
          state of things. It's a job. You do it.

          (PAUSE)
          We're in the same business.
          Aaron returns with the ketchup bottle.
          A frozen moment while Horus ponders the implications. He stares
          at the BOTTLE.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          Aaron, could you show me the restroom?
          Aaron points first door in the hall.

          AARON
          On the right.
          He leaves to find bladder relief - leaving Horus to his family.

          AARON (CONT' D)
          What do you think, mom?

          MARY
          (in a whisper)
          Horus, what do I do?

          HORUS
          (at his watch)
          I need to get ready.

          AARON
          mom?

          MARY
          (to Horus)
          What do I do with him... when you're
          gone? I have to entertain this super...
          She doesn't finish her... A NOISE interrupts her - seizes the
          participants.

          

          

          

          

          50.
          It comes from the bathroom - the sound of PISS, urine versus the
          surface tension.of water.
          LOUD. WET. A turgid firehose at full blast. The force of
          urination grips the room - as powerful as the penile mechanism
          from which it is generated.
          The toilet FLUSHES. Hancock returns to a'room of astonished
          faces - mouths agape.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Later,. by a few minutes.

          HANCOCK
          (lost; sombre)
          and you could see the flames, through
          the storm... I get there, the vessel's
          all over, spread across three miles of
          South Pacific. Bodies floating in the
          water, shoes, kids who'd thought it some
          routine reconnaissance joyride. Turns
          out, the only one alive was the captain,
          up against a buoy... crying 'cause he
          didn't go down with his men... and he's
          got to live with it.

          (BEAT)
          Sprayed his brain all over the dashboard
          in a parking lot a couple months after. A
          good man...
          (at Aaron)
          . did what he had to do.
          A brief moment while the graphics sink in. No one talks. Aaron's
          smitten. Mary, a mixture of repulsion and fascination.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          In the kitchen, in the sink, stacks of plates indicate that
          dinner is through.
          Company has moved into the living room, with the exception of
          Horus. Aaron kneels besides Hancock. Mary, across from him.

          AARON
          (making a fist)
          I wanted to kill him.

          MARY
          Aaron.

          

          

          

          

          51.

          AARON
          I want to deck him, just once. So bad I
          tense up... like I can't even move.

          MARY
          (to Hancock)
          He comes home crying.

          AARON
          Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off.

          HANCOCK

          (REACTS)
          No... there's no shame in it. The crying.
          It's relief...
          (to Mary)
          we're older and we don't remember
          when... we go, "God, when was the last
          time?" Maybe it's me. It's more an
          effort, now. Takes more pain... more
          blood. Like it's, do you have the time
          anymore? Even to look back and recall a
          moving experience. To be moved.

          (AARON)
          By rage. Hurt.

          (MARY)
          By love.

          (BEAT)
          But if you have to remember the last time
          something touched you... you've missed it
          - you've forgotten how to cry.
          Horus enters the room, Mr. Security Guard. He observes this
          magic Hancock works over his wife and kid - a talent whose
          nature he has yet to comprehend.
          Horus opts to not disturb their trance. He makes for the door.
          Hancock - holds him accountable.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (AWARE)
          Mr. Longfellow. I'll be leaving, too.

          HORUS
          Oh, I... you don't have to leave. I don't
          want to interfere. I have work.

          MARY
          (the original sin)
          Oh, I forgot to make coffee.
          She rushes into the kitchen. Horus stops her.

          

          

          

          

          52.

          HORUS
          It's all right, Mary. I'm late.

          MARY
          No, I'll make it right now.

          HORUS
          I don't have time. I'll grab some on the
          way. Thanks.
          Mary accepts it - not entirely guilt-free.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          I don't want to interrupt. Please don't
          let me stop you.

          HANCOCK
          No, I need to go.
          (at' Mary and only Mary)
          The last time I had a meal... an evening
          like this, I was... it was too long ago.
          I appreciate your kindness.

          MARY

          (AWKWARD)
          Please... you're welcome, here. Anytime.
          Horus watches everything - watching her chest heave under
          Hancock's every word, watching his wife slip away.

          HANCOCK
          Aaron. Tomorrow. After the bell. I'll
          drop by after school. See how you're
          doing.

          AARON

          (SMILES)
          Yeah.
          Horus watches this - his son slipping away.
          The two men leave, Hancock ushering Horus out first.
          Mary closes the door behind them. Leans against the door and
          EXHALES - a sign of relief, of despair, or, of a heart raging
          wild.
          We just .don't know.

          

          

          

          

          53.

          EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The two men appear from the entrance, shoulder to shoulder -
          sort of. They enter the street.

          HORUS

          (POINTING)
          I'm this way.
          Hancock points the opposite way.

          HANCOCK
          Need a lift?

          HORUS
          It's a short walk.
          Acknowledged.
          An awkward beat while they stare at each other...
          . until finally, they go their separate ways - Horus via walk
          and Hancock, with effortless grace,, via flight.
          From the sidewalk and awe-stricken - Horus watches Hancock merge
          into the blackness. A look of dread squats on his face.

          The entrance. Horus wanders in, lost in this environment. He
          finds the front counter. The cops watch him.

          HORUS

          Of course he does.

          Of course.
          Holly returns with the coffee. Hands it to Horus - free of

          INT. AARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Mary's folding clothes by the dresser, busy with thought. Aaron
          squats on the bed, his brain going a mile a minute. He plops
          back against the bed. Brings his hand up to his face. Makes a
          fist. Thinking. Wondering.

          MARY
          What're you doing?
          She's taken by this scene.

          AARON
          (releases fist)
          Thinking.
          Mary goes over to the bed. Sits.

          MARY
          About him?

          AARON
          No. Not really. Are you?

          Me neither. I was thinking.., about
          tomorrow.

          MARY
          Go to sleep. You know what dad says.
          Tomorrow always feels better...

          AARON
          I know, mom... after a good night sleep.
          He says that but he's the one working
          every night. Does that mean he never
          feels better? He's always feeling
          terrible?

          MARY

          Looking down aisles of merchandise - not a trace of life and not
          unlike a cemetery.
          All is dead, with the exception of FOOTSTEPS - shoes pacing
          linoleum. It's Horus, on duty. His flashlight leads the way...

          

          

          

          

          57.
          Outside, the SIRENS of police vehicles charge by - real men en
          route to real work.
          Horus watches them from the window - like a kid who can't come
          out to play.
          He turns to look across the floor - Roheim, against a chair,
          watching the NEWS on a big-screen TV

          NEWS

          Man. I bet he gets laid.
          Horus - he looks terrible.

          EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

          It's dark out here in the night. On the roof. Overlooking the
          community, the Longfellow's apartment building... and Mary's
          bedroom.
          From here, we can SEE her - entering from the hallway. She
          disrobes down to bare back...
          And from this darkness, the RED tip of a burning cigarette GLOWS
          into view. Hancock watches from here, the cigarette BLAZES back
          towards his face intense.

          EXT. SOMEWHERE - NIGHT - DREAM SEQUENCE

          A foreign TERRAIN of trees, of lakes so clear and blue.
          They pass below us as we soar through air and mist...
          the mist clears, thrusting us into the dense foliage of a
          JUNGLE. We penetrate the silence
          the silence, it fades into SONG - the silk, mellifluous
          voice of a woman (not unlike Mary's). Her siren call beckons
          us... takes us deeper into unknown greenery...
          but the sound of crackling GUNSHOTS punctuate the end to
          song. SCREAMS and CRIES rise from the smoke, women and children
          in hysterics...

          

          

          

          

          58.
          we quicken to a frantic pace, slicing through the growth.
          Rocket and mortar shells EXPLODE in our path, splitting trees
          and earth...
          . we remain undaunted... but the WAILS of suffering
          continues...
          until we get there, there in a clearing as smoke and debris
          settle... and we see the remains of a lake, a,lake full of
          BLOOD... of mangled BODIES floating like flotsam... WOMEN and

          CHILDREN... DEAD...
          . we SCREAM!

          INT. RED EYE MOTEL - NIGHT

          Hancock bolts from his bed - horrified, eyes cracked with red
          veins. He is soaked.
          The orgasmic SCREAMS of a prostitute seeps through from the
          adjacent motel room -.the wall behind Hancock's bed trembles to
          the rhythm of each pelvic thrust...
          He clasps.-his ears - tormented.

          Roheim in his usual state of sleep. His lips mutter dialogue
          from an unseen dream.

          ROHEIM

          He snaps out of it...

          ROHEIM (CONT'D)

          Consciousness slowly sinks in. He checks his watch, then the
          area around him. He spots Horus - slumped in a chair, in a
          thinking posture.
          Horns seems lost in his own blank stare.

          HORUS

          EXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - DAY

          A deserted street at this early hour. On the curb and by
          themselves - Horus and Roheim, ruminating.

          ROHEIM
          . that look on her face, you know the
          look, when she's almost there... makes
          you feel like a man.

          (BEAT)
          Then everything gets blurry and all of a
          sudden, it's not my arm that's around her
          and it's not my hand that's touching her
          and it's not even me, my body. Some guy,
          this good-looking guy... he looks like
          the Marlboro Man, only shirtless. And
          so... the Marlboro Man's running his
          fingers through her hair. And he's...
          banging her... and her knees... by her
          ears, you know?
          (beat; cringing)
          And that look on her face. That look.

          HORUS

          Mary and Aaron - they exit, surprising Clyde.
          Mary gestures at Clyde, pointing an accusing finger. She seizes
          the paper from him, sending him cowering inside.

          The sky's POV - the schoolyard. Aaron - sauntering to class.
          Mary - turning, walking away.

          an alley. Descend from the clouds - into the depths of buildings
          and fire escapes.

          Mary, among other pedestrians, head homeward. Her pace say 
          she's in no hurry to get there.
          Out of an alley and into the street - Hancock, trenchcoated,
          inconspicuous, and in pursuit. J

          EXT. LIQUOR STORE - DAY

          Horus waits outside - hands in his pockets. He paces
          uncomfortably.
          Roheim exits the liquor store, already imbibing from a brown
          paper BAG.
          Not a word from Horus.

          ROHEIM

          (POST-GULP)
          This stuff's going to kill me.
          He gives Horus a glance. Takes another swig.

          ROHEIM (CONT' D)

          Your friend. Without a word of caution.
          Not a word. Just take it... you take
          everything.

          HORUS
          No.

          ROHEIM
          You're afraid to offend. You don't want
          to be abrasive. Provocative.
          (beat; as'Horus squirms)
          So you suppress. Do nothing. Take it.
          Roheim takes another gulp.

          HORUS
          (pulling teeth)
          You shouldn't drink.

          ROHEIM
          My wife. She left a bad taste in my
          mouth. I drink to kill-the taste.
          Horus has no response to this.

          nearby garbage can.

          Mary. Walking.
          Hancock. Following. From across the street. Mesmerized and in a
          world to himself.
          He crosses. the street, failing to look both ways... BAH! A UPS
          truck STRIKES the clueless superhero, sending him across air -
          towards Mary.

          

          

          

          

          63.
          200 lbs. of superflesh EXPLODES into a JEWELRY display window -
          just ahead of Mary's path. Glass showers the scene. People

          SCREAM.
          Hancock warbles out from the debris - his trenchcoat reduced to
          mere tatters. He pulls a severed SLEEVE from the rubble. Looks
          at Mary, reposed before him.

          HANCOCK
          (nothing happened)
          How are you?
          In unison, they turn to the UPS vehicle - a .mangled heap of
          steel, STEAM billowing from its ruptured radiator.
          Hancock shrugs a smiles.

          Mr. Longfellow rounds the corner and ambles home. He is tired
          and his face shows it.
          There to make it worse - Clyde. He's back, getting at the sports
          page on the front steps.
          A sudden burst of outrage consumes Horus. He approaches the

          Clyde. Can I talk to you for just a brief

          Along a street somewhere who cares - Hancock and Mary - in a
          cool stroll. Mary holds his trenchcoat, surveying the damage.

          MARY
          What were you doing in the street?
          (the trenchcoat)
          You ripped it pretty good.

          What're you:.. how old's this thing?

          HANCOCK
          didn't see it coming... left myself

          MARY
          It'll be all right.

          HANCOCK
          All right?

          MARY
          It's just the seams. I can sew it back.

          HANCOCK
          What?

          MARY
          (the trenchcoat)
          This. It's just the seams.'I'll take good
          care of it.

          HANCOCK
          You'll sew -it?

          MARY
          Yes. Me. I can. And I'll re-button it for
          you, all right?
          Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one.

          MARY (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING}

          No reply. He stares at her - simply.

          Mary stands alone on the sidewalk, looking up at heaven. Her
          eyes search the gray sky for signs of life.-
          There, overhead - a DOT. It grows in size, getting closer and
          arriving fast... and gradually, it shapes into Hancock.

          

          

          

          

          65.
          He swoops into view, straight downward. Pulls on the air brakes
          and eases into a soft landing - by Mary's side.
          He is wet from his flight and his hands, 'we notice, are cupped
          together tightly.

          MARY
          (like a little girl)
          Let's see.

          HANCOCK
          You have to be quick.

          MARY
          Come on, I want to see.

          HANCOCK
          If you blink, you'll miss it.
          Hancock uncups his hands, releasing a billowy MASS of white
          something - it hangs in the air, and then dissipates into
          moisture. It showers into his open hands.
          Mary reaches for it. Too late.

          MARY
          I saw it, right? A little cloud.
          She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains.
          And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain.
          Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand
          touches his.
          He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls
          her hand away.

          MARY (CONY' D)
          The water is dirty.

          HANCOCK

          MARY

          HANCOCK
          I'm sorry.

          MARY
          (into his eyes)
          It's not your fault.

          

          

          

          

          66.
          Hancock looks away.

          MARY (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You're tense.

          HANCOCK
          I've been tired, lately.

          MARY
          You should slow down. Rest.

          HANCOCK
          -So people tell me.

          MARY
          (heat; upon some thought)
          It must be hard.

          HANCOCK
          Hard?

          MARY
          To always do right... do good when all
          you want to do is rest.

          HANCOCK
          It's harder to not do anything. What am
          I? It's not for me. It's for... it is
          about people. Rest? When there is
          despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am
          relief. You know that instant, that split
          instant of time when you realize that the
          nightmare... the totality of fear
          itself... that it's all been a bad dream?
          That it's safe? That is relief. The
          infant in my arms... to the hysterical
          mother. When you can see her face, what's
          rest? It is self-indulgence.
          Mary - in some advance stage of "wow."

          MARY
          Where... who are you?

          HANCOCK
          It's not important who I am, Mary. Or
          what... where I'm from. It doesn't
          matter. I'm a man. I am every man.

          

          

          

          

          67.

          MARY
          (sizing up his words)
          You probably get a lot of practice
          explaining yourself, on account of who
          you are and what you do.

          HANCOCK
          Why... do you say that?

          MARY
          It's like, everything you say sounds...
          so perfect. Like you rehearse them so
          they'll be that way. I mean, not to say
          that it's insincere...

          (BEAT)
          I mean, maybe it's something about you
          but... it must be hard on you sometimes.
          Hancock stares at his feet, perhaps reluctant to answer.

          MARY (CONT' D)

          (APOLOGETIC)
          But probably not... probably..

          HANCOCK
          Yes...
          (pulling teeth)
          sometimes.
          Mary allows the moment to sink in.

          MARY
          So, you never answered. Back there...
          what were you doing in the middle of the
          street?

          HANCOCK

          (THINKS)
          I was lost...

          (EXHALES)
          . but I think I'm ok, now.

          pell-mell pursuit.
          He cuts into an alley. Looses them momentarily. Finds a DUMPSTER

          Perceval strolls after them, too cool to sweat.
          From the dumpster, little Aaron watches them... looks
          relieved... until conscience kicks in. A moment to reflect, he
          takes.

          Erlick and Spengler - at a dead end. Their trail leads them to a
          metal FENCE, the alley continuing beyond it. No time wasted
          they scale it.
          Perceval arrives - in time to see Erlick, landing on the other
          side. Spengler pulls himself over. Joins Erlick on the ground.

          PERCEVAL
          Shit, I'm not climbing this. Just combed
          my hair.
          Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars. Their
          eyes are of disbelief.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          What's up?
          (checks his hair)
          What?
          Perceval follows their gaze behind him to Aaron, shivering
          with clenched fists.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          (rolls up sleeves)
          I just combed my hair.
          Erlick and Spengler make for the fence, to join the fray.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          Don't bother. He's mine.
          (to Aaron)
          No biting. I hate biting.

          Kick his ass, Percy.

          ERLICK

          (OVERLAPPING)
          Do him, Percy. He's your woman.

          

          

          

          

          69.

          PERCEVAL
          Let's go. Let's have it. While we're
          still kids.
          Nothing from Aaron - just a lot of balls.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          Dick wad, let's go. Come on, you impotent
          little gonad.

          (BEAT)
          Your mother chokes on big, hard, veiny,
          purple-headed shlongs the size of...
          All Aaron needs to hear. He charges - comatose.
          And the pummeling begins. Perceval dictates the assault, landing
          BLOWS to the face and body.
          Aaron - doing an impression of a punching bag. He wafts at air,
          left and right...

          ERLICK
          He's yours.

          SPENGLER
          Save some for us.
          Someone blinks - and Aaron finds himself on the dirt, supine.
          Perceval looms over him, silhouetted against the sky.
          He reaches for his zipper, doing that Perceval-thing. A look of
          recognition in Aaron's eyes - it's going to rain soon.
          He reacts with knee-jerk reflects, administering a swift kick
          into Perceval's peeing apparatus. A faint SQUEAL eructs from the
          fellow's mouth. He drops like a wet tea bag.
          Erlick. Spengler. Shock. Disbelief. Aaron gets to his feet,
          ready to book... but he doesn't. He stays.

          ERLICK
          What's he doing?

          SPENGLER
          Kick his ass, Percy.
          Aaron stares at them, behind the fence. Then down at Perceval
          fetal position, mouth agape. Aaron reaches for his zipper ZIP,
          revenge presents itself.

          ERLICK
          That's cold.

          

          

          

          

          ?0.

          SPENGLER
          Kill him, Percy.
          Aaron cranes himself over Perceval's face, over his open oral
          orifice. Contemplates his target.
          Aaron - to pee or not to pee...
          ZIP. He closes his fly. Steps away.

          AARON
          (to the boys)
          Don't mess with me.
          He struts out of the alley. Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline
          taking him away.

          CUT TO:

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Horus sleeps. Mary enters from the hallway, hush-hush. She moves
          to the closet. Changes out of her clothes.
          Not a stir from Horus - exercising stealth in his efforts to
          watch her, watching her sweater fall to the carpet.
          Mary stands before the closet mirror. Does a profile check. She
          reaches for her bra... and from the mirror, catches Horus
          staring,.

          MARY
          You're still up?
          She moves behind the bathroom door. Self-conscious.

          HORUS
          Just get in?
          Mary steps out of the bathroom, buttoning up her domestic
          attire. She nods affirmatively.

          MARY
          Nick's market. Are you sick?

          HORUS
          I can't sleep.
          She goes to the bed. Palms his forehead with her right. Palms
          her own with the left, as reference.
          Horus tilts his head away from her hand.

          

          

          

          

          71.

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          Please, Mary.

          MARY
          You want some milk? I'll heat it up for
          you, how about that?

          HORUS
          No thank you.

          (BEAT)
          Aaron, today? This Hancock 's picking up

          MARY
          Yes, he is.
          He sits there in bed, struggling with the words. Mary continues
          dressing - oblivious.

          HORUS
          He'll take him home?

          MARY
          Yes.

          HORUS
          What do we know about this man? The
          papers... they don't have all the facts
          about him.

          MARY
          What facts? He's not a hero.

          HORUS
          Yes. A hero. I know that...

          MARY
          Aaron likes him.

          HORUS

          (TIMID)
          I know that maybe, I've been
          neglectful... that I haven't been
          there...
          Mary does not hear him. She's at the mirror, fixing her hair.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (SERIOUSLY)
          I'm trying... you have to know... I'd
          like to be more... involved. Like it used
          to be. Before we moved here.

          HORUS (CONT' D)
          (notices Mary, applying

          LIPSTICK)
          Are you going somewhere?

          MARY
          No. I have to start on dinner. So how
          about that glass of milk?
          Horus - shakes his head, annoyed.

          MARY (CONT' D)
          All right. Try to get some sleep.
          With that, she's out the door.
          Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror at his
          wretched face.
          He spots a brown paper BAG on the chair. Goes to inspect. Inside
          - Hancock's tattered trenchcoat. Oy, what does it mean?
          Horus returns to bed, distraught. He buries himself under the
          cover.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Aaron races down the. last leg of his street. On the steps of his
          apartment building - Hancock, making himself at home. Yes, a
          cigarette smolders from his lips..
          Hancock looks at the boy. They share a second of silence.
          And finally, Hancock-puts out his hand - he approves. Aaron,
          triumphant, SMACKS it for five.

          CUT TO:

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The dinner table. Post meal. Mid-digestion. Aaron is running off
          at the mouth.

          AARON
          .o his mouth was. open and he just stared
          up at me, it hurt that bad.
          And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair -
          a mother grooming her child. Meanwhile, Horus listens concerned.

          AARON (CONTD.)

          (CONTINUING)
          I said, "don't mess with me." Just like
          that.

          AARON (CONT'D)
          "Don't mess with me." Mom, remember that
          guy in the cop movie... he said that?

          MARY
          All right, already. How's your mouth?

          AARON
          It doesn't hurt, I told you.

          (CONTINUING)
          He saw everything from the roof. Said I
          did what I had to do.

          HORUS

          (FINALLY)
          Aaron, tomorrow...

          AARON
          (to Mary; oblivious)
          He said tomorrow, he'd pi ck me up
          again...

          HORUS
          I thought maybe you'd like it -- if I
          pick you.

          AARON
          God, my friends will freak.
          Horus freezes - fades back to his meal, unheard.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Through the dim of light - Horus, alone, prepares for work.
          A framed PHOTOGRAPH of a distinguished MAN (50's) sits on the
          shelf inside the closet - he poses in full police regalia, stern
          and proud.
          Horus pauses to acknowledge the photograph. He closes the closet
          door.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          On the kitchen floor and under the light - Mary and Aaron,
          mother giving son a HAIRCUT.

          MARY
          Hold still.

          AARON
          I like it long.

          MARY
          Shut up.

          

          

          

          

          74.
          Horus walks into the living room,. in the dark. He looks at his
          wife, then at his son - doing their own thing. They don't
          realize he's there.
          Horus leaves, the door'CLICKS shut behind him.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Horus?

          AARON
          it's almost eight. Dad's late.

          MARY
          Horus?
          She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the
          bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front door. Opens it into
          the stairway outside.
          There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way
          up. Mary sees him... and they look at each other.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          In the kitchen and under the light, Mary. Hancock. Aaron. Mary
          is finishing up on Aaron, applying the last SNIP.

          AARON
          like this?
          (holds up hand)
          How do you make a fist?

          MARY
          (grabs his head)
          Aaron, hold it.
          Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes.
          So there it is, the fist - this petrified mass of knuckles and
          bones. It SNARLS at Aaron.
          Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't
          let go of them.
          Aaron swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in
          him.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Hancock?
          The sound of her voice takes him. He snaps out of it.

          

          

          

          

          15.

          MARY (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING
          ) turn. Hancock, it's yo ur

          HANCOCK
          What?

          MARY
          Your hair. Come on, have a seat.

          AARON
          Mom's going butcher your hair.

          MARY
          Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n
          homework.

          AARON
          Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her,
          Hancock.
          Hancock shrugs a "what can I do."

          AARON (CONT' D)
          Yeah, right. I know. I got to do what I
          got to do.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The Big Haircut. Mary and Hancock - up close. Mary runs her
          fingers through his hair, testing his length. She leans into
          him. SNIP, goes her scissor.
          Hancock - in his seat, as hard as marble. He seems a bit lost in
          her presence. Baffled.
          From his position, the view consists of Mary - blossoming in her
          sweater.
          And that's it. Not a word during this process - just the SOUND
          of their breaths.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Hancock.
          Erected before us, the immediate product of a mediocre haircut -
          he looks plain and un-super. He looks... goofy.

          MARY
          There... my hero.
          He inspects himself via a hand MIRROR. Smiles. Politely.

          

          

          

          

          76.

          MARY (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          How do you like it?

          HANCOCK
          Nice. Thank you.
          Mary - peripatetic, putting away things...

          MARY
          I started out just trimming for Horus.
          Here and there. He had to look just right
          for the academy, says his father, a
          police captain there... in Philly. When
          we moved here, I pretty much took over as
          the resident barber. You know, to save
          some money.

          HANCOCK
          He was in the-police academy?
          A pause.

          MARY
          His father's idea. Not his. He went
          through it anyway, like he had something
          to prove... the validation of his
          manhood.

          (BEAT)
          It tpok everything out of him. He didn't
          talk for days after he was cut. He took
          it real hard. I mean, still, he's not...
          I mean,, he's still...
          (edits herself)
          .it was a difficult time for hi.. Me. I
          understand that I'm not intolerant of it,
          the working-through process. It's just
          that, sometimes...
          (at Hancock)
          sometimes, I need his strength. I
          miss. the strength.

          HANCOCK
          Is that what you want?

          MARY
          Want?

          HANCOCK
          What you need?

          MARY
          The hair... I need to...

          

          

          

          

          77.
          She kneels to sweep up hair. Hancock follows her down.

          HANCOCK
          Mary?

          MARY
          Yes?

          HANCOCK

          (BEAT)
          You ever been down the boardwalk, at
          night?

          MARY
          Why... what for?
          They're eye to eye. Close.

          AARON (O.S.)
          Mom?
          Mary bursts from her perch - regroups, awkwardly. Aaron stands
          in the hallway, his hair still wet from the shower.

          MARY
          Yes.
          Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah!

          AARON
          my mouth. It's starting to swell. I
          think he loosened a tooth.
          Mary - maternal duty calls.

          MARY
          All right. Go to your room. I'll get the
          ice pack.
          Aaron exits. Mary exits.
          Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for
          the front door.
          Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him...

          MARY (CONT' D)
          You're leaving?

          HANCOCK
          It's getting late.

          

          

          

          

          78.

          MARY
          I'm sorry.

          HANCOCK
          I'm going to take a walk.

          MARY
          Really? On the boardwalk?

          HANCOCK
          Maybe.
          Pause.

           AARON (O.S.)
          Mom.'

           MARY
          I'm sorry.
          She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he
          stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought.

          HANCOCK

          (FINALLY)
          Good night, Mary.

          MARY
          Good night.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          The clock - 9:45 pm.
          The store rests in afterhour stillness. Horus paces by the side
          door, his ears pressed to the phone receiver - no answer.
          He hangs up. Checks his watch. Goes to the front entrance and
          peers out at the street - no Roheim.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          The bar. The smoke. The scums of humanity. Gina - over there,
          marketing her cleavage to anything with a pulse and a penis.
          She mingles with a BAR FLY.
          Her eyes locate Hancock - entering, finding a seat.
          From an adjacent stool, A MAN places his hand on Hancock's lap.
          Whispers to him.

          

          

          

          

          79.

          MAN
          I wear dresses. How about you?

          HANCOCK
          (considers; nah)
          Get lost.
          The warning comes across quite well - the man exits.
          Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the
          bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door.

          GINA
          (to bar fly)
          Meet you outside. The El Camino, right?
          The bar fly nods. Exits. Gina turns to Hancock. Takes his face
          in her hands, studies him.

          GINA (CONT'D)
          Your eyes are calm. It's good.
          She withdraws her hands.

          HANCOCK
          What?

          GINA
          But you're still here.
          She rises. And as she makes for the exit...

          GINA (CONT'D)
          Nice haircut.
          Hancock watches as the night swallows her whole. He inhales the
          rest of his cigarette - pensive.

          CUT TO:

          The clock, it reads 1:05 am.
          Horns, his flashlight, they're making their rounds. His routine
          takes him outside - via an EXIT door.

          EXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          A dark alley. Dumpsters. Boxes.
          Horus peruses the premises. Heads around the building and to the
          street.:.

          . as a ragged FIGURE collapses onto.him. It's Roheim and he's
          been drinking, right?

          HORUS
          Dear God.
          Horus catches him.

          INT. WATANABE'S - NIGHT

          They find a chair in the back, Horus Positioning Roheim in the
          light. The old man isn't drunk - his mouth agape, his face
          bruised with wounds from a serious pummeling.
          A chunk of lip dangles, bleeds.

          HORUS
          Jesus.
          Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to
          nurse' the wounds.

          ROHEIM
          Figured I can get you by the front... but
          you weren't there.

          HORUS
          (dabbing the torn lip)
          Who... what happened?

          ROHEIM
          They-jumped me. That bastard Scarpo and
          his boys. They were waiting on me.
          Returns to get more clean towels. And comes back.

          HORUS
          Why didn't you come through the back...
          standing out there in the dark?

          ROHEIM
          -Couldn't find my keys. Must've dropped
          them'in the fight.
          (feels his lip)
          Shit...
          He works himself off the chair. Heads inside the bathroom.

          HORUS
          What're you doing?

          

          

          

          

          81.

          ROHEIM
          (into the mirror)
          the old man
          Look at what they did.. gave
          a fat lip to match his big mouth. I'm for
          shit.

          HORUS

          (FRUSTRATION)
          Sit down
          Could you knock it off, please.
          so I can clean the cuts.
          He leads the old wretch back to the chair.

          ROHEIM
          I'm a waste of time...

          HORUS
          Stop.

          ROHEIM
          I'm too old for this.

          HORUS
          You're not old.

          ROHEIM
          What am I... I'm biologically challenged.
          Any way you look, I'm a waste of effort.

          (BEAT)

          I
           Use to be, I blame the job. The job.
           think, bullshit job. Not right for a man.
           "To observe and record..." I say, what a t's for
           the hell is DIo nly
           dogs. They got a d o o gs in t g g hisn
           reason we're he d re, we don't shit on the
          carpet.
          Horus looks away. Doesn't want to hear it.

          ROHEIM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          But you know what, Horus. That's all
          wrong. It ain't the job. The job don't
          make the man. It's me. Not the uniform.
          It starts right here... 'cause I can't do
          anything right. Fuck up my ABC's.
          (a beat; at Horus)
          But you. Why do you put up with this
          crap? A wife. A kid. There... waiting for
          you at home.
          Horus - he just doesn't know anymore.

          

          

          

          

          82.

          EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT

          On the rooftop of this building - Hancock, on another end of a
          Marlboro. Eyes red. Hair in wet dishevelment. He's a mess.

          HANCOCK
          got to do what you got to do.
          He paces with nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other
          hand. We sense a decision brewing...

          INT. THE LONGFELLOW BEDROOM - NIGHT

          A desk clock points to 2:30 am.
          Mary - awake undercover. She twists, turns...
          A shadow engulfs the side of her wall, smothering the light in
          the room. Mary catches it. Rises above her blanket.
          What she sees - outside the window, Hancock hanging there in non-
          gravity. He stares directly at her.

          HANCOCK
          I know you're up, Mary. I know you can
          hear me. Please meet me on the boardwalk
          tomorrow morning. Nine o'clock. It's
          important that I talk to y ou, then.

          (GRAVELY)
          Please, Mary.
          And with that, he's off and away. Mary.- stunned.

          CUT TO:

          INT. ROHEIM'S APARTMENT - DAY

          We're in the staircase - where Horus is, supporting Roheim up
          the stairs.

          ROHEIM
          They're going to can me.

          HORUS
          No one's canning anyone. No one saw us...
          watch your step... leave.

          ROHEIM
          Should be an extra key over the door.

          

          

          

          

          83.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          In the kitchen, Mary and Aaron - the morning routine. Something
          is off this morning, like someone threw a wrench into the
          machinery.
          Mary appears a bit frazzled, handing her son toasts. She rushes
          back to the stove - her eggs beckoning.

          AARON
          The toast's burnt.

          MARY
          What?
          Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox.

          AARON
          We're late... you forgot the corn chips.
          Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down... and all
          over the place.

          MARY
          Eat... and we'll go.
          (checks her watch)
          Where's your father?
          She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair.

          AARON
          You forgot the corn...
          (the comb snags)
          . ouch!

          MARY
          I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll
          be home before we leave. I'm sorry.

          AARON
          You having your period, mom?
          She responds with a brisk slap to the head... SMACK.

          INT. ROHEIM'S APARTMENT - DAY

          We enter an anal-retentively neat and manicured living room.
          Horus ushers Roheim in...

          ROHEIM
          Shoes.
          The two pause. Remove their shoes. Proceed into bedroom.

          

          

          

          

          84.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Horus sets Roheim down on the bed. Tucks him under.

          HORUS
          You're going to be okay?

          ROHEIM
          I don't know. You might have solo act
          tomorrow night.

          HORUS
          Get some sleep.

          ROHEIM
          You're a good man, Horus.

          HORUS
          (washing over it)
          I have to get home, now. I'll call.
          Roheim grabs on to his sleeve.

          ROHEIM
          You know what Olga said before she walked
          out on me? Her last words to me. She
          turned at the front door. Looked around
          the room and she says, "keep it clean."
          That's it, can you believe it? Then out
          the door.

          (BEAT)
          But like a.shmuck,.I keep the place
          spotless... in case she walks through
          that door one day.
          (at Horus; with pain)
          I don't think she's coming back.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Horus struggles homeward - his mind in a headlock with anger,
          despair, a combination thereof.
          He moves down his street. Looks ahead - where Clyde stands,
          pillaging his morning paper. Clyde Spots Horus on the approach.
          Smiles at him, with impunity. Goes back in.
          On Horus - you can boil an egg in his seething mouth.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          Fist clenched, the morning paper under his arm - Horus. steadies
          down the hallway. His eyes target the door at the end of the hall, seeing red.

          

          

          

          

          85.
          He gets there, the door. He swallows. Wipes sweat off his hand.
          KNOCK. And again, KNOCK.
          ï¿½ow
          He fidgets in his spot - courage evaporating with every elapsed
          second. Until finally, Horus is a pile of dung.
          The door opens.
          And Clyde emerges, tall and ugly. He's holding up his pants with
          one and the SPORTS PAGE with the other.
          Caughtin mid-defecation, he is none too happy.

          CLYDE
          The box scores are waiting and I got an
          inch of meat sticking out of my ass. Make
          it snappy.

          HORUS
          (loosing his voice)
          I'd like my sports page, please.

          CLYDE
          You what?

          HORUS
          I want you to stop taking my sports page.

          CLYDE
          All right.
          Clyde closes the door. Horus - thunderstruck.
          He stutter-steps... KNOCKS...

           CLYDE (CONT' D)

           (AGITATED)
           What's the matter, you deaf? I'll stop
           taking your sports page. Now get out of
          here and let me...

          HORUS

          (INTERRUPTS)
          I want today's sports page.

          CLYDE
          You what?

          HORUS
          That there... my sports page.

          

          

          

          

          86.

          CLYDE
          What's gotten in to you? All of a sudden?
          You don't even like football.
          Horus does.not budge.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You'll get it back... after I take my
          dump.
          Clyde proceeds to close the door... but Horus interjects, his
          foot in the door.

          HORUS
          No.

          CLYDE
          What?

          HORUS
          No. I would like my sports page now.
          Please.

          CLYDE
          After I finish.

          HORUS
          I'd prefer it now.

          CLYDE
          What's eating you, Longfella? You crazy?
          Without warning, Horus wrests the sports page from Clyde's arm
          a kamikaze move, indeed.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)

          (SHOCKED)
          Give that back.
          Horns lunges at his hulking opponent, lands a punch into Clyde's
          midsection. Harmless - it tickles him, maybe.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)
          Why'd you go and do that for?
          Clyde belts up has pants. Roles up his sleeves.., and the
          massacre commences.
          He simply tears into Horus... SLOWS to the stomach... RIGHTS
          across the face. It ends quickly and without resistance - as if
          Horns accepted it as fate.

          

          

          

          

          87.
          Clyde 'kneels over. Picks up the sports page. And as if yawning,
          returns to his room.

          KAW/

          CUT TO:

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          By the fence - Mary and Aaron.
          Mary, with a brown paper BAG, seems.distant, preoccupied in a
          far away place.

          AARON
          Are you all right, mom?

          MARY

          (DISTRACTED)
          Yeah... why?

          AARON
          You're acting weird.

          MARY
          (didn't hear)
          What?

          AARON
          I'm late for class. Go home, mom. I think
          it's time for your nap.
          Aaron leaves.
          Pensive, Mary begins her walk... to the boardwalk.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The door swings open to admit Horus - battered, enraged,
          disoriented. He confronts an empty apartment.

          HORUS
          Mary!
          A deaf ear. No one's there to console him. He storms out of the
          apartment.

          EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY

          The ocean RAGES against the shore, in the distance and at some
          muffled volume.
          Up against the railing leans Hancock, and the remains of a
          cigarette. His hair drips of salt water - he's been here a
          while, one would suspect.

          

          

          

          

          88.

          COP (O.S.)
          Come back here! Stop him!
          In the background, a COP commences pursuit on a THIEF.
          The thief dashes by - pass an indifferent Hancock. The cop
          follows suit, passing by.

          COP (CONT'D)
          Stop him!
           Hancock - his gaze wavers not from the distant waters.

          EXT..STREET - DAY

           Horus stumbles. Keeps his balance. Trudges down the street to a
          corner BAR.

          INT. BAR - DAY

          The bar is empty at this hour. The chairs are up, the floor
          swept. A husky BARTENDER unloads liquor in the back.
          Horus enters. Finds a stool.

          HORUS
          Drink.
          The bartender comes out, considers this man's appearance.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Is this a bar... or what? Drink.
          (uncomfortable with his own

          RUDENESS)
          Please.

          EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY

          Mary stands there on the boardwalk, the bag in her arms.
          It's cold this morning. A little wind has picked up. And the
          clouds - they're alive, restless.
          She finds Hancock, staring at her, waiting for. her.

          HANCOCK
          Hi.

          (EMBARRASSED)
          Thank you for being here.

          MARY
          Is everything all right?

          MARY (CONT' D)

          (CONCERNED)
          What's wrong?

          HANCOCK
          (constipated; following some

          THOUGHT)
          It's cold.
          Mary and Hancock - we notice, they look good together.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          (at the clouds)
          They're moving. The turbulence has
          started.

          MARY
          Tell me what's wrong.
          He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into
          darkness.

          HANCOCK
          Look out there and what do you see, Mary?

          MARY

          (PERPLEXED)
          Nothing. I don't know... I don't see
          anything.

          HANCOCK
          see it,can
           It's out there. But you can't
          Y nu?
          (beat; holding on to a thread)
          And that's good, not seeing. But for me,
          I've seen it. It's where I'm from... out
          there.

          MARY
          Please, Hancock. What are you talking
          about? What's out there?

          HANCOCK
          Duty.
          (beat; at Mary)
          You ask a man, Mary, and he'll tell you.
          He'll say: "you do what you have to do."
          Or what? You let the next guy do it for
          you, if you don't... if you can't.
          (losing it)
          And... but. If I can't, then who?

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          The next guy? No. There is no "I can't."
          Just "I must."
          Mary - watching a grown superman unravel.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          But I don't ask, "why me?" I don't
          question it. This is me. I'm it. I do
          what I have to do. I get in there.., all
          the killing... the blood... and I deal
          with it. I clean up. I make things right.

          (BEAT)
          And. But when.., where does it end?
          (re: his cape)
          Can't stop the hemorrhage... it's
          everywhere. And it stays. All that I can
          do, Mary. The things I am capable of
          doing, I can't blink away the hell I've
          seen. It's in me...
          (points to his head)
          in here and I can't not think about
          it. It's in me. It's me.

          MARY
          Hancock... what...

          HANCOCK
          I just want to let go, Mary. Or I'll
          break. I need to get away. Get away to
          where? I don't know.
          (at Mary)
          I need your help.

          MARY
          Me? What can I do?
          (she's helpless)
          What do you want me to do?

          HANCOCK
          I want you to save me.

          MARY
          How?
          Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her.
          Their lips lock, twisted and entwined... until Mary, composing
          her senses, pulls away.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Don ' t.

          

          

          

          

          91.

          HANCOCK

          (DESPERATE)
          Save me.

          MARY
          I can't.

          HANCOCK
          You can.
          (the hard sell)

          AND
          Mary,-I'll take you away. And Aaron.
          what... I'll quit. Get a real job. An
          apartment. I'll flip burgers. I don't
          know what I'm doing... what I'm saying
          anymore.

          MARY

          (OVERLAPPING)
          I'm married.
          A pause.

          HANCOCK
          To whom?

          MARY
          I love him.
          The death blow.

          HANCOCK
          No.
          (turns from her)
          Unacceptable.

          MARY
          I love him. I'm sorry.
          One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this
          superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel.
          Mary wants to console... but what can she do?

          HANCOCK
          I'm cold.
          Mary hands him the contents of the bag - the trenchcoat.

          MARY
          I'm sorry.

          

          

          

          

          92.
          She leaves.

          CUT TO:

          INT. BRADLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

          Aaron. The school hallway. He holds a wooden hall PASS,
          indicating that class is in session.
          He swings into the BOYS ROOM.

          INT. BOYS ROOM - DAY

          A large restroom - empty. Little Aaron passes up on the urinals.
          Selects a private STALL. ZIP - urination begins.
          Splash segues into drip. DRIP. Aaron shakes off the last drop...

          PLOP.
          And that's the cue for the adjacent stalls - arms like tentacles
          surface from below, shackling Aaron in his spot. He can't see
          but, from behind, the stall door opens...
          Guess who?
          Perceval - possessed. He grabs the back of Aaron's head.
          Introduces it to the yellowed waters below.
          SPLASH - the head goes in, submerged. What Aaron sees for the
          next several seconds: yellow, the thrashing of.bubbles, the
          shine.-of white porcelain at.intimate range.
          What he hears: the GASPING of his own breath, GURGLE, and wicked
          laughter.
          The ambush ends. Perceval. Erlick. Spengler. One of them says...

          THEM

          (MOCKINGLY)
          "Don't mess with me."
          They leave - laughing.

          THEM (CONT'D)
          (in the distant)
          Little shit.
          Left there and in the stall - Aaron, slumped against the bowl.
          On the tile floor. A wet rag of piss.

          

          

          

          

          93.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          Mary hurries into the room - flustered, adrenaline coursing
          wild.
          She runs down the hallway to her bedroom, seeking solace in
          Horns. The cold, empty bed says he hasn't been home.

          MARY
          Horus...

          CUT TO:

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          The school front. KIDS swarm into the streets, freshly released
          from captivity. And there amidst bedlam - Aaron, roughed-up and
          soiled in disgrace.
          He moves to the curb, waiting for someone to take him away. No
          Hancock, anywhere.
          Aaron waits, hopeful.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Hancock walks an aimless walk - in oblivion, a WHISKEY BOTTLE in
          his hand. He's been drinking. L"i
          in his path and up ahead, a little girl SUE (8) beckons at the
          upper branches of a tree.

          SUE
          (so innocent, her voice)
          Hymie. Come down, Hymie.
          She catches Hancock, Mr..Superhero who can fly, stumbling by.

          SUE (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Mister? My Hymie won't come down from the
          tree.
          Hancock's reaction - "what?"

          SUE (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          My pussycat. She won't come down.
          She stares up at him with big, blue, sad, helpless, innocent
          eyes.

          

          

          

          

          94.
          So cool, Hancock reaches down for a PEBBLE - takes it in his
          palm. Finds the little pussy named Hymie. And with a simple
          flick of the wrist... shoots it down.
          A sharp MEOW. punctuates the task. Hymie drops from the branch,
          limp and lifeless. A THUD we hear on impact.

          SUE (CONT'D)
          (so innocent, her voice)
          Holy fuck.
          Hancock resumes his course, taking off and into the wet sky.

          EXT. SKY - DAY

          Hancock's drunken flight - erratic and dangerously close to...
          BAM... buildings. He strikes the corner of a brick tower,
          plummeting downward with the dislocated debris.
          He bounces off the concrete -.in an alley.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Mary is on the sofa - wondering where Horus might be. She checks
          h er watch.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          The place is empty. Deserted.
          Aaron. On the curb. Some trash flutters by his feet. On his face
          - the abandonment of all hope. Nobody's coming, this is clear.

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Hancock - on his back and amidst the rubble.
          He braces the building to get up. Drops. Gets to his feet, only
          to be confronted by the police officer from the boardwalk.
          We'll call this one officer REED - a beat cop with something
          stiff up his ass.

          REED
          What do we have here? A piece of shit.
          A slow look of recognition seizes his face - this is that
          superguy.
          Hancock stares at him.

          

          

          

          

          95.

          HANCOCK

          (HUMORLESS)
          Fuck off.
          He pushes past Reed, who acquieces willingly.

          EXT. STREET - DAY


          A
          Aaron. Walking home. Dejected. His eyes catch a glimpse of
          particular pedestrian down the street - Hancock. He gives
          chase... and confronts him, out of breath.

          AARON
          (a slight smile)
          Hi.

          HANCOCK
          (turning; drunk)
          What're you doing here?

          AARON
          (the smile fades)
          I saw you walking. Where were you today?
          You said you'd... be there.
          Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame.

          HANCOCK
          I don't know what you're talking about.

          AARON
          Where are you going? Can I go?

          HANCOCK
          You don't want to go where I'm going.

          AARON
          Those assholes got me in the bathroom,
          today...
          (trying to hold on)
          and you said you'd pick me up at
          school.
          Hancock turns. He's upset now.

          HANCOCK
          Listen.
          Aaron recoils.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Listen. I'm not here to save you.

          (MORE)

          96.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          No, not my job. Don't put that on me.
          (pounds his chest)
          Not my problem. Not on my shoulders. Deal
          with it, kid. You are what you are and...
          what I say, it won't do you any change.
          You'll grow up to be just like-your old
          man. A coward. Not a damn thing you can
          do about it... 'cept grab both ankles,
          hope by the grace of God the reaming's
          gentle.
          Aaron backs away from his angry wrath.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          That's right. Walk away. Me... I'm not
          here to save you.
          He watches Aaron break 1into a run - another youngster dashed
          against the rocks.
          In Hancock's eyes - a .glint of regret. But only a glint.

          INT. BAR - DAY

          This empty bar.
          With the exception of Horus and the bartender - while he's
          drying some mugs, let's call him JOEY (30).

          HORUS

          (BOOZED)
          One.more.
          Joey studies him. He takes a mug and begins to fill it...

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          No... nevermind.
          (going to blow)
          Where's your bathroom?

          JOEY
          (not in my place)
          Bathroom's closed.
          Horus politely stands'- teeters a bit.

          HORUS
          How much.

           JOEY

          (SARCASM)
          Let's see... that's one beer. Tell you
          what. I'll take care of this one.

          

          

          

          

          97.

          HORUS
          Thank you.

          JOEY
          The register ain't open yet, anyhow.
          Horus doesn't hear him. He's already on the move, making a dash
          for the door. But too late - he VOMITS at the front entrance.

          JOEY (CONT'D)
          Shit.

          EXT. HADES - DAY

          In the armpit of town - Hancock. He lights a cigarette with the
          matchbook Gina had given him earlier.
          At attention before him - Gina, gnawing on gum, heaving in all
          her glory.

          GINA
          I've been waiting.
          They stare for one horny beat.
          Hancock moves into her. Buries his head into her bosoms, looking
          for solace. She takes him in, very maternal this Gina.

          \./

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The front door opens, but slowly. Aaron steps inside.
          From the kitchen, Mary spots him in his violated condition. He
          sees her reaction, that of shock - and like that, he runs
          s obbing into her arms.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. HADES - DAY

          A phone booth - Gina's office.
          There in the back alley and in this glass booth - Hancock and
          Gina, their organs ensnared. They're pumping away. Up. Down.
          A surreal sight, indeed - the red of his cape and the black of
          her leather.

          GINA
          Come on, baby. Relax.

          HANCOCK
          I can't.

          

          

          

          

          98.

          GINA
          You can.
          The phone begins to RING - but they're busy.

          HANCOCK
          I can't.

          GINA
          Let it go, baby. Just let it...

          RING...

          HANCOCK
          (in tears)
          I can't.
          His arm rips through the glass...

          GINA
          . go.

          (ORGASMS)
          Oh god.

          HANCOCK
          I can't!

          RING...
          He DRILLS a hole into the phone - killing it.'

          GINA
          Don't give up, now.
          He lets her down. Tears out of the booth. Finds the sky.

          EXT. SHEEPSHEAD BAY - NIGHT

          There is movement in the sky above - aggressive formations and
          grooves in clouds once coy and demure. The wind HUMS its
          presence, toys with fallen leaves.

          'INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          It's dinner - but all is not well. Mary and Aaron and an empty
          chair. '
          They sit without talking.. They eat without making a sound.
          Between them - a ketchup bottle.
          The door bursts wide, coughing up Horus. He locates his chair
          and plops on it... misses... kisses the carpet.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          HORUS
          (on the ground; prone)
          Son. Go to your room.
          Struggles to his knees.

          MARY
          What happened toyou?

          AARON
          Dad, are you wasted?

          MARY
          Where... Aaron, he's not wasted. Go to
          your room.

          AARON
          He is wasted.
          Horus rises, under great difficulty. Feels his way to the sofa.
          When Mary tries to assist, he waves her away.

          HORUS
          Aaron. Go to your room.

          AARON
          But dad...

          MARY

          (AUTHORITY)
          Go!
          Aaron obliges, at reluctant pace.

          MARY (CONT' D)
          What do you think you're doing, Horus
          Longfellow?
          Horus gauges her.

          HORUS
          Don't "Horus Longfellow" me, Mary. I'm
          not your child. I'm your husband.

          MARY
          Horus, what're you talking about?
          (re: bruises)
          Who did this to your face?
          Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength.

          

          

          

          

          100.

          HORUS

          (OBLIVIOUS)
          But you didn't know-about me...
          Mary knows where this is headed.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You didn't know I was going to do this to
          you.
          (a half-chuckle)
          I guess I should've known. We were
          married and I knew... at the reception. I
          couldn't dance. so I sat in the back and
          watched. You were with Stuart Olmsted and
          I watched you dance. In your white dress.
          And I remember zoning out... for a
          second, just watching you. God, Mary...
          the little girl next door who used to get
          into fist fights with her brothers in
          those patched-up Toughskins. We met only
          'cause the tallest tree in the
          neighborhood was in my backyard and you
          needed to climb it.

          (BEAT)
          But that night. God, you looked so
          beautiful I.had to realize it... how much
          I loved you... one more time.

          (BEAT)
          You and Stuart danced. Laughed. And I
          remember I'm watching you there, with
          him... together like that. You looked
          good with him, I thought all of a sudden.
          Like you belong... better. And as I
          stared across the floor, it was the same
          story with all the guys there, that they
          were more right for you.

          (SWALLOWS)
          More right because that night, you walked
          in with the wrong man.

          MARY
          Why do you say that?

          HORUS
          Because I let you down.

          (BEAT)
          I'm a coward. I can't do anything about
          it. Look at me, I'm breaking up in front
          of you. And God, I fear the day when I'd
          have to defend you and Aaron. What do I
          do, then? What am I if I can't do that...
          my own wife, family? Not a man.

          

          

          

          

          101.

          are. Did
          You're a fool, that's what you
          you think I was completely blind when I
          married you? Something cuts at your
          masculine ego and it's the pressure...
          the standard's unreasonable. The woman,
          she wants me to part oceans. That's the
          kind of bull shit's made of. I went w
          through it...,I was there when the hurt
          came, when the academy said no. I
          there. And when you felt like hiding...
          from me and your ownforward. taking

           the closet,
          Horus stands there - tears, almost. He takes to his security
          retrieving his U-Rent Security Jacket. He grabs
          hat. Straightens his hair. Puts it on.

          MARY (CONT' D)
          Horns, what are you doing?
          Inserts the flashlight into his holster.

          HORUS

           the frontdoor.

          The picture of Ted "the police captain" Brock succumbs to the

          Casualties come in the form of CRIES, women and children on the v erge of incineration.
          Hancock's POV: a burning hallway, flames spewing from every
          crevice - we're walking through Hell.
          We see a BOY, huddled under a table. Hancock wraps his cape
          around him. Bolts through the inferno... as glass SHATTERS...
          and gas pipes ERUPT.
          He takes the boy to safety. Unwraps the cape... only to see the
          CHARRED remains of a human BODY...
          the-CRIES, they continue...

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The room is dark, of course. A BED - as the SQUEAKING of springs
          suddenly stops.
          A woman's VOICE says...

          What's the matter?

          HANCOCK

          I need a cigarette, goddamn it!
          He storms from the bed. Heads for the bathroom.

          VOICE
          I don't smoke. What's wrong with you?
          She rises after him and into view - it's no other than the TV
          reporter, in the flesh. She bounces over to the bathroom, as the
          door SLAMS shut.

          latches on to his magnanimous member.
          Outside and beyond the door, the reporter has her ear pressed
          against wood - listening.
          So there our superhero stands, bent over a bit, yanking up a

          Cue for the reporter to back away.

          The bathroom door flies open. Hancock emerges, buttoning his

          What're you doing?
          Hancock closes in. Corners her.

          I'm pissed!

          Mary SCREAMS. Hancock cringes, says...

          You're getting on my nerves.

          Hancock, please.
          He reaches down and untangles Mary from her son - she concedes
          out of fear for Aaron.

          AARON
          No! Mom!

          MARY
          Stay back, Aaron!
          Hancock takes her away - like booty. Aaron dangles from his

          Scarpo - a dumbfounded look entwined in pain. He drops.

          GROWLS - looking to retaliate. But there's no Horus.
          Hancock explores the rubble - by the building. A sudden
          EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall
          loose, sending it crashing down.., on Hancock.

          excavate his wife - one brick at a time.
          Roheim meets him there, in an effort to console.

          ROHEIM (O.S.)
          (you're wasting your time)
          Come on, Horus.
          Horus - lost in the pain. He won't listen.
          Slowly and with a sense of duty, Roheim joins the excavation. He
          r olls up his sleeve and gets to work.
          Hancock drops the yield,sign. Turns to the battlefield in his
          midst... surveys the carnage...
          A loaded beat.
          Hancock ROARS - a cry of desperation. He grimaces with defeat.
          Staggers off. SCREAMS, because what else can he do. Falls to his
          knees... by a fallen police GUN.

          He picks it up...
          points it at his head...

           FIRES the remaining rounds against his temple. Bullets carom
          off skull.
          Hancock discards the gun. Breaks into TEARS. Long SOBBING wet
          tears. He CRIES. He WEEPS. Into his cupped hands. Indeed, a
          surreal sight.
          Horus. Roheim. Engaged to the task, brick by brick. Horus works
          his way down... to a lifeless ARM, protruding from its tomb.
          He stops.

          

          126.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Aaron - in his pajamas, creeping down a dark hallway. He
          approaches a DOOR.

          NARRATOR (V.0.)
          sometimes when it's dark out, so dark
          it's black, I'll see HIM.
          Aaron peers through the open door. His eyes wander inside ever
          so gently.
          On the bed there - HIM... Horns.

          NARRATOR (V.0.) (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          and it starts allover again.
          And Mary. They are in some latter state of coital bliss.
          Horus THRUSTS.
          Mary GASPS...

          NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Some things... you just never forget.

          FADE OUT:



          THE END
