          As the Universal logo completes itself, we begin to
          slowly push in on the East Coast of the United States.
          The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through
          the clouds, closer and closer, until we begin to see
          large patches of snow covering the upper coastline. It's
          winter. We continue to push in, until we arrive at one
          small suburban neighborhood. Over the push-in, we hear
          the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           It has been said that magic vanished from
           our world a long time ago. And that
           humanity can no longer fulfill its
           desires through the power of wishes.
           To those who have lost the wondrous
           vision of childhood eyes, submitted here
           is the story of a little boy, and a
           magical Christmas wish that changed his
           life forever.
                         
                         
          EXT./ESTAB. A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           It began in 1985, in a town just outside
           Boston.
                         
          We see a GROUP OF KIDS laughing and tossing snowballs at
          each other in the street.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           It was Christmas Eve, and all the
           children were in high spirits. That
           special time of year when Boston children
           gather together and beat up the Jewish
           kids.
                         
          Another little kid walks out of his house with a sled,
          and starts walking up the street. One of the snowball-
          throwing kids points at the sled kid.
                         
                          KID #1
           Hey, Greenbaum!
                         
                          GREENBAUM
           Uh oh.
                         
                          KID #1
           It's Jesus' birthday tomorrow! You know
           what I'm gonna get him?
                         
                          GREENBAUM
           W...what?

                         CONTINUED:
                         
                          KID #1
           My fist in your fuckin' face!
                         
                          GREENBAUM
           Why would Jesus want that?
                         
                          KID #2
           Get him!
                         
          The kids all chase Greenbaum up the street, and tackle
          him. Another boy, JOHN BENNETT (about 8 years old, shy
          and innocent-looking) approaches the melee.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           But there was one child who wasn't in
           such good spirits. Little John Bennett.
           That one boy in every neighborhood who
           just has a tough time making friends.
                         
                          JOHN
           Hey guys, can I play?
                         
          The kids all look at him.
                         
                          KID #1/#2/#3
           Get outta here! / Get outta here,
           Bennett! / Get lost, Bennett!
                         
          The Jewish kid, his face bloodied, looks angrily at John.
                         
                          GREENBAUM
           Yeah, Bennett, get outta here!
                         
          The kids go back to beating up Greenbaum, as John sadly
          walks back toward his house.
                         
          INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - SHORTLY AFTER
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           John longed with all his heart for that
           one true friend that he could call his
           own. And he knew that if he ever found
           that friend, he would never let him go.
                         
          John sadly sits by his window with his chin in his hands,
          looking outside. John'S POV - We see the other kids all
          playing in the snow: building snowmen, throwing
          snowballs, etc. At one point, a BLACK KID IN A
          WHEELCHAIR wheels up. The other kids welcome him with
          open arms, and he immediately joins in the fun.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           Well, as it does every year, Christmas
           morning finally came.

           All the children were opening their gifts
           with holiday glee.
                         
                         
          INT. A SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          A LITTLE GIRL opens a present as her parents look on,
          smiling. Inside is a My Little Pony. She smiles with
          delight.

          A LITTLE BOY opens a present as HIS PARENTS look on,
          smiling. Inside is a G.I. Joe Hovercraft. The boy is
          overjoyed.
                         
          INT. A THIRD SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING
                         
          ANOTHER LITTLE BOY opens a present as his parents look on,
          smiling. Inside is a "Darth Vader head" action figure case.
          The boy opens it up, revealing that it's full of "Star Wars"
          action figures. The boy jumps around ecstatically.

           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           And for little John Bennett, Christmas
           Day brought a very special new arrival.
                         
          John sits amidst unwrapped gifts. We see him opening a
          present. Inside is a plush, adorable-looking teddy bear.
          The boy holds it with delight.
                         
                          JOHN
           Wow!
                         
          HIS MOM AND DAD hug him.
                         
                          JOHN'S DAD
           I guess Santa paid attention to how good
           you were this year, huh?
                         
                          JOHN'S MOM
                          (KISSING HIM)
           Merry Christmas, John.
                         
          John hugs the teddy bear. It makes a cutesy, high-
          pitched "I wuv you" sound. John gasps with delight.

          John giggles happily, squeezing the bear to make it talk,
          as his mom and dad exchange a smile.
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           I'm gonna name you Teddy.
                         
                         
          INT. JOHN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
                         
          John sits on the floor watching the 1980 film "Flash
          Gordon" on TV. He eats Twizzlers with Ted sitting next
          to him. Occasionally he gives Ted a "bite."
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           John became instantly attached to Teddy.
           There was something about that bear that
           made him feel as if he finally had a
           friend with whom he could share his
           deepest secrets.

           Hey Teddy... can I tell you something
           nobody knows?
                         
          Teddy looks back at him, expressionless.
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           Last week, my mom and dad took me to the
           park for a picnic. And they have this
           duck pond there, and... when nobody was
           looking, I pooped in my hand and threw it
           at a duck. Was that mean?
                         
          He squeezes Ted, who once again makes the "I wuv you"
          sound.
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
                          (HUGGING HIM)
           I love you too, Teddy!
                         
          John gets into bed with the teddy bear, and snuggles with
          it.
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           You know... I wish you could really talk
           to me. Because then we could be best
           friends forever and ever.

          John drifts off to sleep. The camera moves toward the
          window, and drifts outside. It pulls back from the house
          slowly.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           Now, if there's one thing you can be sure
           of... it's that nothing is more powerful
           than a young boy's wish.
                          (BEAT)
           Except an Apache helicopter. An Apache
           helicopter has machine guns and missiles.
           It is an unbelievably impressive
           complement of weaponry. An absolute
           death machine. Well, as it turned out,
           John picked the perfect night to make a
           wish.

          The camera pivots around to face the sky. We see the
          snow falling from moonlit clouds. At the center of the
          clouds, there is a small patch of open air through which
          we can see stars. Suddenly, a shooting star whizzes by
          through the opening.

          INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - SAME
                         
          John slowly opens his eyes. He turns over to face Teddy,
          but we see that Teddy is no longer next to him. John
          bolts upright and looks around, frantically.
                         
                          JOHN
           Teddy?

           Teddy?!

          John looks under the covers, but the bear is not there.
          He jumps out of bed and looks around the bed's perimeter,
          assuming that Teddy must have fallen off during the
          night. Finally, he checks underneath the bed. ANGLE
          FROM UNDERNEATH THE BED we see John looking around.
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           Teddy?
                         
          John sits up again and freezes, looking right into the
          camera, wide eyed. ANGLE ON JOHN'S P.O.V.: We see the
          face of Teddy staring right at him. Teddy blinks once.
                         
                          TEDDY
           Hug me.
                         
          John yelps and stumbles back, falling over. He stares at
          Teddy, breathing heavily.

           Yeah, I... I did wish for it.

          We see Ted getting hauled away by security. A caption
          below reads "Ted caught with mushrooms at airport
          security". He's putting up a bit of a fight, and gives
          the "finger" to the camera (the finger is pixilated).

          ANGLE ON A FACEBOOK PAGE FOR JOHN BENNETT: PAN DOWN to
          the status indicator. It reads, "In a Relationship With
          Lori Collins." An arrow clicks on her name, going to her
          page. On her wall, it reads "Lori has added 3 new photos
          in the album Mobile Uploads".

          crossed, with a deep, disapproving scowl.

          John, Lori, and Ted play miniature golf. Lori putts the
          ball, which rolls to the lip of the cup. She reacts,
          disappointed. Ted makes a graceful leg sweep, pushing
          the ball into the cup "accidentally". Lori smiles. John
          smiles back at her. Ted winks.

          each with a dab of ice cream on their noses, and a dab of
          ice cream on their upper lips.

          John and Lori paint the apartment walls. Lori sneaks up
          behind John, and paints his back. John turns around and
          grabs her. They scuffle playfully, and then kiss. We
          ANGLE ON Ted, who stands on a little stepladder hammering
          a "Home Sweet Home" picture into the wall. He steps
          back, but realizes he has nailed his hand to the wall.
          He tugs, slips, and the ladder falls. Ted hangs there
          like an idiot.

          their legs crossed, faux-pretentiously raising glasses of

          bottle on the table in front of them.

          his letters. He has spelled out the word "DOUCHE", with
          an extra B and G to spare.

          CLOSE ON a bong. PULL OUT TO REVEAL Ted, who inhales,
          his snout inside the tube. Ted sits on the sofa, and for
          the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is
          ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple
          stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's
          evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's
          been around for three decades. He and John, who sits
          next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them.
          John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too-
          worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a
          box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful,
          he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the
          remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity
          Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much,
          though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that
          this is a guy who has never really given up his
          childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. Ted
          passes the bong to John.

          drives (his paws grip the wheel). We then cut to an

          reveal it crossing Boston's huge suspension bridge.

           John, all you have to do is not fuck up,

           manager. All you have to do is not fuck
           up, and all you're doing is fucking up.
           Not that I don't think you're too fucked
           up to handle not fucking up my job, but
           you happen to be the least fucked-up
           person in the whole office. The next
           least fucked-up is Alix, and you've been
           here three fucking years longer than him.
           But I'm telling you, I will promote the
           fuck out of him if you fuck up one more

           Skerritt?

           I'll show you something I don't show too
           many people, because I don't want anyone
           treating me differently.
                         
          Thomas takes out a framed picture of himself with Tom
          Skerritt.
                         
                          THOMAS (CONT'D)
           That's me and Tom Skerritt.

                          THOMAS
           Goddamn right, wow. Now get outta here.
           I'm gonna dock you for being late, and
           for the scratch on that car. Try and be
           a little more responsible tomorrow.

          We see his coworker, Guy (a burly Patrick-Warburton
          type), handing a car key and a rental envelope to a
          pleasant-looking couple. He looks tired, disheveled, and
          a little bruised.
                         
                          GUY
           There you go, here's your key and rental

           Boston. Thanks for choosing Liberty,
           drive safely.

           I don't know, man. I got fuckin' wasted
           last night, and my phone says I texted
           somebody at 3:15 asking them to beat me
           up. And then at 4:30 I texted the same
           person saying thanks.

           Do you think you're part of some, like,
           gay beat-up underworld? Like one of

           I don't know. I dig chicks. I don't
           remember any of it, I was so fucked up.
           I might be gay, I don't know. You mind
           covering for me for a bit? I'm gonna go
           lay down in the john.

           No, it's gotta have a "ski" at the end.

          We see Lori out on the dance floor, amidst a sea of
          dancing clubgoers. Nearby, we see John dancing with a
          girl, and doing it very badly. He's putting too much
          into it, obviously trying to impress her. The girl is
          gamely tolerating it, but is clearly not digging the
          moves. John thrusts his butt back in one move,
          accidentally bumping a girl behind him with enough force
          to send her sprawling on the floor. As the crowd reacts
          to this, we see that it is Lori. She starts to get up,
          when John turns and rushes to help her to her feet.

           That's not how I remember it.

          INT. SMOKY TAVERN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
          We see John leaning against the bar, wearing a white Navy
          officer's uniform, a la Ted Stryker in "Airplane!" as
          "Stayin' Alive" blasts from the jukebox. ANGLE ON LORI,
          who is up on the dance floor, done up like Julie Hagerty.
          John takes his hat off, and tosses it O.S. coolly. He
          struts up to the dance floor, locks eyes with Lori. They
          circle one another for a beat. John suavely takes off
          his jacket, twirls it in the air a few times, and tosses
          it O.S. He then strikes a "finger up" disco pose, with a
          bullet SFX. He and Lori begin disco dancing
          simultaneously. He jumps up, locking his legs around
          Lori, who spins him around in circles, as we cut back to:

           Now I know we said no gifts, but--
                         
                          LORI
           No, we didn't.
                         
                          JOHN
           --But, I got you something anyway, in
           clear violation of the "no gift" rule.
                         
                          LORI
           There was no such rule.
          John reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small
          box. Lori looks excited.
                         
                          JOHN
           Lori, I've wanted to give this to you for
           a long time.
                         
          John slides the box over to Lori. She picks it up.
                         
                          LORI
           Oh, John.
                         
          Lori unwraps the box and opens it. Inside is a pair of
          nice, but not-super-expensive-looking earrings.
                         
                          JOHN
           Those are the ones you liked, right?
           From that kiosk at the mall?
                          LORI

           Check out the card.
                         
          She opens up the card, which we see as John describes it.
          It says, "Happy 4 year anniversary! Love you."
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)

           I know, but it's important to me that you
           have the engagement ring you deserve.
           And what with the credit bubble... the

           Look, I'm only saying this because I love
           you, but that's not realistic. You're
           never gonna have any kind of a career if
           you're always partying and wasting time

           Lori, we can't talk about this every time
           we go out. Look, he's been my best
           friend since I was eight. And I was not
           a popular child. You have to understand,
           I had no friends before he came along.
           He's the only reason I ever gained any
           fucking confidence. I coulda wound up
           like that Asian kid at Virginia Tech, but
           I didn't. `Cause of him. So, y'know,
           I'm not that psyched to just, like, kick
           him out.
                         
                          LORI

           teddy bear is the only thing that kept
           you from gunning down your classmates,
           but John, you're not eight. You're
           thirty-five. And unless you're too blind
           to notice, he's not your only friend
           anymore. You have me. And I love you.
                         
                          JOHN
           I love you, too. You know that.

           Look, I've put the best physical years of
           my life into this. I mean, I'm cute now,
           but in a few years my body's gonna fall
           off a fucking cliff. Things'll be
           hanging and stretching in ways that might
           scare a man. I need to feel secure in
           the fact that you won't leave me when
           that happens.

           be even better. `Cause I can have sex
           with you, and press your arm fat against
           a comic book so I can see it backwards.

           over there in the corner for so long.

           Lori, if I can-- now this is just
           speculation, but... is it possible that
           this is not so much about the stool in
           the corner, and more about maybe
           tonight's dinner not measuring up to your

          seems much more interested in them than in the fish.

          EXT. BOSTON COMMON - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          (Over music:) John and Ted walk across the Common,
          passing various park-goers. The occasional person
          notices and points with a "Hey, isn't that..." sort of
          look. They passes three cute girls who flag Ted down.
          Two pose with him as the third takes their picture with
          her cellphone. Ted poses for the photo with one hand on
          the girl's breast. She laughs hard. Ted waves goodbye,
          and he and John make their way over to a park bench.
          They sit. John takes out the weed, looks around for a
          beat, then starts to discreetly roll a joint.
                          TED
           Well, I'm a former celebrity with a
           minimum wage job. This must be what the
           cast of Different Strokes feels like.
                         
           O.S. VOICE
           Excuse me.
                         
          John and Ted react, startled. John stuffs the weed in
          his pocket, accidentally dropping the buds in the rolling
          papers on the ground.
                         
          ANGLE ON a creepy-looking man glancing at them
          repeatedly. This is Donny, the fat kid we saw in the
          prologue. He has grown up into a thinner but no less
          creepy man.
                         
                          DONNY
           I'm sorry to bother you, but my son and I
           couldn't help but admire your teddy bear.
                         
          ADJUST TO REVEAL his son, who looks exactly like fat
          young Donny from earlier.
                         
                          JOHN
           (a little uncomfortable)
           Oh. Um, thank you.
                         
                          DONNY
           I'm Donny. And this is my boy, Robert.
           I have to tell you, I've been fascinated
           by your story ever since I was a boy. I
           remember seeing you on the Carson show.
           You were just wonderful.
                         
          BRIEF ANGLE ON the ground, where a pigeon is pecking at
          the dropped weed.

           I wonder, is there any chance I could
           purchase the bear from you? For my son?

                          JOHN
           (leaning down to his level)
           I'm sorry, little guy, but my bear isn't
           for sale. I've had him since I was about
           your age. He's very special to me.
                         
                          ROBERT
           Sit up straight when you talk to me.
                         
                          JOHN
                          (RECOILING)
           Ew, why the fuck did he say that?
                         
                          DONNY
           Don't swear in front of my child. Now.
           We are very interested in the bear. If
           you'd like to work out some sort of
           arrangement, here's my address and phone
           number.
                         
          He writes on a slip of paper and hands it to John. John
          smiles awkwardly and puts it in his wallet.
                         
                          JOHN
           Okay. Will do. Here it goes, in the
           really important pocket for really
           important stuff.
                         
          Donny and Robert walk off. Donny turns and steals a
          glance back at Ted as they move off.
                         
                          TED

           you down to the basement and really
           slowly de-limbing you while singing some
           creepy Victorian nursery rhyme.
                         
          John tugs on one of Ted's arms trying to creep him out.
          He then breaks into a creepy falsetto.
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)

           Fuck you. Why do you have to take it so
           far? Now it's real. Fuck you again for
           that. C'mon, let's go find a better
           place to get stoned.
                         
          They exit. After a beat, the pigeon flies into frame,
          slamming right into a fucking tree.

          John and Ted walk into the building. John carries two
          cardboard boxes, and Ted carries one smaller one.
                         
                         
          INT. AN ALMOST EMPTY APARTMENT - SAME
                         
          There's a couch, a coffee table, and a couple of boxes.
          John and Ted put down their boxes, and stand just inside
          the doorway.
                          JOHN
           Well... I guess this is it, huh?

           apartment. They say they're ain't hardly
           been no murders here.
                         
          They awkwardly nod to each other, both knowing that John
          must leave soon.

          They regard each other for a moment, then John slowly
          turns and walks off down the hall. He turns back to
          smile and wave. From John's POV, we see a diminutive-
          looking Ted give a wan wave back. He looks very alone as
          the camera recedes.

           Listen... I just wanna say thank you.
           What you did with Ted was a big step, and
           I know it wasn't easy, but I just want
           you to know that I love you for it. And,
           I think this a new beginning for our
           relationship.

           Yeah. Very cute. You know what I'd like
           to do to her? Somethin' I call a Dirty
           Fozzie.
          Ted waves to the girl. She waves back. He makes a kissy
          face at her. She giggles and blows him a kiss back. He
          pantomimes hard, thrusting, standing-up sex. Her eyes
          widen for a beat, as she stares, then smiles. He grabs
          an Oh Henry bar, and pantomimes fellatio. The girl
          laughs hysterically. CLOSE ANGLE on Ted, as white liquid
          sprays all over his face from one side, then from the
          other. WIDEN to reveal he's squirting two bottles of
          pump hand soap on either side of him. The girl laughs

          John sits at his workstation, playing a TBD video game on
          his iPhone. Tanya approaches.
                         
                          TANYA
           Hey. How you holding up?
                         
                          JOHN
           Oh, I'm all right. Just... getting used
           to things, that's all.
                         
                          TANYA
           It's gonna be all right. Y'know, I went
           through something like this with my last
           boyfriend.
                          JOHN
           Really?
                         
                          TANYA
           Yeah, we were dating for eight months,
           and I was really in love with him, and
           then he was deported back to Iran. So, I
           get it.
                         
                          JOHN
           Oh... yeah. So... I guess we both lost
           our furry little guy.
                         
                          TANYA
           Yeah.
                         
          John's phone rings the theme from "Knight Rider." He
          sees Ted's name pop up, with a photo of Ted smiling open-
          mouthed at the camera, with his arms outstretched and a
          bra on his head. John picks up.

           you out, I promise. C'mon, I picked up
           the "Cheers" DVD box set, and supposedly
           everybody talks shit about each other in
           the interviews.

           much teddy bear paperwork to get through,
           it is retarded. Five minutes and you're

           I gotta duck out for a bit. Lori tried
           to break up a dog fight, and I guess she
           got hurt pretty bad.

           Yeah, she's-- that's the way she is, she
           sees trouble, she tries to help out, and
           I guess one of these dogs clamped his
           jaws on her forearm, and he wouldn't let
           go until the fireman showed up and had to
           stick his finger in his ass.
                         
                          THOMAS

                          THOMAS
           That's how they get `em to stop biting,

           Oh gosh, thank you, sir. I owe you one.

           Was there cocaine on the set of "Cheers"?

                          (LAUGHS WARMLY)
           Yes, there was quite a lot of cocaine. I

           See, I was all pissed off `cause me and
           my friend Danielle were supposed to go
           skydiving last year, but then she got
           pregnant from this asshole guy, and so we
           couldn't go and I was all upset, but then
           she had a miscarriage, and so we ended up
           getting to go skydiving, and it was so
           scary but it was so much fun.
                         
                          JOHN
           Hey, well... it sounds like everything

          Tami-Lynn laughs heartily at this, as does John. Lori
          isn't quite as delighted.

           I'm surprised John didn't tell you
           already. Seems like you guys have seen
           each other every day since you moved out.

           Well, it's funny, usually the first item
           on our agenda is "what's goin' on with
           Lori?" So I'm surprised that one slipped
           through the cracks.
                         
                          JOHN

                          JOHN
           Oh my god, remember, Ted, last week we
           were talking about... how... neat all of
           Lori's shoes are?
                         
                          TED
           That was a lengthy conversation.
                          JOHN
           And we were saying like, a lot of women
           look like unsteady horses when they wear
           high heels, but Lori has a sort of...
           regal... trot.

          She smiles at him, then:
                         
                          LORI
           Did you really just fart?
                         
                          JOHN
           Yeah, but I pushed it that way with my
           hand.
                         
                          LORI
           Oh. Wonder where it'll hit first.

          Then, a guy at a table on the right (sitting with a

          followed by his dining companions.

          INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY
          Ted's boss, Frank, emerges from the back, writing on a
          clipboard. He looks up, and his expression turns to
          confused anger as he sees an unusually long line at
          Ellen's register.
                         
                          FRANK
           What the hell?
                         
          He walks over to the line. A GUY IN LINE turns and
          notices him.
                         
           GUY IN LINE
           Hey, dude, you think you could open more
           than one register? There's like a
           thousand people here!
                         
                          FRANK
           There's supposed to be three registers
           open, for god's sake!
                         
          He looks around, aggravated, for a moment, then storms
          off toward the back. He looks around the butcher's
          counter and produce area, then walk into the back
          storeroom.
                         
                         
          INT. STOREROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Frank opens the door, and reacts with shock. REVERSE
          ANGLE where we see Ted on top of Tami Lynn, who is almost
          naked. He is doing a very close approximation of banging
          her wildly. We see his furry bear butt pumping away,
          with its little tail on the end. Frank screams in shock
          and horror.

                          FRANK
           You had sexual intercourse with a
           coworker in a storeroom filled with
           produce that we sell to the public.
                         
                          TED
           Yes.

          We see the "CLOSED" sign on the door. Ted exits,
          finishing off a bottle of beer. He walks around to the
          dumpster alley, and lines up for a Kareem-style sky hook
          shot into a trash can. He takes the shot:
                         
                          TED
           Kareem!
                         
          The bottle smashes off the side of the can, and shatters.
                         
                          TED (CONT'D)
           You suck, Kareem.
          We hear a soft footstep somewhere O.S. Ted turns and
          looks around. There appears to be no one in the
          darkness.

           Hello?
                         
          No answer. He looks around for a beat, and finds
          nothing. He turns... and finds himself facing Donny, who
          stands eerily lit by a single outdoor wall bulb.

           Well, gosh, you know, since I just
           returned from active duty in the Civil
           War, that sounds really appealing. Oh
           wait, no, that was a hundred and fifty

          d'ouvres, tables laden with lavish-looking food displays
          and floral arrangements, a 20-piece big band, and
          hundreds of guests. A large banner reads "Happy 20th

           These were John Lennon's glasses. Worth

          this.
                         
                          JOHN
           Well... that's good to hear.
                         
                          REX
           Well, that's how it is, so...there we go.
                         
                          JOHN
           Okay.

          They stand there for a beat, looking at Lance Armstrong's
          nut. John's phone rings the "Knight Rider" theme. John
          answers it.

          INTERCUT PERIODICALLY BETWEEN JOHN AND TED, who stands in
          the foreground with one finger in his ear. In the
          background, we see a party in full swing.

           John. There are moments in a man's life:
           Nathan Hale, "I regret that I have but
           one life to give for my country." Alan
           Hale, "Yes, I accept the role of the
           Skipper on `Gilligan's Island.'"

           god's sake, come share this with me.
                         
                          JOHN

          John hangs up.

           Rex. I gotta go. I'll be back in thirty
           minutes tops, but Lori cannot find out.
           She absolutely cannot know I was gone.
           If you can cover for me... we're cool on
           all that other stuff.

          John sprints out of the house and runs down the walkway.
          He leaps over a hedge toward the parking area. He slides
          across the hood of Lori's car, gets in, quickly starts
          the car, and backs out.

          can be. The party is packed with people, including Alix
          and Tanya, John's co-workers from Liberty. There are
          also a large number of booze-swilling guys and hot
          chicks. Ted runs up, wearing a blazer.

          John turns to look in the direction Ted is indicating.
          The shot slows down into slo-mo as John's eyes widen, and
          he sees...
                         
          OPPOSITE ANGLE - Across the room, SAM J. JONES turns in
          slo-mo to face John. He is inexplicably still sporting
          the same hairstyle he had in the "Flash Gordon" movie.
          We hear the theme from "Flash Gordon." We INTERCUT back
          and forth from him to John:
                         
          ON JOHN - He stands frozen in awe.
          ON SAM - He smiles as he begins to walk toward the
          camera, in John's POV.
                         
          ON JOHN - He continues to stare in frozen awe.
                         
          ON SAM - Still slowly walking toward camera in John's
          POV, but he is now dressed in the Flash Gordon costume.
                         
          ON JOHN - He continues to stare in frozen awe.

          John looks at the clock. His eyes widen in panicked
          realization.
                         
                          JOHN

          partway down the stairwell, and stops short as he sees
          Lori at the bottom, coming partway up the stairs. They
          stare at each other for a beat. She looks as hurt,
          angry, and betrayed as a woman can be.

          catches up to her and grabs her arm, but she shakes him
          off. She is clearly hurt, and on the verge of tears.

           Jesus, Lori was right. I should have
           stopped hanging out with you a long time
           ago. I'm never gonna have a life with you
           around. I'm 35 years old and I'm going
           nowhere. All I do is smoke pot and watch
           movies with a teddy fucking bear. And
           because of that, I just lost the love of

           So, word through the grapevine is you are
           newly solo. I have tickets to see Norah
           Jones at the Hatch Shell tonight, and I
           would love it if you'd go with me.

           You're asking me out the day after I
           broke up with someone.

           This is the first time you've been single
           in all the years you've worked here.
           Just go out with me one time. And if
           you're miserable and you hate it, I
           promise I will never even hint at the
           subject again. Please.

           Rex, I don't think it's smart.
                         
                          REX
           Look, I'm an asshole. I know that. It
           worked for me in high school, and it's
           been like a reflex ever since.

           (sigh) Lori, the worst that can happen is
           you have a fun, casual date with a guy
           who only wants a chance to prove to you
           that he can be something more than a
           jerk. Besides, you're a huge catch and
           it's about time somebody treated you that
           way.

          Ted stares at him for a beat, then lunges at him,
          wrapping his whole body around John's face and head, like
          the facehuggers from "Aliens." John stumbles around the
          room, trying to pry Ted off. Eventually, he stumbles
          into the bathroom, and crashes through the shower door,
          shattering it. He and Ted exchange punches to the face.
          John lands a particularly hard one, which sends Ted
          flying across the room, and slamming into the wall. Ted
          hits the floor, and runs out of the bathroom. John
          stumbles to his feet. Ted scrambles across the bed,
          reaches into the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Bible.
          John staggers out of the bathroom, just in time to be
          pelted in the head as Ted throws the Bible at him.

          Ted throws other objects at him, including beer cans and
          the phone. John and Ted stare at each other for a beat,
          each one breathing heavily (Ted is now on the floor).
          John charges at Ted, sailing across the bed, and tackling
          him, knocking over the side table and lamp in the
          process. John and Ted scuffle on the floor, engaging in
          a realistic-as-possible fistfight. Each one gets a
          number of blows in. John throws Ted off him, and back
          onto the bed. Ted taunts him.

          John jumps at Ted, throwing a jab at him. But Ted
          dodges, and John's fist goes into the wall above the
          headboard. He struggles to pull free as he flails about
          with his other hand, grabbing at Ted. Ted dodges again,
          and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the
          chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted
          to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles
          backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing
          lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall,
          and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out
          of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord
          catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from
          John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and
          cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down,
          whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the
          bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach,
          clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He
          jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the
          clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor,
          yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his
          bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks
          blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face,
          and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on.

          on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily.
          Ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over
          to him. Both breathe heavily. John's breathing
          deteriorates into sobs.

          large string section. ANGLE ON Rex and Lori, who cheer
          in the audience along with everyone else. They seem to
          be having a fantastic time.
                         
                          REX
           God, she's so brave. YOUR MUSIC IS SO
           FUCKING BRAVE!!
          Norah finishes the song.
                         
                          NORAH
           Thanks so much! We're gonna take a short
           break, but we'll be back in a few!
                         
          The crowd cheers.

          pours a drink.

           Me and Norah met in 2002 at a party at

           awkward, fuzzy sex in the coatroom.

           Okay, I'm gonna give my chops a rest here
           and invite a friend of mine up to the
           stage. He's gonna sing a song to a very
           special lady in the audience who he loves

                          LORI
           Oh my god.
                         
          John takes center stage, and looks down at Lori.
                         
                          JOHN
           Uh, hi. Um... This is for Lori Collins.
           Because I love her. This song always
           reminds me of the most important night of
           my life. The night we met. It's the
           theme song from the movie "Octopussy."
                         
          The band begins playing. "All Time High". Inexplicably,
          Norah is playing the saxophone with a pair of shades on.

           You're an asshole!
                         
          John flinches as he raises the mic stand off the floor at
          the last second, so the base is sticking out
          horizontally. The crazy guy runs right into it, bashing
          himself in the face. He goes down, unconscious and
          bleeding. Everyone gasps as the music stops.

          The crowd is now shouting angrily at John. But he is
          only focused n one spot in the crowd. He sees that Lori
          and Rex are gone. Almost oblivious to the rest of the
          frenzy, he sighs, heartbroken. A couple of concert
          security personnel haul him offstage.

           blame you. When you think about it, it
           was actually really unfair of him to
           embarrass you like that.
                         
                          LORI
           Just to be clear, I am not embarrassed.
           Listen, John and I may have our problems
           but at least he tried. You know what? I
           don't feel like talking to you about
           this.

          After a few moments, there's a knock at the door. Lori
          sighs with annoyance, and walks to the door, still in her
          towel. She looks through the peephole, but there's no
          one there. She opens the door cautiously, and looks out
          into the hall. There's no one there.

           He knows he screwed up big time, but you
           gotta believe me that is wasn't all his

           that from happening. As long as he's got
           his teddy bear, he's still a boy. And I

           I'm willing to give up the boy so you can

           here, Lori. I'm beggin' you. I'm no

          Lori emerges from the bedroom, dressed, and heads for the
          door. Ted is on the couch watching TV.

          into the kitchen. He opens the fridge.

          watches the game. After a moment, there's a knock at the
          door. Ted sighs with annoyance, and gets up.

           the street. I'd show you around, but
           it's kinda classy. They require an

           Well... I guess we can't make small talk
           all day, so I'll say what I wanna say. I
           could sit here and tell you I'm sorry, it
           was a huge misunderstanding, and I'm
           ready to change. But I don't think you
           wanna hear any of that crap. I'm not
           gonna try and get you to take me back.
           Why would you? I've been a really shitty
           boyfriend for the last four years. I
           don't deserve you. I didn't take our
           relationship seriously, even though I
           love you more than life itself. All I
           want is... just to end on good terms.
           Because I owe that to you. I want you to
           be happy... and for us to be friends.

           Well. That's pretty much it.
                         
          He takes out some money, and puts it on the table, paying
          the check. He smiles at her and walks out. She sits

          Donny's car pulls up. The house is a low-class, creepily
          shabby-looking Boston home (think Buffalo Bill in
          "Silence of the Lambs"). It's close to one end of the
          base of a bridge.

          Ted onto the floor. Ted looks around. It's just as
          shitty on the inside as on the outside. On the walls,
          there are a disturbing number of newspaper clippings,
          photo spreads, etc. Most are from press from Ted's media
          heyday, but some are photographs of Ted and John out in
          public that Donny clearly took himself.

          Ted is led into Robert's room. It's a fairly sparse room
          with some toys strewn about. A wooden rocking horse with
          a wig stands in the corner.

           if I could have a magical teddy bear,
           too. And he said no. And I was
           heartbroken. I decided that if I ever
           had a son, I would never say no to him.

          Robert sits down, covers his eyes and starts counting.

          Ted grabs a chair and starts sliding it over toward the
          door.

           Okay, no peekin', now, or you'll get kid
           cancer.
                         
          Ted reaches the door, climbs up onto the chair, and turns
          the doorknob. He opens the door, and exits out into the
          hallway. After a beat, he re-enters, grabs his severed
          ear, and exits again.

          Ted nervously moves down the hallway toward the front
          door. He has it in sight on the far end of the living
          room, but when he gets closer to the living room doorway,
          he sees that Donny is sitting in an armchair, watching
          The Incredible Hulk (the old TV show). Ted darts back
          into the hallway before he's seen, but in the process,
          bumps into a small table with a lamp and a couple knick
          knacks on it. One of them, a small ceramic penguin,
          falls over, making a sound. Donny turns and looks in the
          direction of the hallway.

          Ted looks panicky, not knowing what to do. After a beat,
          Donny leans forward as if he's about to get up.
                         
                          DONNY (CONT'D)

           Okay.
          Ted breathes a sigh of relief, and walks the other way
          down the hall. He passes a door. He opens it, but it's
          just a storage closet. He's about to shut it, but
          notices a stapler amidst the odds and ends. He hastily
          begins stapling his ear back on.

          Donny's hears something, and turns to look. We think
          he's about to get up, but he then settles back in.
                         
          ANGLE BACK ON TED, who puts on last staple in.
          Satisfied, he exits the closet and continues down the
          hall.

          Ted looks around, and spots a phone on the counter. He
          jumps up, grabs the handset, and jumps back down. He
          dials John's number.

          He pauses, then gets into the car and sits down next to
          her. She prepares to speak, but John's phone rings. He
          shuts it off without looking at it.

          John's phone rings. He looks down at it, annoyed. It
          reads "Unknown caller." He silences it.

          the sack. We can see it move as Ted struggles to get

          opens the way back door, and dumps Ted inside.

          Robert backs off in fear. Ted climbs out onto the rear
          of the car, and positions himself to make the jump. He

          Lori's car moves closer to Donny's. There's a tense

          makes the jump! He lands on the hood of Lori's car, and
          slides across, grabbing the windshield wiper to avoid
          falling off. He pulls himself back up. John and Lori
          breathe energetic sighs of relief.

          drastically reduces speed. John's car slams into Donny's
          causing Ted to go flying back through open rear window of
          Donny's car, past Robert (who is still in the way back)

          He glances at Donny, whose eyes are on the road. Ted
          grabs the club, and scrambles up the seat, taking a swing
          at Donny. Donny ducks out of the way, and tries to slap
          Ted away as Ted continues to takes swings at him. A few
          of them land, eventually drawing blood. Donny smacks Ted
          away. Ted tumbles back onto the passenger's seat. Then,
          with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in
          front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering
          wheel with a snap! Donny's eyes widen as Ted scrambles
          into the back seat. Donny tries to turn the wheel, but
          can't.

          impacts. The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop.
          Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the
          back window. He catches his fur on a jagged shard of
          glass, slightly ripping his side. He hangs and struggles
          for a bit, then drops to the ground. He sways a bit.

          That little rip has done something... He shakes it off,
          and runs up the sidewalk. ANGLE ON DONNY, who scrambles
          out of the wrecked car, followed by Robert. They chase
          Ted up the street. Ted spots a garage with the door
          slightly open. He squeezes himself underneath, and
          disappears inside.
          ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - They screech to a stop behind

          and Robert duck underneath the door. They run up the
          sidewalk after them.

          Ted runs down a ramp, looking frantically around for an
          escape route. He darts off to the left, sprinting up a
          ramp, followed by Donny and Robert. Ted stops at a red
          metal fence, and squeezes through, rushing up the stairs
          on the other side. Donny reaches the fence, but with his
          larger size he has to climb over the top, which slows him
          down a bit.
                         
          ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - We catch them ducking in through
          the garage door, and running inside. They look around

           Come on!
                         
          John and Lori run up the ramp, leaving a stunned Robert
          behind. When they reach the red fence, they look around,
          but it's unclear which way Ted and Donny have gone. John
          continues up the ramp (in the wrong direction) with Lori
          just behind him.
                         
                         
          INT. WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Ted runs as fast as his stubby legs will carry him.
          Donny is in pursuit, and getting closer. The chase moves
          past a concession area, and up a few flights of stairs.
                         
                         
          EXT. UPPER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Ted runs out onto the upper level, and stops. The camera
          PIVOTS 180 DEGREES and ascends to reveal the expanse of
          FENWAY PARK down below. A few lights are on, and one
          lone maintenance man sweeps the dirt. Donny emerges from
          the stairwell, which snaps Ted out of it. Ted sprints
          past the front row of seats, and comes to a dead end. He
          has nowhere else to go. With Donny closing in, Ted
          scurries out onto the ledge, and pulls himself up onto
          the lighting tower. He looks down. From TED'S POV, it's
          a long drop. Donny reaches out to grab him, but can't
          quite reach. Donny glances down at the drop for a beat,
          then pulls himself out onto the ledge to go after Ted.
          Ted climbs farther up the tower.

          run down the aisle, looking around with desperation.

          John turns and sees the drama playing out on the distant
          lighting tower.

          He turns and runs back up the aisle, toward the
          concession area.

          Ted is starting to gain ground, but he slips, and falls
          back down. He's about to pulls himself up again, when
          Donny grabs one of his legs.

          EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
          Ted struggles to pull himself from Donny's grasp, but he
          can't. CLOSE UP ON TED'S SIDE - The small rip from
          earlier begins to tear again. CLOSE UP ON TED'S FACE -
          His eyes go wide, and for a moment, his face freezes with
          fear. TED'S POV - His vision swims a bit more. He knows
          this is not good...

          The struggle continues. As Ted tries to pull himself
          free, the rip gets bigger. He reacts again, and again we
          see his vision swimming even more.

          but he's visibly weakened and his hands are slipping.

          Ted manages to pull free from Donny. He uses all his
          depleted strength to pull himself farther up.

          John runs past the top of the stairwell, and sprints over
          toward the lighting tower, just in time to see...
                         
                         
          EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
          Donny makes one final reach for Ted. He grabs Ted by the
          foot again, and pulls hard. With one great RRRIIIIIIP,
          Ted tears into two pieces. As John watches in shock, Ted
          falls through the air in SLO-MOTION, a shower of white
          stuffing descending with him. Lori watches with a hand
          over her mouth. The two halves of Ted land, along with
          the scattered white stuffing. Donny, still hanging,
          stares down at the fallen teddy bear. He starts pulling
          himself back over the ledge.
                         
          We lead and follow John as he runs back down through the
          stadium with desperate numbness. Lori climbs over the
          edge of the seating area, and runs toward him as well.
          ANGLE BACK ON DONNY, who pulls himself back over into the
          upper seating area. He hears the sound of a cop siren,
          and peers over the edge of the stadium. Seeing a cop car
          pull up far below, he makes a break for it.

          Down below, Ted's top half lies on the grass, looking
          around in a daze, like a badly wounded soldier for whom
          there is not much hope. John and Lori race to his side,
          and kneel down.

          J. Jones standing in robes at the altar. Ted, in a tux,
          stands in the best man's position. John stands on the

          addresses the two of them, standing at the altar.
                         
                          SAM JONES
           I now pronounce you man and wife. You
           may kiss the bride.
                         
          John and Lori kiss each other. They turn and wave to the
          cheering crowd. Ted waves happily to John, who waves
          back. John and Lori run down the aisle joyfully, passing
          pews full of people from the movie: Lori's co-workers,
          John's co-workers, (Guy sitting with HIS BOYFRIEND, Alix

          with a "Just Married" sign on the back. John gets in,
          and Lori turns to throw the bouquet toward Gina,
          Michelle, Tracy, and Tanya. Tanya catches it. She turns
          and smiles at Alix. Then suddenly, Tami-Lynn bursts into
          frame, punching Tanya in the jaw. Tanya goes down as
          Tami-Lynn tackles her, and the crowd tries to pull her
          off. ANGLE ON the limo as it pulls away...
                         
          Ted stands next to Sam J. Jones, watching with a smile as
