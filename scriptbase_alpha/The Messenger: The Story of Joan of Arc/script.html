FADE IN:

EXT.  CHURCH - DOMREMY - DAY

FADE UP on ripples on the surface of a puddle.  Slow PAN
UP:  the water becomes placid, and in it we see the
reflection of an inverted CROSS on the top of a small
church.  We move across the little churchyard and in
through the open doors.


INT.  CHURCH - DOMREMY - DAY

Utter simplicity -- stone walls, rough-hewn wooden
benches, primitive saints in the stained-glass windows --
chickens peck among the straw that covers the earthen
floor.


INT.  CONFESSIONAL BOX - CHURCH - DAY

A little wooden grill slides open and the friendly face of
the village PRIEST peers at us.  He glances about,
perplexed.

		PRIEST
	Is anybody there?

A small hand appears -- then the face of a girl aged about
10, peering up at him through the grill.  The Priest
smiles a trifle wearily.

		PRIEST
	You know I'm always happy to see
	you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here
	twice, three times a day...

		JEANNE
	I need to confess.

		PRIEST
	But you already confessed this
	morning...

		JEANNE
	I need to confess again.

		PRIEST
	So... alright.  What terrible sin
	have you committed since then that
	can't wait till tomorrow to be
	forgiven?

Jeanne climbs up on the prayer-stool to be tall enough to
look the Priest in the eye.

		JEANNE
	I saw a poor monk without shoes so I
	gave him some.

		PRIEST
	There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.

		JEANNE
	They weren't my shoes.  Mine were
	too small.

		PRIEST
	Whose were they?

		JEANNE
	My father's.

		PRIEST
	I'm sure he'll forgive you.

		JEANNE
	He already did, but I want God to
	forgive me too.

		PRIEST
	Jeanne -- if we were to ask
	forgiveness all the time, we'd spend
	our whole life in church.

		JEANNE
	Is that bad?

		PRIEST
		   (perplexed)
	Well no, but... Jeanne, are you
	happy at home?

		JEANNE
	Oh yes... very.

		PRIEST
	And your mother -- everything's fine
	with her?

		JEANNE
	Oh yes, she's... wonderful.

FLASH:  we see Jeanne's peasant MOTHER, sitting by the
fire, sewing.  Their home is little more than a hovel -- a
low, dark cave of a place, traversed by a huge beam.

		PRIEST
	Good, good.  And your sister...
	Catherine -- she's still your best
	friend?

		JEANNE
	Oh yes, my sister's just... she's...
	wonderful.

FLASH:  Jeanne's sister CATHERINE (18) sits near her
mother, spinning wool.

		PRIEST
	And what about your other friends...
	you don't like playing with them?

		JEANNE
	Oh yes, I play with them... lots...

FLASH:  Jeanne is battling against some reeds with a
wooden stick under a full noonday sun.  Not far away, a
group of kids are in the shadow of a huge tree, playing.
One of them watches Jeanne in the distance.

		KID #1
	What's she doing?

		KID #2
	Playing.

Resume on the Priest.

		PRIEST
	So... everything sounds...
	wonderful?

		JEANNE
	Yes, it is.

		PRIEST
	Then... why are you here so often?

		JEANNE
	I feel safe here.  And it's where I
	can talk to him.

		PRIEST
	Him?

		JEANNE
	Well, I try and talk to him, but
	mostly he's the one who does the
	talking.

		PRIEST
	Who is this "he"?

		JEANNE
	He never says his name.

		PRIEST
	What... does he... look like?

FLASH:  a little boy of 8, sitting on a throne in a
clearing in a wood.

		JEANNE
	Beautiful.

		PRIEST
	And what does he say to you?

FLASH:  the Boy points solemnly at us, but says nothing.

		JEANNE
	He says... he says I must be good...
	and help everyone... and take care
	of myself.  Do you think he's coming
	from the sky?

		PRIEST
	Perhaps... but wherever he comes
	from, I think you should listen to
	him, because it sounds like he's
	giving you very good advice.

The Priest smiles, and Jeanne beams back at him.  He
blesses her...

		PRIEST
	Ego te absolvo, in nomine Patris, et
	Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, Amen.


EXT.  CHURCH &amp; STREAM - DAY

Jeanne runs from the little church, the weight of her sins
now happily off her shoulders.  Her reflection skips
across a little stream, then on through a meadow of
cowslips and buttercups and up the sloping hillside
beyond...


EXT.  MEADOW &amp; WOOD - DUSK

A hazy, summer dusk -- pollen floating in the shimmering
air... Jeanne swirls between the high elms, happy and
carefree -- it's all a little surreal -- are those church
bells in the distance?  Or cow bells?  Or merely the SOUND
of insects?

Jeanne swings round faster and faster, then tumbles over,
laughing, and lies on her back.  She's dizzy and out of
breath.  Above her, the clouds seeming to swirl as though
she were still spinning round...

The SOUND of the bells slows down, deepening... Her face
moves into shadow.  Although not distinguishable as words
at this stage, there's an urgent whisper in the wind... a
strange echo that will eventually resolve into a call
"Jeanne...!"

Presently Jeanne turns and sees something glinting in the
long grass.  A SWORD.  The background SOUND of the bells
grows ominous.  A shooting star silently flashes across
the sky -- then scores of them.  She gets to her feet and
picks up the heavy sword.  It's growing darker -- colder
-- the leaves have turned to autumn brown, now blown about
by a gust of wind.

Presently she sees a WOLF approaching, slowly but straight
toward her -- then two, three -- finally the whole pack.
She grips the sword, but can't use it -- too heavy, too
frightened.  As the wolves approach, she closes her
eyes...

The wolves pass either side of her, as though oblivious to
her presence.  When she opens her eyes, they have passed,
and are now heading along the forest track.


EXT.  FOREST - NIGHT

Jeanne follows the wolves along the track.  They're
heading toward a red glow, visible beyond the trees.  The
wolves disappear over a ridge, though all we can see for
the moment is the red sky beyond.  But as Jeanne reaches
the edge, we move up with her to see...

... her village in the valley below, ablaze.


EXT.  DOMREMY VILLAGE - NIGHT

Panic -- screams -- crashing timbers -- animals stampeding
-- wolves drag corpses from gutted buildings -- and
through the midst of the tumult tears Jeanne, still
dragging the sword she found.  She runs inside a farm
cottage...


INT.  JEANNE'S HOME - NIGHT

The low, dark building we saw earlier -- now empty, lit by
the fires of the houses on the far side of the street.
Jeanne runs in, searching about --

		JEANNE
	Mother...?

No response.  She begins to panic -- runs through into a
smaller room beyond, calling out --

		JEANNE
	Catherine?!

Suddenly a door swings open and a hand reaches out --
Jeanne screams, then turns to see her elder sister,
CATHERINE, who's been hiding in a cupboard...

		CATHERINE
	Jeanne!

Catherine embraces her, hugging her in relief --

		CATHERINE
	Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?

		JEANNE
	No no, I'm fine, really...

		CATHERINE
	I was so worried -- we've all been
	looking for you!  The English are
	everywhere!  O thank you, lord!

She hugs her again -- then freezes, hearing the SOUND of
horses, the clanking of armor.  But Jeanne hasn't heard...

		JEANNE
	I was in church...

Catherine glances about, ears tuned...

		CATHERINE
	Really?

		JEANNE
	I was talking to the priest, and do
	you know what he said to me?

Catherine puts her hand across Jeanne's mouth --

		CATHERINE
	Shhh... tell me later...

She hears the drunken laughter getting closer...

		CATHERINE
	Quick -- hide in here...

		JEANNE
	What about you?

		CATHERINE
	Don't worry about me -- just stay in
	here... and don't move!

		JEANNE
	But where are you going to be?

		CATHERINE
	I'll be right here... I promise.

Catherine quickly lifts Jeanne inside the cupboard, locks
the door, then turns to confront THREE hefty ruffians
calling themselves soldiers.  The biggest and ugliest has
a jet black beard.

		BLACKBEARD
	Now that's what I call booty!

Blackbeard turns back to his comrades, who are sharing out
a roast chicken between them.  Catherine picks up the
sword dropped by Jeanne as Blackbeard swaggers up to
her...

		BLACKBEARD
	A woman with a sword?
		   (to his comrades)
	Hey, take a look at this --
	Frenchmen are such cowards that
	they've left all the fighting to
	women!

		CATHERINE
	If that's God's will, then so be it!

Blackbeard's comrades start tucking into their food,
leaving Blackbeard to his pleasure.

		BLACKBEARD
	Fine with me.  I love women.

He undoes his buckle.  From her POV behind the cupboard
door, Jeanne can just about see Blackbeard's face through
a crack.  Catherine raises the heavy sword as Blackbeard
advances, then brings it sweeping down.  But he intercepts
it effortlessly, grasping the blade as though it were a
twig...

		BLACKBEARD
	Oh... now you've hurt my feeling...

He puts his hand around her throat, rips off her little
wooden cross, pins her against the door, then, with a
lecherous roar, plunges his face on her...

Jeanne is terrified.  Blackbeard has his tunic down and is
attempting to gain entry -- Catherine tries to scream --
he slams his hand over her mouth -- she bites it --
Blackbeard howls... with laughter.  Now his juices are
really moving.  Catherine squirms against the door,
twisting and turning --

		BLACKBEARD
	Hold still, bitch.  How can I do it
	if you keep wriggling about?

He picks her up by the throat, lifts her clear off the
floor by several inches, then rams the sword clean through
her gut and the door behind her, the blade just missing
Jeanne.

		BLACKBEARD
	There, that's better.

With a grin at his comrades, Blackbeard resumes his
intercourse with the lifeless Catherine.  Behind the door,
Jeanne is suffocating with terror.

The little wooden necklace lies on the floor in f.g. as
Blackbeard pulls up his pants and turns to his comrades --

		BLACKBEARD
	Your turn.


EXT.  CHURCHYARD - VILLAGE - DAY

The little village church is no more than a smoldering
pile of rubble -- among it, the twisted stained-glass of
an angel.  Corpses are piled up alongside a warren of
shallow graves, awaiting committal.  The Priest passes by
each grave in turn, administering hasty last rites, then
moving onto the next while a harassed grave-digger fills
in the last.

Jeanne stands by a shallow grave, now wearing her sister's
wooden cross and grazing fixedly at her body, wrapped in
linen and awaiting interment.  Her parents and other
adults stand nearby, but at Jeanne's level we only see
them from the waist down.

		MAN #1 (O.S.)
	We shouldn't be doing this by
	daylight... it's too dangerous.

		MAN #2 (O.S.)
	You're right -- the English are
	still around -- I can smell them...

		MAN #3 (O.S.)
	When is the king going to do
	something?

		MAN #1 (O.S.)
	He's good for nothing...

		MAN #2 (O.S.)
	Yeah... we can't even be sure he
	really is a king...
		   (whispering)
	I heard someone say he's a
	bastard...

		MAN #1 (O.S.)
	With a mother like that?  I wouldn't
	be surprised... she's such a
	whore...

		WOMAN (O.S.)
	Can you show some respect?  We're
	burying our children.  You should be
	praying instead of cursing...

		MAN #2 (O.S.)
	That's just about all we can do.

		WOMAN (O.S.)
	Yes... because only God can help us.

Now the Priest scurries over, hurriedly mumbles the last
rites in Latin, then moves on to the next grave.  Jeanne's
family have their eyes closed in prayer, and it is only
Jeanne who sees the Grave-digger nudge the corpse into the
shallow grave with his foot.  He shovels in the earth,
then moves on.  The Father puts his hand on her shoulder.

		FATHER
	Listen, Jeanne... your Uncle and
	Aunt are taking you to their house
	for a few weeks... just to give us
	time to rebuild what we can.

Jeanne looks at him blankly, her thoughts too deep for
tears.


EXT.  VILLAGE &amp; ROAD - DAY

Jeanne sits on the back of a small hay-wagon.  Her Uncle
and Aunt are up front, eyes on the barren, devastated
countryside ahead, while Jeanne gazes fixedly on the road
behind.  From her POV:  the receding figures of her
parents, gradually merging with the dusty landscape.


INT.  DAXART'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A large, low room, almost identical to Jeanne's house:  a
bare, earthen floor with chickens running about, and a
huge cave of a fireplace.  The Aunt doles out soup from a
cauldron -- first to her husband, then to Jeanne.

		DAXART
	Lord, we give thanks for the food
	you have given us.  Teach us always
	to love this land, and to save it
	from those who seek to destroy it.
	Amen.

Jeanne says nothing -- noted by Daxart.  His wife nudges
him with a gesture to let her be.


INT.  DAXART ATTIC - NIGHT

Daxart opens the door to an attic room, his wife standing
behind him with Jeanne.  She wanders into the room, tidy
but sparse, and sits on the edge of the bed.  Daxart looks
a little put out.

		DAXART
	So... good night then.

The Aunt understands Jeanne better than her husband, and
leads him from the room.


INT.  SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

The Daxarts share the communal sleeping area with a couple
of goats and a mangy dog.  Daxart is settling down to
sleep, but his wife lies awake.

		AUNT
	What's going to happen to her?

		DAXART
	She'll be fine.  She'll grow up...
	find a good man... make him some
	children.  Don't worry -- she's been
	hurt, but she'll survive.  Tomorrow
	she'll be as right as rain, you'll
	see.


INT.  DAXART ATTIC - DAY

Daxart opens the door to the attic.  Jeanne has not moved:
she's still sitting on the bed like the day before.

		JEANNE
	I want to see a priest.


INT.  VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY

Christ, crucified in stained glass.  A silver cup is
raised in blessing...

The local PRIEST, much older than the one at Domremy,
lowers the cup, filled with wine in preparation for the
Mass.  The Daxarts enter the church at the far end, with
Jeanne between them.  The Priest is expecting her.


INT.  CONFESSIONAL BOX - DAY

Jeanne sits in the shielded darkness of the confessional
box.  She clutches at her little wooden cross and at last
begins to cry.

		PRIEST
	I heard about your sister, and I...
	understand your pain...

		JEANNE
	Why did she have to die?

		PRIEST
	Only God knows the answer to that.

		JEANNE
	I know Jesus says to love our
	enemies but I can't -- I just want
	the English to burn in hell for ever
	and ever!

		PRIEST
	I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we
	must learn to forgive.  It's hard,
	but revenge will never bring about
	peace.

		JEANNE
	Then what will?  And what will bring
	her back?  And why did she have to
	die in the first place instead of
	me?  Why didn't he take my life
	instead of hers?  It was my fault --
	I was late -- she gave me her hiding
	place...!!

		PRIEST
	Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down,
	Jeanne!

Jeanne breaks off, trembling, tears pouring down her
cheeks.

		PRIEST
	I don't pretend to know God's will,
	but I am sure of one thing -- the
	Lord always has a good reason.
	Perhaps he saved you because he
	needs you... for some higher
	calling.  So... as long as you
	answer that call, your sister will
	not have died in vain.

Jeanne clams down.  She stares at the Priest for a long
moment, and her look becomes very deep and intense.

		JEANNE
	I don't want to wait for his call.

		PRIEST
	Jeanne, be patient.

		JEANNE
	I want to be with him always...

		PRIEST
	Soon you'll be able to take the Holy
	Mass, and as you eat of his flesh
	and drink of his blood, you will be
	at one with him.

		JEANNE
	I want to be at one with Him now.


EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

On the open road, with Jeanne sitting on the back of
Daxart's wagon.  It's a grey, lowering, dismal sort of
day.  The Daxarts are up front, talking in low voices.

		DAXART
	What did he say?

		AUNT
	He says we must bring her to church
	whenever she wants.

		DAXART
	Hmmm... easy for him -- he's not the
	one that has to do the bringing.

Behind them, the wagon is empty.  Jeanne is long gone.


EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The rain pours down in torrents -- Jeanne runs...


EXT.  VILLAGE - DAY

... down the deserted road -- into the church...


INT.  VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY

... and up the aisle to the altar.  She grabs a jug of
wine, pours some into the chalice -- holds it up high as
the Priest did, then gulps it down.  The wine cascades
from her mouth like blood as she gazes up at the stained
glass image --

		JEANNE
	I want to be with you now!


INT.  DAXART HOUSE - DAWN

Daxart sits bolt upright, awaking from a nightmare.  It's
early morning, his wife still asleep beyond him.


INT./ EXT.  DAXART ATTIC/POV OF FIELD - DAWN

Daxart opens the door to Jeanne's room.  Empty, the bed
unslept in.  He walks in -- hears something.  Looking out
of the window he sees --

Jeanne in the distance, playing be herself.  Daxart
smiles.


EXT.  HOUSE &amp; FIELD - DAWN

Jeanne pauses, her stick poised in mid-air --


SUBLIMINAL FLASH --

-- a real sword impales a soldier through the stomach --
another sword slices through chain-mail -- and a severed
head encased in metal spins lose from armored shoulders...


EXT.  HOUSE &amp; FIELD - DAWN

Jeanne looks at Daxart.

		JEANNE
	I'm playing.

Once again Jeanne raises her stick-sword -- the head of a
sunflower is violently decapitated --


INT.  CHINON - STATE ROOM - DAY

-- and a sword swishes down, trying to hack someone in the
leg.  But it is only a wooden sword, and its wielder a
mere boy of five.  This is young Prince LOUIS, practicing
his nascent swordsmanship on the castle GUARDS.

VOICES and approaching footsteps alert the Guards, who
quickly stand to attention as a door is swung open...

		GUARD
	The Dauphin!

Louis takes advantage of the Guards forced immobility, and
jabs one of them in the leg... he lets out a muffled "Ow!"

The Dauphin CHARLES VII enters, followed by his courtiers.
They include the bloated REGNAULT, Archbishop of Rheims,
and Georges de la TREMOILLE -- a sly and devious diplomat.

		CHARLES
	Louis, shouldn't you be learning
	your lessons?

		LOUIS
	I don't want to learn, I want to
	fight!

		CHARLES
	You will, you will.  But for now,
	you must learn... at least to wipe
	your nose.

Charles (who speaks with a slight stutter) affectionately
wipes his son's nose with a corner of his shirt.  Beyond
them, a young soldier, Jean d'AULON, arrives with a
scroll.

		AULON
	A letter for His Majesty.

Tremoille takes it, opens the seal and begins to read.
Charles hands over Louis to a courtier...

		TREMOILLE
	Another one from this girl calling
	herself the Maiden of Lorraine.

Charles snatches it somewhat testily from Tremoille...

		CHARLES
	I can read for myself, you know.

While Charles reads, Tremoille turns aside to Regnault --

		TREMOILLE
	She pretends she's been sent by God!
	These charlatans -- it's a pity
	there isn't enough wood to burn them
	all!

		CHARLES
	She says she'll be here tomorrow...!

		TREMOILLE
	You mustn't see her, my lord.  We
	know nothing about her... we don't
	even know if she is from Lorraine.

		CHARLES
	What difference does it make where
	she comes from?

		TREMOILLE
	If she comes from Burgundy it makes
	a difference.  It might be a trap...
		   (takes back letter)
	Look... Signed "X".  What sort of
	name is "X"?  Or must we conclude
	that a messenger of God can't even
	write her own name?

		REGNAULT
	My lord Tremoille is correct.  She
	says she hears voices... she may be
	a sorceress... a witch...

		CHARLES
		   (snatching back
		    letter)
	Regnault -- you see witches
	everywhere.  She's just a peasant...
	a peasant who cares for her king.
	Look... all she wants is to help me
	win my crown... and permission to
	fight for me.

		TREMOILLE
	Not exactly.
		   (takes back letter)
	She wants you to give her an army --
	at your expanse.  Bearing in mind
	that your mother stole every last
	piece of gold in the treasury, I
	fail to see how you can afford such
	an adventure.

		CHARLES
		   (snatches back
		    letter)
	I can see her if I want to.  I mean,
	with half of France in the hands of
	the English, what have I got to
	lose?

		TREMOILLE
	The other half.

		REGNAULT
	You mustn't see her, my lord.  She
	may be an instrument of the devil.

		YOLANDE (O.S.)
	Well... I think you should.

All eyes turn to the window, where Yolande has been
standing with her back to the room, reading a little book.
Her right-arm is standing beside her -- RICHMOND, his face
hideously disfigured by battle scars.

		CHARLES
	Ah, Yolande... and what makes you
	think the exact opposite of my two
	most trusted advisors?

Yolande smiles, though hardly a devoted smile.  Mild
contempt would be more accurate.

		YOLANDE
	Because I care about you.  Come here.

Charles walks over.  He has his shirt undone.  Yolande
buttons it back up.

		YOLANDE
	Your health and happiness has always
	been my first concern, Charles...
	ever since you were a little boy --
	and I think I know you better than
	your own mother...

		CHARLES
	You think?

		YOLANDE
	Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the
	sickness that plagues your heart.  I
	know how painful it is for you... to
	have loved a father... without ever
	knowing if he really was yours.

		CHARLES
	W-w-what has that got to do with
	this Maiden?

		YOLANDE
	Who better than a messenger from God
	to give answers to your questions?

		CHARLES
	You really think she's been sent...
	by God?

		YOLANDE
	You're a fine judge of character,
	Charles.  It'll take you less than
	five minutes to expose her if she's
	a fake.  But if she's not -- then
	she will give you your answers...
	and place the crown on your head.

Charles shines at the prospect, but Tremoille and Regnault
look less than happy.

		TREMOILLE
	With respect, my lady, I think it's
	going to take more than just a
	simple peasant girl to...

		YOLANDE
	I'm not interested in what you
	think, Tremoille -- or even what I
	think.  It's what simple people
	think that matters, and the fact is
	that simple people up and down the
	country are already talking about
	her.  Now you know what simple
	people are like, always ready to
	believe any old prophecy... like
	this one about a virgin from
	Lorraine saving France...?
		   (hands Tremoille the
		    book)
	And now this girl comes along --
	from Lorraine -- and suddenly
	there's a spark of hope in their
	simple minds.  We shouldn't
	disappoint them.  If they believe in
	her -- if she can put back the fire
	in our army -- then I believe in her
	too.


EXT.  CHINON - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

Moving torches gallop toward us -- a FLAME flares through
foreground with a whoosh, PANNING ROUND as soldiers ride
toward the distant castle of Chinon -- a gloomy great
silhouette, rising against a bloody sunset...


INT.  CHINON - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

Celebrations after a hunt.  Troubadours play -- a whole
tree trunk is burning in the vast chimney.  A Page comes
running into the big room and hurries excitedly over to
Charles.

		PAGE
	She's coming, your majesty... with
	an armed escort!

		CHARLES
	Alright, alright -- calm yourself.

		TREMOILLE
	Your majesty, I urge you not to see
	this woman.  It all reeks of a
	Burgundian trap!

		CHARLES
	My astrologers assure me that the
	hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with
	Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed
	on the astrological chart how the
	Virgin is next to the Lion?

		TREMOILLE
	Supposing she's an assassin?

		CHARLES
	Tremoille, I'm not even king yet...
	who'd want to assassinate me?

Looking around at his courtiers?  They all would.


EXT.  CHINON COURTYARD - NIGHT

A FLAME swirls in the darkness -- the urgent clatter of
horses hooves -- steaming breath in the cold night air --
the SOUND of festivities coming from the castle walls
beyond -- the horses are reined -- one whinnies as
SOLDIERS jump down onto the cobbles -- a dark cape wraps
about a figure...


INT.  CHINON - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

Another page boy bursts in --

		PAGE #2
	She's arrived, my lord!  She's in
	the guards' room.

		CHARLES
	So... I suppose I'd better make a
	decision.

Charles glances between Tremoille, Regnault and Yolande,
but -- either by accident of will -- none are looking his
way.  He sighs deeply to the dashing, open-faced young
soldier we saw earlier, Jean d'AULON...

		CHARLES
	Oh dear, why is life so complicated?
	Sometimes I really wish I could be
	someone else.

		AULON
	That's a good idea, sire.

		CHARLES
	What do you mean?

		AULON
	Let someone else pretend to be you,
	and see if...

		CHARLES
	... if she can find me? -- That's a
	brilliant idea!  If she's really
	been sent by God she'll discover the
	trap, and if she's an assassin
	she'll kill the wrong man!
		   (to the page)
	Bring her up!

Charles turns to a coterie of ARMY CAPTAINS, standing
aside and aloof from the courtiers whom they evidently
despise.

		CHARLES
	My dear Captains, I've had a
	brilliant idea!  We're going to have
	a little game.  Now... let's pretend
	my throne is empty.  Who wants to be
	the king?

They all put up their hands...

		CHARLES
	Now there's a heart-warming sight!
	So let's see... which one of you
	could possibly pass as king?

He turns to the Duke of ALENCON, 25, strikingly handsome
in his bright, gilded armor.

		CHARLES
	Ah, Alencon, my noble duke, my royal
	cousin -- so fine, so brave, so rich
	-- so very rich -- so far-too-rich
	to be the King of France.  Everyone
	knows I'm the poorest man in my
	kingdom.

He turns to GILLES de Rais:  a dark, glamorous seducer,
dressed in black armor with a ring through one ear.

		CHARLES
	Gilles de Rais... Marshal of
	France... formidable to men,
	fascinating to women, feared by all.
	You'd be perfect to sit on my
	throne... so perfect that you might
	like it too much for my own piece of
	mind.

Charles turns to the bearded La Hire.

		CHARLES
	Ah, La Hire -- my angry captain...
	the bravest in France -- scarred by
	a dozen wars, but with heart and
	stomach for a dozen more.  You could
	pass for the king...

		LA HIRE
	Damn bloody right I could!

		CHARLES
	... until you opened your mouth.  No
	one with a tongue like yours could
	pass as the King of France.

The other Captains laugh heartily.

		CHARLES
	Ah well... it looks as though it's
	going to have to be me after all...
	But... wait a minute...

Charles spots the shy Jean d'Aulon.  Unlike the other
court toadies, Aulon is a quiet, honorable man.

		CHARLES
	Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon?  The
	only man who's poorer than I am, and
	so the only man I can trust.
	Dignified, honorable, wise... what
	more could we ask of a king?

		AULON
	My lord, I'm not sure that...

Charles takes his coat and puts it around Aulon's
shoulders.

		CHARLES
	My dear Aulon, to you it shall
	befall the honor of impersonating
	the royal blood!

		AULON
	Majesty, I can't...

		CHARLES
	Why, are you not ready to die for
	your king?

		AULON
	Of course I am, it's just that...

		CHARLES
	Good.  Until then, feel free to live
	like a king!

Laughter -- then the sound of approaching excitement.

		CHARLES
	Hurry, hurry -- on the throne...


INT.  CORRIDOR - CHINON - NIGHT

Armored feet clank along a stone corridor --


INT.  GREAT HALL - CHINON - NIGHT

Charles unceremoniously dumps Aulon on the throne...

		AULON
	Sire, you know how bad I am at this
	sort of game.

		CHARLES
	So... pretend it's not a game.

Charles abandons Aulon and disappears among his courtiers.
A pair of PAGE BOYS swing open the doors:  the courtiers
turn expectantly; Aulon tries to pose as the king.

From the Court's POV, a girl of 17 enters the great hall,
dressed in a grubby tunic, with long hair tied back
beneath a hood.  There could not be a more striking
contrast than the sophisticated, opulent, yet cowardly
courtiers and this naive, rough girl, almost childlike in
her simplicity, and yet so focused, so confident, so
secure in her mission, with a courage that radiates
conviction, and is contagious.

The courtiers step back to form a narrow channel as she
moves into the great hall.  Yolande marks the effect her
presence has on the court, smiling at their bemused gazes.

Jeanne passes the Archbishop, who defends himself by
sprinkling holy water in her path.  Tremoille oils his way
toward her with a can-I-help ingratiating smile...

		JEANNE
	I have come to see the Dauphin.

Tremoille nods obsequiously, ushering her toward Aulon,
who is now visibly uneasy.  Jeanne stops in front of him.
Aulon gazes at her.  Jeanne scans him a couple of times,
looks at him stonily.  Then smiles.  Aulon melts, his
cheeks blushing hot.  Jeanne cocks her head, like an
inquisitive child.

		JEANNE
	Who are you?

Aulon stammers in response...

		AULON
	I'm... I'm... I'm...

		TREMOILLE
	... His most gracious majesty
	Charles de Valois, Dauphin of
	France...

She gives Aulon another smile.

		JEANNE
	I can see you are a good man, but
	you're not the Dauphin.
		   (to Tremoille)
	I'm sorry to insist, but we have no
	time to lose.  I must see the
	Dauphin.  Where is he?

		TREMOILLE
	He's here.
		   (a gracious gesture)
	Find him yourself.

A brief pause, then Jeanne takes up the challenge.  She
moves on, examining the faces acutely.  Although a few of
the wimpoled ladies find her simple peasant dress amusing,
most are caught like moths in her flame.  She notices the
Three Captains (La Hire, Alencon and Gilles de Rais)
edging closer together, as though shielding someone
beyond.

Jeanne approaches them -- they draw closer together, but
now we can see Charles, overtly curious, yet anxious to
remain hidden.  His inquisitiveness wins -- but as Jeanne
walks up to him, the Three Captains spring in front of
her, swords drawn, the tips pressing at her throat...

		JEANNE
	There's no need to be afraid, sire.

		CHARLES
	I'm... I'm not the king...

		JEANNE
	I know you're not yet -- but you
	will be, soon.

Charles makes a gesture, and the soldiers cautiously
sheath their swords.

		CHARLES
	H-h-how did you know who I am?

		ALENCON
	Her voices, of course...

		GILLES
	"That's him" they said, "The one
	with the big nose and bags under his
	eyes."

They laugh -- whereupon Jeanne rushes at Charles and
flings herself on her knees, embracing him round the
ankles.

Charles screams -- the 3 Captains redraw their swords --
the court gasps -- then Charles gestures the Captains to
back off.

		JEANNE
	My gentle Dauphin, I bring you good
	news.

Charles puts out his hand to her, allowing her to rise.
She draws close to him, whispering...

		JEANNE
	It is a message from the King of
	Heaven.  For you -- and you only.

Jeanne speaks with such conviction that it seems
unnecessary to doubt her.  Her mesmeric effect on Charles
is being noticed by his courtiers.  He hesitates a moment,
then --

		CHARLES
	Follow me.

He leads her from the room.  Tremoille hurriedly follows
them.  Charles turns round in the doorway, barring him
further access.

		TREMOILLE
	Your majesty, I really think you...

		CHARLES
	My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I
	can count on you...

		TREMOILLE
	... as always, majesty...

		CHARLES
	... to ensure our privacy.  I need
	to talk to her.  Alone.

Tremoille looks non-plussed.

		TREMOILLE
	As you wish, majesty.

Charles disappears with Jeanne.

Tremoille ire at being barred is mollified by blocking the
path of Yolande.

		TREMOILLE
	He needs to talk to her.  Alone.


INT.  CASTLE - KING'S CHAMBER - DAY

Jeanne is seated facing Charles in front of a huge fire.
As the scene unfolds, their faces draw closer and closer.
Her voice is soft and sweet, but her conviction is
absolute.

		JEANNE
	I was about eight years old.  It was
	a beautiful spring day.  I was in
	the forest taking a short cut home
	when the wind started blowing in the
	trees -- such a strange sound --
	almost like words -- as if someone
	was calling...

FLASH:  The little BOY seen earlier is seated on his chair
in the middle of the field, pointing his finger at us --


INT.  CASTLE - KING'S CHAMBER - DAY

Charles is intrigued...

		JEANNE
	The second time was many years
	later.  It was autumn, and I was
	coming back from church when
	suddenly the same violent wind
	started to blow again...


EXT.  FIELD - SFX - DAY

FLASH:  The wind lifts Jeanne (17) from the ground, spins
her forward and flattens her on her back, her arms
outstretched, Her face gazing upward at the sky...

		JEANNE (O.S.)
	Everything was moving so fast -- the
	wind -- the clouds -- I couldn't
	move!  Then suddenly a shape
	appeared in the middle of the sky...

The fast-moving CLOUDS resolve themselves into the shape
of a face... the face of an OLD MAN.  He opens his mouth
wide, radiating a shaft of sunlight that strikes Jeanne,
still lying in the field.  The old man's mouth seems to
form the word "Jeanne", but the sound that emanates is so
vast that we can't be sure.

Suddenly the mouth snaps shut, releasing a huge FLASH OF
LIGHT --


INT.  CASTLE - KING'S CHAMBER - DAY

-- Charles jumps back, startled yet totally absorbed.
Jeanne's eyes sparkle with tears --

		JEANNE
	I was so frightened... he was so --
	so here...

FLASH:  The Boy is still sitting in his forest seat, but
now he is a beautiful young Man, pointing his finger at
Jeanne --

		JEANNE (O.S.)
	I realized then that he had chosen
	me, but I didn't understand what it
	was I had to do...

Jeanne's eyes sparkle with intensity...

		JEANNE
	What was my mission?  To help my
	country?  But how could I do that?
	I was only a poor girl who knew
	nothing about riding or making
	war... so I decided to wait and not
	to speak to anyone about it.

		CHARLES
	You did well...

		JEANNE
	I didn't wait long.  One day I was
	going to Mass, like I do every day,
	when the same strange wind started
	blowing again...


INT./ EXT.  CHURCH - SFX

The double doors of a church are blown open by wind coming
from inside -- right in front of Jeanne!  Surreal shafts
of light criss-cross the interior from the stained-glass
windows, illuminating Jeanne in myriad hues and colors.

She sways uneasily as the central stained-glass window
above the altar starts to warp and undulate, like heat
waves creating a mirage.  The image of a beautiful
archangel slowly comes to life, stepping out from the
window frame, then moving toward Jeanne...

		JEANNE
	Everything was suddenly made clear
	to me.  God was finally calling me.
	He had a mission for me -- a message
	to deliver...

The Archangel opens his arms to Jeanne as though to
embrace her.  She drops to her knees, opening her arms and
-- FLASH --


INT.  CASTLE - KING'S CHAMBER - DAY

Charles is in suspense, his face sweating...

		CHARLES
	... and what... what did he say?

		JEANNE
	He said that I have to save France
	from her enemies and give her back
	to God, and He told me that I --
	Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar
	at Rheims to be crowned King of
	France.

Charles slowly releases the breath he's been holding --
and the brimming tears run down his cheeks.  Jeanne takes
his hand and places it on her own damp cheek...

		JEANNE
	All you have to do now is put your
	trust in me.

Jeanne kisses his hands, and Charles is almost overcome
with emotion.  He seems, for the first time, utterly
defenseless, like the little hurt boy that he is.

		CHARLES
	I trust you, Jeanne -- I do -- and
	I envy your certainty, but how can I
	be certain that I have the right to
	call myself king when I don't even
	know who my father is.  My mother
	can't even remember... I -- I need
	to know...

Jeanne gazes at him a moment, then places her hands either
side of his head and draws him slowly forward until both
their foreheads are touching...

FLASHES:

A series of too-perfect images:

1:  A BELL comes crashing down on top of us --

2:  The ROYAL BANNER flies triumphantly in the wind --

3:  English CAPTAINS throw down their weapons and kneel in
   submission before Charles --

4:  Huge city GATES swing open, releasing a jubilant crowd
   who welcome the King in triumph --

5:  CHARLES kneels in Rheims Cathedral --

6:  Bejeweled HANDS place the CROWN of France on his
   head --


INT.  CHINON - KING'S CHAMBER - DAY

Jeanne's hands hold Charles' head, as though she has just
crowned him.  For Charles, the fantasy has become reality.

		JEANNE
	Do you really believe that God would
	let all this happen... if you were
	not the true King of France?


INT.  CASTLE - GREAT HALL - DAY

The Courtiers talk among themselves, nervously awaiting
Charles to rejoin them.  Presently the door opens and
Charles emerges, followed by Jeanne.  He is a man
transfigured.  Tremoille looks anxious.  Charles glances
at them, their expectant eyes awaiting his verdict.  He
leads Jeanne across to Aulon.

		CHARLES
	Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my
	loyal friend and finest archer, Jean
	d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in
	your care.  Find her suitable
	lodgings -- here -- in the castle...
	and guard her with your life.

		AULON
	Yes, my lord.

		JEANNE
	I don't need lodgings if we're to be
	marching on Orleans...

		CHARLES
	Orleans has held out for six months.
	I don't suppose a few days will make
	much difference.  Take some rest.

Jeanne follows Jean d'Aulon from the Great Hall, watched
in silence by his courtiers.  As soon as she's gone, the
whole room is filled with the myriad buzz of opinion.
Gilles gives Charles the eye...

		GILLES
	She certainly cast a spell on you.

Charles draws his three Captains aside.

		CHARLES
	She'll cast her spell on everyone if
	she's given half a chance... and we
	must ensure that she gets that
	chance.

The Captains look astonished.

		CHARLES
	Can you imagine the effect it will
	have on the English -- to see a girl
	riding at the head of our army?

		LA HIRE
	Yes.  They'll bleeding wet
	themselves!  Laughing.

		GILLES
	We're not your favorite captains
	anymore??

		CHARLES
	No -- I mean yes! -- of course...

		ALENCON
	Charles... you want to give the
	command of our army to a -- woman??

		CHARLES
	Of course not!  You're the ones in
	command, as always... but if she can
	put back the fire in our soldiers,
	then maybe you, my dear Captains,
	will be able to raise the siege of
	Orleans.  What do you think?

		GILLES
	Brilliant idea... but to be really
	effective, why not send a whole army
	of virgins?

		LA HIRE
	That'll put fire in my soldiers!

The Captains laugh -- at Charles' expense.

		CHARLES
	Please, my friends... you know me...
	you know how certain I am about
	everything, but -- maybe for the
	first time in my life I -- I don't
	know why -- but I feel I have to
	trust her... and now I'm asking you
	-- I'm begging you -- to trust me...


INT.  ROOM - CHINON CASTLE - DAY

Jeanne blows the dust from a wooden crucifix, then
replaces it above a bed.  Jean d'Aulon has brought her to
a small room in one of the castle's turrets:  clean,
plainly furnished, but hardly hospitable.  Jeanne inspects
the room while Aulon stands by the door.

		AULON
	Listen, please accept my apologies
	for... you know, me pretending to be
	the... well it wasn't really my
	idea... well, yes it was my idea
	but...

		JEANNE
	Do you think I could have some
	water?

Jeanne smiles sweetly, catching Aulon off guard.

		AULON
	Yes, of course... water... anything
	else?

Two page boys run into the room, carrying luggage, water,
washing bowl and some food.  They are LOUIS and RAYMOND,
both 13, as inseparable as they are loyal.  Jeanne looks
up, then sits on the bed, testing the horsehair mattress.

		JEANNE
	I would like some fresh straw.

		AULON
	Louis... water and fresh straw!

Louis goes running off.

		JEANNE
	And I would like to see a priest.

		AULON
	Now?

		JEANNE
	Yes.  I didn't confess today.

		AULON
	Right.
		   (to Raymond)
	Raymond... a priest.

Raymond goes running off.

		JEANNE
	I shall also be needing a war horse
	-- mine is too slow -- and armor --
	and a good sword -- and an artist to
	make me a banner.

		AULON
	Now?

		JEANNE
	Better today than tomorrow.

		AULON
	Well... uh -- this might take a
	little time -- but let me see what I
	can do.

He's about to leave when Jeanne adds --

		JEANNE
	I also need someone who can read and
	write.

		AULON
	This I can do.
		   (Jeanne looks
		    surprised)
	I was studying at the University of
	Paris -- till the English invaded
	it.

		JEANNE
	I thought you were an archer?

		AULON
	Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can
	read and write.  Who do you want to
	write to?

		JEANNE
	The King of England.  I want to give
	them the chance to leave Orleans in
	peace before I get there.

Aulon just stares at her.


INT.  GUARD HOUSE - CHINON - DAWN

Raymond hands a rolled parchment to a Rider, already
mounted and waiting...


EXT.  CHINON CASTLE &amp; MEADOW - DAWN

The Rider gallops over the drawbridge and away.


EXT.  CHINON - TERRACE - DAY

Tremoille stands on a terrace before Chinon, watching the
rider heading down the dusty highway.

		TREMOILLE
	I can't believe you let her send
	such a letter...

Charles is a short distance away, watching Jeanne in a
meadow below the castle, swishing a stick from side to
side.

		CHARLES
	She's going to do it.

Tremoille exchanges a worried glance with Archbishop
Regnault, who is standing behind Charles.

		REGNAULT
	Sire, it's going to take more than a
	letter to drive out the English.

		TREMOILLE
	An army for instance...

		CHARLES
	My captains have sworn their
	support.

		TREMOILLE
	No doubt your captains will fight
	for your fine cause -- but what
	about the ordinary soldier?  They
	don't fight for causes these days.
	They fight for money.  Who's going
	to pay them?

		YOLANDE (O.S.)
	I am.

Yolande moves forward, accompanied by her daughter Mary
(Charles' wife) and grandson, young Louis.

		CHARLES
	You will??

		YOLANDE
	For the sake of France, Charles.
	And for the sake of my grandson.

She pats Louis on the head.

		TREMOILLE
	With respect, my lady -- the
	Archbishop and I have begun delicate
	negotiations with the Burgundians.
	If we can bring them over to our
	side...

		YOLANDE
	Negotiate by all means, but from a
	position of strength.  If the
	English take Orleans, there'll be
	nothing left to negotiate -- the
	rest of the country will be theirs.

		TREMOILLE
	My lady, it would be the height of
	folly to let this... child... lead
	our army in the king's name without
	first verifying her true motives.

		REGNAULT
	Tremoille is right.  This girl must
	be subjected to a rigorous
	examination by the Doctors of the
	Church at Poitiers.  We need to be
	absolutely certain that she is not
	an instrument of the devil.

		CHARLES
	How can anyone be absolutely certain
	about anything?  Our intuitions are
	sometimes our best counselors...

		REGNAULT
	We must listen to Mother Holy Church
	before listening to our intuitions.

		TREMOILLE
	Wait... she claims to be a virgin...
	Well that's something we can examine
	-- and be absolutely certain about.

Charles hesitates -- turns to Yolande, who looks somewhat
uneasy at the suggestion.

		YOLANDE
	Why not?

Charles looks across to Jeanne in the distance, still
playing with her stick.  Suddenly she swipes at a bulrush,
violently decapitating its head.  Charles looks worried.

		CHARLES
	Let's find out.


INT.  POITIERS UNIVERSITY - ROOM - NIGHT

A big, spacious room, into which files a procession of TEN
DOCTORS of THEOLOGY and TEN NOTABLES, walking two-by-two.
They divide either side of CAMERA, then halt and about-
turn, facing inward with military precision.  Two PAGE
BOYS set up screens in front of the two rows, preventing
them from viewing Jeanne, who is standing on a low table
between the rows, wearing a laced-up robe.

Now a procession of NUNS form up behind the table.  Two of
them step forward, on cue, then proceed to loosen the
laces of Jeanne's robe and roll up the hem.  Meanwhile an
old HAG is washing her hands.

With Jeanne suitably prepared, the old HAG stands in front
of her.  Two little Girls slip in a special stool and the
old HAG squats down, enabling her to look between Jeanne's
legs.  Only women are privy to this ritualistic
inspection; the men remain standing behind the screens.

Yolande waits with the disfigured Richmond near a window.
The old Hag is certainly taking her time, and Yolande is
getting decidedly nervous...

		RICHMOND
		   (whispering)
	What if she's not?

		YOLANDE
	I'll kill her myself...

A few tense moments -- then the ancient HAG announces with
great solemnity...

		HAG
	There is no sign of corruption or
	violation.  She is intact.

... to Yolande's visible relief.


INT.  COUNCIL ROOM - POITIERS UNIVERSITY - DAY

A dark, musty council room, where theologians and learned
doctors of the Church sit in wooden tiers, examining
Jeanne.  Archbishop Regnault is among them.  So too is
Jean d'Aulon -- but he as a silent, albeit supportive
observer.

Jeanne stands in the center of the room, hands folded, as
though on trial.  She's evidently been here many hours.

		INQUISITOR #1
	And... what exactly was this --
	"vision" -- wearing?

		JEANNE
	I don't remember.

		INQUISITOR #2
	Was it wearing a crown?

		JEANNE
	I saw no crown.

		INQUISITOR #3
	Well, was it naked?

The Court have a good chuckle.

		JEANNE
	Do you think that God can't afford
	to give him clothes?

An audible reaction, somewhere between amusement and
admiration.  A deadpan scribe carefully writes down both
questions and answers in a large, vellum-bound book.

		INQUISITOR #1
	Did this -- vision -- give you
	anything -- an object, like a ring,
	or a rosary or anything -- by which
	we can verify your claim?

		JEANNE
	He gave me good advice.

		INQUISITOR #4
	During your childhood, did you have
	any sort of military experience?

		JEANNE
	No.

		INQUISITOR
	Are you practiced in the skills of
	swordsmanship?

		JEANNE
	No.  But I'm good with a stick.

A murmur of laughter, though not from us.

		INQUISITOR #4
	Do you know what a Dijon Culverin
	is?

		JEANNE
	No.

		INQUISITOR #4
	It's an item of artillery.  How do
	you expect to raise the siege of
	Orleans if you are ignorant about
	modern artillery?

		JEANNE
	The road to Orleans is long, and I
	have good captains with me.  I will
	learn fast, believe me.

The Inquisitor and his colleagues whisper in a huddle.
Regnault remains unconvinced, and indicates his strong
reservations.  Finally the Chief Inquisitor addresses
Jeanne.

		CHIEF INQUISITOR
	We would like to believe you Jeanne,
	but we feel that if God were to want
	us to believe in you, he would have
	sent you with a sign as proof that
	we should believe in you.  We cannot
	advise the King to entrust you with
	the army merely on your assertion.
	Can't you do something?  Or show us
	something?  Some sign to prove that
	you are sent by God?

		JEANNE
	Sire, I did not come here to preform
	tricks.  You are all much cleverer
	than I am -- me, I don't know A from
	B -- but this much I do know:  that
	while the people of France lie
	bleeding, you sit around in your
	fine clothes trying to deceive me --
	yet all you're doing is deceiving
	yourselves.  You say you are men of
	God, yet you can't see His hand in
	having guided me safely through
	five hundred leagues of enemy
	country to bring you His help?  Is
	that not proof enough?  Or do you
	want still more signs?  Give me
	command of an army, take me to
	Orleans, and there you will see the
	sign I was sent to make!

Aulon can barely restrain himself from applauding.  The
Chief Inquisitor reaches his decision, raises his gavel
and --


EXT.  LES TOURELLES - ORLEANS - DAY

-- down comes a mallet, SLAMMING out a safety wedge which
releases a CATAPULT -- and a huge boulder flies across the
river in the direction of Orleans...


EXT.  BATTLEMENTS - ORLEANS - DAY

A LOOK-OUT spots the incoming missile -- yells out --

		GAMACHE
	45-er, nor-nor-west -- straight at
	us!


INT.  DUNOIS' HQ - ORLEANS - DAY

DUNOIS is alone, writing a letter at a small table --

		DUNOIS
	Which side's that?

		GAMACHE (O.S.)
	Window side...!!

Dunois realizes he's near the window and dives for cover
just as the massive boulder plummets through the ceiling,
demolishing the table where he'd been sitting seconds
before, and leaving a huge hole in the wall.

Dunois emerges from under a large table, dusting himself.
He looks thin, haggard and exhausted after six months of
siege.

Suddenly a young soldier -- Poton de XAINTRAILLES -- comes
bursting in, ignoring the mess...

		XAINTRAILLES
	My lord Dunois... I have wonderful
	news! -- finally -- he's sending
	her to us -- thanks be to God --
	we're saved -- it's wonderful!

		DUNOIS
	Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now
	slowly.  Who has finally done what?

		XAINTRAILLES
	The Dauphin -- he's sending us food
	-- and supplies -- and an army --
	led by Jeanne -- the maiden from
	Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!

		DUNOIS
		   (deadpan)
	Yes, it's a miracle.

		XAINTRAILLES
	And it's not the first one!  They
	say she saved a little boy who was
	dying of...

		DUNOIS
	Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me
	about miracles...
		   (pointing to hole in
		    floor)
	If I was still sitting there waiting
	for a miracle, I'd be dead now.
	Anyway...

Dunois looks up at the sky, now visible through a hole in
the roof.

		XAINTRAILLES
	But... don't you think we should at
	least... go and... welcome her?

		DUNOIS
		   (sighs)
	As long as she brings food and
	supplies, she'll be welcome.


EXT.  RIVER BANK &amp; POV OF ORLEANS - DAY

The walled city of Orleans stands in the distance on the
far side of the river Loire.  CAMERA CRANES DOWN to find
Dunois, Xaintrailles and a small escort of soldiers,
waiting atop a ridge where they're evidently been for some
time.

		GAMACHE
	I can't believe they're sending a
	woman.

		DUNOIS
	Maybe they never sent anyone.

TRAVELING SHOT:  Horse's hooves galloping...

		GAMACHE
	I wonder what color dress she'll be
	wearing?

TRAVELING SHOT:  Horse's breath steaming...

		GAMACHE
	I'll wager red -- how about you?

		DUNOIS
	Blue...

TRAVELING SHOT:  Stirrups press into the horse's flanks...

		DUNOIS
	... with a blue ribbon in her hair
	to tie up Talbot!

TRAVELING SHOT:  the horse's eyes, wild and dilated...

		DUNOIS
	Does anyone know if she even knows
	how to ride a horse?

TRAVELING SHOT:  horse's legs at the triple gallop...

		XAINTRAILLES
	She knows...

THEIR POV:  a white banner sweeps into SHOT -- then a
knight clad in shinning white armor.  The knight raises
his visor to reveal -- Jeanne, her face gleaming with
sweat, eyes blazing.  Dunois is speechless.

		JEANNE
	Were you sent by Lord Dunois?

		DUNOIS
	Yes... they were.

		JEANNE
	Good.  Where are the English?

		DUNOIS
	Everywhere.  Where is the food?

		JEANNE
	It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I
	have to speak with the Captain of
	the English army... his name's
	Talbot...

		DUNOIS
	I know...

		JEANNE
	Good.  Can you bring me to him?

		DUNOIS
	He's on the other side of the river.

Now La Hire and Gilles de Rais ride into view...

		JEANNE
	So who gave the order to bring me to
	this side of the river??

		LA HIRE
		   (calling to Dunois)
	Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see
	your ugly damn face again!

		JEANNE
	La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't
	swear!

		LA HIRE
	Sorry Jeanne...
		   (to Dunois)
	Did you both meet already?

		DUNOIS
	Well... sort of...

		GILLES
		   (to Dunois, smiling)
	She's quite something, huh?

		LA HIRE
	Jeanne, let me introduce the king's
	half brother, the dogged Lord
	Dunois.

		JEANNE
	Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way
	to the other side of the river...

She starts to move as Jean d'Aulon rides up --

		DUNOIS
	Wait, wait...

		JEANNE
	For what?

		DUNOIS
	Because... because -- I mean -- the
	English have a broad sense of humor,
	but... I mean, you don't
	understand... to them you're a
	witch, working for the devil.  What
	makes you think they'll listen to
	you?

		JEANNE
	Because if they don't, I'll raise
	such a war-cry against them that
	they will remember us forever!

		DUNOIS
	Well.  I'd love to see that, but
	after taking counsel with my
	captains, I felt it would be better
	to first bring the food into the
	city, then wait till Alencon arrives
	with reinforcements before doing
	anything.

		JEANNE
	You may have been with your counsel,
	but I've been with mine, and I'm
	telling you, God's counsel is wiser
	than yours, and he's telling me to
	speak to the English -- now!

		DUNOIS
		   (matching her anger)
	Fine -- go now if you want, but not
	with me!  You may have a duty to God
	but I have a duty to my people, and
	my people are starving!  So right
	now I'm going to take the food back
	to the city, and if you can please
	calm down, and let me accompany you
	to Orleans, it will be my honor to
	welcome you.

Gilles smiles at Jeanne's evident frustration.


EXT.  EAST GATE - STREET &amp; SQUARE - ORLEANS - DUSK

The battered east gate of Orleans swings open, and a
convoy of wagons enter the town, guarded by soldiers.
Jeanne and the Captains are on horseback, the remainder on
foot.

A group of hungry children spot the arrival, their eyes
widening at the sight of the food:  beef, mutton,
chickens, sacks of grain, barrels of salted fish...

But most of the citizens are too starved and too weary to
show much excitement; hollow-eyed and emaciated, they have
the expressionless faces of concentration camp inmates.
La Hire is sickened at the sight...

		LA HIRE
	Jesus Christ... the goddamn English
	will pay for this!

		JEANNE
	They will -- and so will you if you
	go on swearing like that.

By the time the little procession has reached the main
square, a CROWD has gathered.  Sluggishly they make way
for Jeanne and Dunois to ride between them...

Now the interest in Jeanne begins to warm up -- the CROWD
press in on her.  Slowly at first, but with increasing
fervor, the pressure builds as the crowd  try to touch
her.

		CROWD
	Bless us, Jeanne...!  Save us!


EXT.  JEANNE'S HOUSE - ORLEANS - NIGHT

Soldiers push back the crowd, allowing Jeanne to reach a
large gabled house.  As she dismounts, a woman runs
forward --

		WOMAN
	Jeanne!  Bless her -- touch her!

The woman holds up her BABY for Jeanne to touch.

		JEANNE
	Touch her yourself... your touch is
	just as good as mine.

		WOMAN
	But... you've been sent by God!

		JEANNE
	So has everyone.

Jeanne turns sharply away and walks inside the house,
followed by Aulon and the others.


INT.  HQ - ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT

A frustrated Jeanne marches into Dunois' new war-room.
Dunois enters, followed by his Captains, and is happy to
see a model of Orleans...

		DUNOIS
	La Hire, Gilles -- let me show you
	something...

The Captains go into a huddle, leaving Jeanne smarting.
She looks out of the window, where the crowd is still
trying to catch a glimpse of her.

		JEANNE
	Who do they think I am?!

		AULON
	Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame
	the people -- they've been hearing
	all about you for weeks.

		JEANNE
	There's nothing to hear -- I haven't
	done anything.  And why haven't I
	done anything?
		   (turning to the
		    captains)
	Because none of you will listen to
	me!!

She shouts in frustration, and Dunois and the other
captains swing round.  Dunois waits for the echo to die
away.

		DUNOIS
	Would you like to join us?  We're
	about to discuss the campaign...

Jeanne walks over, still vexed.  Using the model, Dunois
continues his situation briefing.

		DUNOIS
	From here, Talbot has spread his
	forces between these forts up here,
	but in the last few days it seems --
	according to our scouts -- that some
	troops have been deployed to this
	fort here -- which makes me think
	that this is where they'll be
	launching their attack from...

Dunois points to St. Loup -- a smaller fort to the east.

		GILLES
	I would have thought they'd have
	attacked from here, where Talbot is.

		DUNOIS
	I doubt it.  From here they won't be
	able to utilize the river, whereas
	over here the current will be with
	them.

		LA HIRE
	What about this huge pile down here?

		DUNOIS
	That's the Tourelles.  The English
	were planning to launch an attack
	from it, but then we broke down the
	bridge, which should keep them quiet
	for a while.  My hunch is, the
	attack will come from St. Loup.

He pauses, then turns to Jeanne, somewhat apprehensively.

		GILLES
	And... what does Jeanne think?

		JEANNE
	I don't think.  I leave that to God.
	I'm nothing in all this, I'm just
	the messenger.

		DUNOIS
	So... what is the message?

		JEANNE
	We offer the English a last chance
	to return home in peace.  If they
	refuse, we recross the river and
	attack them here -- at the
	Tourelles.

They all look astonished.  Gilles grins.

		DUNOIS
	Jeanne, that really makes no sense
	at all.  The Tourelles is virtually
	impregnable... besides, if we're on
	the other side of the river
	attacking the Tourelles, what's to
	stop Talbot attacking the city from
	the north?

		JEANNE
	God.

		GILLES
	God... why of course -- we'd
	forgotten about him!  Strange, I
	don't seem to remember seeing him at
	Agincourt.

		LA HIRE
	Damn right!

		GILLES
	Oh, but I forgot!  It was a
	Sunday... that explains it.  God's
	day off.

They all laugh, apart from Aulon and the page boys.

		JEANNE
	You know, I feel a great sorrow for
	you, because you're laughing now,
	but by tomorrow night some of you
	will be dead and having to repeat
	your jokes in front of God.

		DUNOIS
	Jeanne, with respect -- we can't
	just attack the Tourelles like that
	-- it's a very complicated matter
	and...

		JEANNE
	What complicated about it?  All you
	have to do is do what you're told --
	what could be simpler than that?
	I'm the drum on which God is beating
	out his message -- beating so loudly
	it's bursting my ears -- but you're
	all so full of your own voices,
	you're deaf to His!

		AULON
	Jeanne, be patient...

Jeanne turns on him --

		JEANNE
	"Be patient, be patient"... is that
	the only advice you can ever come up
	with??  I've shown more patience
	than a dozen saints!

		DUNOIS
	Jeanne, you have to understand --
	it's not easy for us -- I mean for
	our pride -- to suddenly be usurped
	by a -- well, with all due respect,
	by a... girl.

		JEANNE
	Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a
	girl.

		DUNOIS
	Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for
	a moment -- how would you feel, if
	you were me?

		JEANNE
	Knowing what I know?  Enormous
	gratitude.

Jeanne turns and heads for the door.  La Hire nudges
Gilles as she approaches --

		LA HIRE
	One hell of a girl, huh?

As she passes, Jeanne slaps La Hire right across the
face --

		JEANNE
	I warned you!

-- and walk out, slamming the door behind her.  The others
stare after her, while La Hire nurses his cheek.

		GILLES
		   (to La Hire)
	I do love her when her fire gets
	well and truly stoked!

		LA HIRE
	Me too...

A pause, then the door at the other end of the room bursts
open and in walks the expansive Duke of Alencon.

		ALENCON
	Hello my friends!  What a journey,
	but we made it!  Back together
	again... let's have some fun!

He rubs his hands in anticipation, then notes his
comrades' expressions, still recovering from Jeanne's
outburst.

		ALENCON
	Did I miss something?


INT.  JEANNE'S BEDROOM - ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT

Jeanne draws her sword with a terrifying scrape as though
about to kill someone, slices something in f.g. -- and a
chunk of black hair falls to the ground.

		JEANNE
	So what if I'm a girl...?
		   (cuts another chunk)
	You need to look like a man to drive
	out the English?
		   (and another)
	Fine... let's look like a man!

Aulon grabs her by the wrist to take the sword from her --

		AULON
	Jeanne, stop it!

		JEANNE
	How dare you stop me doing God's
	will!

Aulon wrestles to get the sword from her --

		AULON
	He didn't tell you to cut all your
	hair off...!

		JEANNE
	How dare you tell me what God tells
	me to do!

		AULON
	Alright, whatever -- but since He's
	not going to come down and cut it
	himself, at least let someone cut it
	properly!

He finally manages to grab the sword from her...

		AULON
	Raymond -- bring me scissors!
	Louis -- fetch that mirror!

The two page boys hop to it, but when Louis brings the
mirror, Jeanne slaps it from his hand...

		AULON
	Jeanne, stop getting so angry about
	everything...!  Calm down!

Jeanne stares at him.

		JEANNE
	I am calm.  It's God who's angry.  I
	need to send a letter.  Now.

Aulon looks at her.


INT.  HQ - ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT

Dunois reads the parchment that Aulon hands to him...

		JEANNE (V.O.)
	To you, Henry King of England, and
	to you, Duke of Bedford who call
	yourself Regent of France, obey the
	King of Heaven and abandon your
	siege...

Dunois can scarcely believe it.  He hands it to Alencon...

		JEANNE (V.O.)
	... give back the keys to the other
	towns you have taken, and go back
	home to your island...

Equally bemused, Alencon hands it to La Hire...

		JEANNE (V.O.)
	To you Lord Talbot, I beg you as
	humbly as I can beg you, for the
	sake of the lives of your soldiers,
	do not bring about your own
	destruction...

La Hire whistles with admiration and hands it to Gilles.

		JEANNE (V.O.)
	Surrender to me, Jeanne the Maiden,
	who is sent here by God, and she
	will make peace with you...

Gilles grins, and hands back to Aulon, who looks to Dunois
for an answer.  Dunois gives a vague nod of the head...


EXT.  BROKEN BRIDGE - ORLEANS - NIGHT

As Jeanne's letter continues, Aulon walks across the
broken stone bridge that once connected the city to the
south bank of the Loire.  Two-thirds the way across, the
bridge ends abruptly, leaving a yawning gap between us and
the fortress of the Tourelles.

		JEANNE (V.O.)
	... but if you do not heed my
	warning, then we shall raise such a
	battle-cry as there has not been
	heard in France for a thousand
	years!

Aulon takes the arrow to which Jeanne's letter is already
tied, places it in the bow -- takes aim and fires...


EXT.  TOURELLES - ROOF/COURTYARD - NIGHT

The arrow lands in wooden planking.  An English soldier
with a flaming red beard yanks it out, gives it a cursory
glance, grins, then clambers down to the courtyard below
where soldiers are busily trimming the branches from
freshly-felled trees.  Redbeard hands the letter to an
English captain, Glasdale...

		JEANNE (V.O.)
	This is the third and last time I
	will write to you...

Glasdale reads it, and gives his response.


EXT.  BROKEN BRIDGE - ORLEANS - NIGHT

Aulon is still waiting at the end of the broken bridge.

		JEANNE (V.O.)
	If you are still here at noon, I
	warn you that you will hear from me
	to your very great destruction.
	Please give me your answer speedily.

Redbeard yells out from the top of the Tourelles...

		REDBEARD
	Go fuck yourself!


INT.  JEANNE'S BEDROOM - ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT

Aulon hesitates, then softly opens the door.  He tiptoes
into the room, looks at Jeanne, then at Louis, who has
fallen asleep with the scissors still clasped somewhat
dangerously to his chest.  Aulon gently removes them.  As
he places them on the table, Jeanne murmurs in her sleep,
but without opening her eyes.

		JEANNE
	What did they say?

		AULON
	Uh... they said... they will think
	about it.

		JEANNE
	Good.

		AULON
	But... to be honest... I don't think
	they'll leave tomorrow.

Jeanne is almost asleep again...

		JEANNE
	I can't wait... for tomorrow...

Aulon sits in a chair nearby, gazing at Jeanne, who now
looks even younger, with her hair shorn short like a boy.


EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - ST. LOUP - DAWN

SMASH CUT into the fury of battle -- swords hacking
through armor, whirling maces smashing visors, blood
spurting from severed limbs... Among the combatants:
Dunois, Alencon, La Hire and Gilles...


INT.  JEANNE'S BEDROOM - ORLEANS HOUSE - DAWN

Jeanne suddenly sits bolt upright, eyes wide.  Aulon is
still asleep in his chair where we last saw him.

		JEANNE
	French blood is spilling!

Aulon awakes as she leaps to her feet, strapping on her
breast plate and gauntlets...

		AULON
	What's going on?!

		JEANNE
	They've started the battle without
	me!

She tips the two page boys onto the floor...

		JEANNE
	Oh, my boys -- why didn't you wake
	me up?!  Come on, hurry up --
	Raymond, saddle my horse -- there's
	a battle to fight and a war to be
	won!

Raymond runs off and Aulon takes his place, helping Louis
to buckle on Jeanne's armor.  She rushes off, leaving
Louis to assist Aulon with his own armor...


EXT.  HOUSE &amp; STREET - ORLEANS - DAWN

Jeanne runs out of the house to where Raymond is standing
with her horse.  She mounts it and canters off...


INT.  JEANNE'S BEDROOM - ORLEANS - DAWN

Still buckling on his own armor, Aulon spots Jeanne's
furled white banner leaning against the wall...


EXT.  HOUSE &amp; STREET - ORLEANS - DAWN

Jeanne suddenly remembers she's forgotten her banner.  She
turns her horse about and canters back, screaming out --

		JEANNE
	My banner!  I forgot my banner!

Aulon appears at the window, holding her banner --

		AULON
	Jeanne... here!

Jeanne circles about and canters forward...

		JEANNE
	Throw it!

Aulon throws it down to her.  She catches it with one
hand, turns and gallops off down the street, the white
banner streaming out behind her.


EXT.  EAST GATE - ORLEANS - DAWN

The Guard above the main gate sees the French army
approaching in full retreat.  He calls down...

		GUARD
	Open the gates!


EXT.  STREETS - ORLEANS - DAWN

Sparks fly as the hooves of Jeanne's horse strike the
flint cobblestones, swift and clean...


EXT.  ST. LOUP VALLEY - ORLEANS - DAWN

... unlike the hundreds of hooves pounding through mud and
mire in the opposite direction.


EXT.  EAST GATE - ORLEANS - DAWN

Jeanne reaches the gates as they are swung open, and the
first of the retreating troops make it back to the city --
among them, La Hire and Gilles de Rais...

		JEANNE
	What happened?  Who gave the order
	to attack?

		LA HIRE
	God knows, but it was a bad idea!

		JEANNE
		   (to Gilles)
	Were the men confessed?  Where are
	the priests?

		GILLES
		   (out of breath)
	We didn't take them... we wanted to
	be fast... wanted to make a surprise
	attack...

Dunois rides up and Jeanne assails him --

		JEANNE
	Dunois... was it you who ordered the
	attack?  Answer me?!

		DUNOIS
	Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?

		JEANNE
	Sooner is better than later!

Jeanne charges forward, into the confused ranks of
retreating French soldiers.  Dunois thinks she's gone
crazy --

		DUNOIS
	Come back... you'll be killed!

But Jeanne's not listening.  She's been waiting long
enough for this moment, and now she has it, there's no
going back.  She stands in her stirrups and shouts out --

		JEANNE
	Follow me and I will give you
	victory!

La Hire is the first to change his mind, riding up behind
Jeanne like Attila the Hun as she gallops forward into the
path of the retreating French.  Now the Duke of Alencon
joins them, and soon the whole army has turned about -- an
immense tidal wave of energy rolling back across the
valley...


EXT.  ST. LOUP FORTIFICATIONS - ORLEANS - DAY

... toward the astonished English.  One moment they were
pursuing their hapless enemies, but now an avenging angel
bears down on them, sunlight glinting off her armor.  They
start racing back toward their own fortifications:  the
bastille St. Loup -- a great fortress amid a network of
trenches and tunnels...

The French army is finally behaving as a single organism
whereas the English cohesion fragments into shards of
individual panic -- every man for himself!  They regard
Jeanne as a sorceress, and terror spreads like cancer
among their ranks.  They turn and flee back to their own
lines, only to be bombarded by a fusillade of their own
missiles, poorly aimed at the French.

Soon the St. Loup tower is ablaze, the English are forced
to abandon their fortress... and the French finally get to
celebrate their first victory within living memory.

Jeanne has become an object of worship and veneration, and
the soldiers crowd about her, cheering her as their
savior.  Presently Dunois rides up with his Captains...

		DUNOIS
	It's a great victory, Jeanne... your
	victory.  But we must follow it
	through and pursue the English back
	to Talbot's camp... unless of course
	you have another good idea?

Jeanne closes her eyes a moment... then smiles at Dunois.

		JEANNE
	We return to Orleans... across the
	bridge, at the Tourelles.

		GILLES
	But the bridge has been pulled down!

		JEANNE
	The English are rebuilding it.

		DUNOIS
	How do you know?!

FLASH:  Jeanne and her army are silently moving through a
forest.  From her POV, she notices hundreds of fresh
trees-stumps...

		JEANNE
	You have been with your counsel, and
	I have been with mine.


EXT.  TOURELLES COMPLEX - ORLEANS - DAY

The English are moving up the stripped trees we saw
earlier from the Tourelles courtyard toward the broken
bridge.  Glasdale surveys the operation with satisfaction.


EXT.  TOURELLES - POV FROM ROOF - DAY

Redbeard and the other English Guards on the roof of the
Tourelles spot Jeanne's army in the far distance.
Redbeard calls down to Glasdale...

		REDBEARD
	Glasdale!  Looks like the froggie
	whore's coming to pay you a visit.


EXT.  MONASTERY - ORLEANS - DAY

Jeanne rides at the head of the army, flanked by Dunois,
La Hire, Alencon, Gilles, Aulon, Xaintrailles.  They halt
in front of a ruined monastery to the south of the
Tourelles.  Jeanne gives instructions for the placement of
artillery...

		JEANNE
	Position the long-bows over there,
	crossbows over there -- and set up
	Dijon Culverins either side of those
	trees...

		DUNOIS
	The wind will be against us...

		JEANNE
	The wind will be with us!
		   (to the Captains)
	Do as I say.


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

The English take up their positions along the ramparts of
the battery -- a massive, square fortification, surrounded
by a deep, empty moat.

Jeanne rides forward to the edge of the dry moat, her
banner billowing in the breeze, and addresses the
English...

		JEANNE
	Glasdale, can you hear me?  You who
	call me a whore, I pity your soul
	and the souls of your men.  Yield
	now to the King of Heaven, and go
	back to your island...

		GLASDALE
	And you, go back to Hell!

Jeanne turns and gallops back to the French soldiers as
Glasdale turns coolly to Redbeard --

		GLASDALE
	Don't kill her till I've had my fill
	of her!

-- and walks back to the Tourelles.

The French have established a temporary headquarters.
Dunois is drawing a map in the dirt and is preparing a
battle plan with his Captains...

		DUNOIS
	Let's plan this attack a little more
	carefully than this morning...

		GILLES
	Good idea!

		JEANNE (O.S.)
		   (calling)
	My fine soldiers...!

Dunois turns to see Jeanne, standing before the army...

		JEANNE
	This morning, God gave us our first
	victory, but that was nothing
	compared to what he is ready to give
	us now.  I know you are tired and
	hungry, but I swear to you in the
	name of the King of Heaven that even
	if these English were hanging from
	the clouds by their fingertips, we
	shall tear them down before
	nightfall...!  Now, my brave
	soldiers... let those who love me
	follow me!

With a valiant cry, a thousand soldiers tear forward
behind Jeanne.  Dunois is speechless.  Gilles lays a
sympathetic hand on his shoulder.

		GILLES
	You were saying?

Jeanne rides at full tilt down into the dry moat, and for
the next few minutes, the air is thick with the tumult of
battle.  As each successive wave swarms across the moat,
so they are met by a fusillade of English flame and steel
from the battery above.  But the French respond with equal
fervor:  the Dijon Culverins deployed by Jeanne now rain
an aerial bombardment of boulders down upon the English,
while their arrows darken the sky above...

Jeanne reaches the base of the battery.  She leaps down
from her horse and starts to climb one of the ladders
being thrown up against the wall... but is suddenly struck
by an arrow from the rampart above.  She reels -- the
ladder sways -- and Aulon catches her in his arms as she
falls back to earth.  Redbeard is jokingly furious --

		REDBEARD
	Hey, you just killed my woman!

The English laugh and jeer, but the French are in dismay
at the sight of their Jeanne, unconscious, lying in
Aulon's arms, with the arrow wedged deep above her breast.


EXT.  MONASTERY BEHIND TOURELLES - DAY

Aulon, La Hire and Xaintrailles carry her to the ruined
monastery while the two page boys follow anxiously behind.


INT.  ST. AUGUSTINE MONASTERY - DAY

They enter the shell-shattered sanctuary of a gothic
chapel where Aulon directs them to lay Jeanne against the
wall.  In the distance we can hear the muffled sounds of
war, but in here it is strangely quiet.

The great war-lords stand in a semi-circle, pathetically
wringing their hands, like the seven dwarves bereaving the
stricken Snow White.  The sight of tears trickling down La
Hire's scarred cheeks is as touching as it is pathetic.
Aulon wipes her brow, leaning in very close to feel her
pulse and whether her mouth exhales breath.  He turns to
Raymond, who stands close by with Louis --

		AULON
	Go and find the physician... I saw
	him with the supplies.

Raymond races off...

		GILLES
	We have to take out the arrow now.

		AULON
	It's in so deep -- I'm afraid she'll
	bleed to death if we pull it out...

		LA HIRE
	There must be something we can do
	for her for Chrissakes!

		GILLES
		   (sarcastic)
	Yes.  We can pray.

		LA HIRE
	Good idea...

La Hire turns and directs his pledge to the broken
stained-glass image of Christ above the trashed altar...

		LA HIRE
	I swear I'll never swear again in my
	life if you save her life!  But I'm
	warning you, if you let her die,
	then you're the biggest...

		JEANNE
	Don't swear...

Jeanne stirs, her eyes beginning to open...

		LA HIRE
	He heard me!

		AULON
	Jeanne... we thought we'd lost you!

		JEANNE
	Not so... easily.  Why aren't you...
	fighting...?  go on... we're almost
	there...

		AULON
	Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...

		JEANNE
	No, it's... it's nothing, it's...

Speaking provokes a sudden stab of pain.  She tries to
clutch the arrow, but Aulon stops her.  He peels back her
shirt, exposing the bloody wound above her pale breast.

		GILLES
	It's an arrow, and it's in deep...

		AULON
	You must stay still till the
	physician arrives!

		LA HIRE
	Physicians are a waste of time.
	You'll have more luck with this
	charm of mine... it saved my life at
	Agincourt!

		JEANNE
	I'd sooner die than use magic!

		AULON
	Jeanne, you will die if that arrow
	stays in you much longer...

Jeanne suddenly seizes the arrow and yanks it out of her
body.  Blood spurts -- the suddenness and violence of her
action catches the men unaware, and it's a moment before
Aulon can stem the flow with his hand.  Jeanne looks at
the arrow before throwing it aside...

		JEANNE
	At least this one won't bother us
	any more.  Now let's get back to the
	fight!

She tries to get up... and collapses, grabbing Aulon...

		AULON
	Jeanne... please... you must stay
	calm... you must rest... please!

He lays her back down.  Jeanne whispers to him,
intimately.

		JEANNE
	Alright... I promise to rest if you
	promise... to go back to the battle.

		AULON
	I promise...

Jeanne smiles -- then suddenly collapses...

		LA HIRE
	Oh shit!  Jeanne... don't die!

La Hire breaks off as Raymond arrives back with the
Physician...

		AULON
	Quickly... do something!

The Physician kneels beside her and listens for any sound
of life.  All the Captains crowd closer and closer, and as
we too move closer, we hear the sound of deep breathing,
almost a snore.

		PHYSICIAN
	She's sleeping.  Like a baby.

La Hire and the others sigh with relief.


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DUSK

Dunois surveys his army's attempt to storm the English
battery.  It is now dusk, and without Jeanne the battle
has become a half-hearted affair.  He turns to a trumpeter
as Aulon comes running up...

		AULON
	Jeanne's alive!

		DUNOIS
	Good.

		AULON
	We have to press home the attack!

		DUNOIS
		   (to the Trumpeter)
	Sound the retreat...

		AULON
	But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!

		DUNOIS
	I made no such promise.  Sound the
	retreat for the night!

		AULON
	But that was her order!

		DUNOIS
	I'm fed up with taking her orders.
	She swore she'd defeat the English
	before nightfall, instead of which
	she goes and plays the fool and gets
	herself nearly killed!  Look at the
	mess we're in!  That's her mess, not
	mine...!  We're worse off then if
	she'd never come at all!
		   (to the Trumpeter)
	... now do as I say and Sound the
	Retreat!

The Trumpeter obeys and signals the evening wrap.  The
English jeer and whistle from their impregnable battery as
the French head back up the sloping sides of the moat.


INT.  ST. AUGUSTINE MONASTERY - DUSK

Jeanne lies asleep inside the ruined church, guarded by
her two page boys.  A small fire burns nearby to keep her
warm, but she is shivering...


EXT.  ORLEANS - JEANNE'S NIGHTMARE - NIGHT

She suddenly awakes with a start, then gets up and goes to
the fire.  She kneels down... puts her hands in the
flames... and scoops up a handful of ash.  She paints her
face with the black ash, like a native warrior, then
stands back up, turning to face a small army...

		JEANNE
	My brave soldiers, do you believe in
	God?

The Army cries out "Yeesssss!"

		JEANNE
	Then let God's punishment be done:
	Eye for eye...

... and a sudden FLASH of lightning transforms some of her
men into skeletons...

		JEANNE
	... tooth for tooth...!
		   (another flash)
	... burn for burn...!
		   (another flash)
	... life for a life!

... a final FLASH, and her whole army is now a seething
swarm of SKELETONS.  With a curdling cry of vengeance they
race forward, passing either side of her...

Jeanne turns to see the skeleton army heading across a
bizarre bridge and onto the moonlit battery, flowing
either side of the 8 year-old BOY she saw in the woods as
a child.  Intrigued, Jeanne follows him, but by the time
she reaches him, the boy has disappeared.  The skeletons
have also vanished, to be replaced by an army of little
English boys in man-sized armor, heading toward a distant
figure.

The boy-soldiers are being welcomed by the beautiful MAN
Jeanne saw earlier.  He smiles at her, extending his arms
in a Christ-like gesture of embrace...

As Jeanne approaches him, others turn to welcome her --
Aulon, Dunois, Alencon... finally La Hire, holding out his
arms --

		LA HIRE
	Jeanne, come here my friend, my
	soldier... in my arms!

La Hire scoops her up into his bear-like arms and swings
her round... suddenly, over his shoulder she spots a
familiar figure:  her dead sister.

		JEANNE
	Catherine??

She breaks from La Hire and runs to Catherine, throwing
her arms around her and sobbing with joy...

		JEANNE
	Catherine... oh, Catherine -- I knew
	you wouldn't leave me...!

They stand for a moment, embracing each other, while La
Hire and the other Captains applaud Jeanne's victory.  The
beautiful young MAN approaches them, but we now see that
he has a sword clasped behind his back...

Catherine's face contorts in pain.  She slumps forward,
the sword in her back.  Beyond her, the beautiful MAN has
transformed into the grotesque Blackbeard, who roars with
laughter as Jeanne holds her dying sister...

		CATHERINE
	Avenge me... avenge me...!

A circle of fire forms around them, with skeleton soldiers
dancing in the flames...

Blackbeard's echoing laugh is gradually superimposed by
real laughter and a familiar voice...

		REDBEARD (O.S.)
	Hey... Frenchies... what happened to
	your precious angel, huh?


EXT.  TOURELLES - FRENCH CAMP - DAWN

All is quiet, the troops lie sleeping.  Redbeard calls
through the mist from the raised drawbridge spanning the
dry moat linking the battery to the French camp --

		REDBEARD
	Frenchies, you hear me?  What
	happened to your little virgin?

Jeanne is awake.  She listens to Redbeard...

		REDBEARD
	I'll tell you what happened... we
	sent her back to Hell so she can go
	fuck with the Devil!

Now Jeanne is caressing her horse while Redbeard taunts...

		REDBEARD
	What are you going to do, Frenchies?
	Why not come out and fight?  Or are
	you too busy praying to bring your
	witch back from the dead?  Do you
	hear me?

Suddenly Jeanne emerges from the mist, riding her horse
and brandishing her banner --

		JEANNE
	I hear you!  May God forgive your
	blasphemy... but I never can!

She turns and disappears back into the mist.


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAWN

Redbeard blinks in amazement.  He turns to another
soldier --

		REDBEARD
	Go and wake up Glasdale...!


EXT.  TOURELLES - FRENCH CAMP - DAWN

Jeanne rides along the columns of sleeping soldiers...

		JEANNE
	Come on -- wake up -- sound trumpets
	and to horse!

The dazed and sleepy French drag themselves from their
straw beds.  Dunois emerges from his tent, bleary and
half-naked...

		DUNOIS
	What's going on?

		JEANNE
	We're taking back the Tourelles!


INT.  TOURELLES - TURRET ROOM - DAWN

The Guard shakes Glasdale awake...

		GLASDALE
	What's happening?

		GUARD
	My lord... the French witch just
	came back from the dead.

Glasdale hauls himself from his bed.


EXT.  TOURELLES - FRENCH CAMP - DAWN

Jeanne supervises her men as they push a huge siege tower
toward the dry moat.  She rides over to Aulon...

		JEANNE
	Get all the men to horse and ready
	to follow...

Aulon goes as Dunois hurries over...

		DUNOIS
	Jeanne, what are you doing with
	that... you've got it back to
	front...

		JEANNE
	I know what I'm doing, so either
	lend a hand or go back to bed!


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAWN

Redbeard watches in bewilderment as the siege machine
starts to materialize through the mist...

		REDBEARD
	What the hell she's playing at...?


EXT.  TOURELLES - TURRET - DAWN

Glasdale is equally perplexed, gazing out from his garret
window across the battery.  An archer is by his side.

		GLASDALE
	Crazy bitch... she doesn't even know
	how to use it...


EXT.  TOURELLES - DRY MOAT/BATTERY - DAWN

The French wheel the enormous siege tower toward a wooden
lip above the dry moat.  The drawbridge is firmly raised
on the far side.  Redbeard's complacent expression changes
as he suddenly realizes what's about to happen...

		REDBEARD
	Oh shit...

He backs away as the machine reaches the lip.  Suddenly it
topples forward, crashing down on top of the raised
drawbridge and demolishing it beneath its enormous
weight...


EXT.  TOURELLES - TURRET - DAWN

From his elevated viewpoint, Glasdale watches in horror as
Aulon leads the French cavalry across the siege machine
bridge that now spans the dry moat, giving them access to
the battery...

		GLASDALE
	Raise the drawbridge!

The Archer passes Glasdale's order along -- a chain
message that reaches the gate-keeper, who promptly starts
to turn the winch...


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

As the French swarm onto the battery, Redbeard and his
soldiers turn tail and race back toward the second
drawbridge into the Tourelles...

		REDBEARD
	Wait for me!

The bridge is already being winched up... Redbeard is the
first to reach it... with a desperate leap he manages to
grab the lip of the bridge and scramble over...


EXT.  TOURELLES - COURTYARD - DAY

... rolling down into the sanctuary of the Tourelles on
the far side.


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

His comrades are less fortunate, and are slaughtered by
the advancing French.

Jeanne urges her troops forward, her white banner
billowing in the breeze, but with the drawbridge raised,
there is no way for them to enter the Tourelles.  The
English hurl fresh insults -- and bombards -- from the
battlements above, and the French are forced to take cover
behind two ruined buildings on the battery.

Jeanne rides across to a ruined barn where several carts
are stacked with felled tree-trunks.  She spots La Hire...

		JEANNE
	Prepare these as battering-rams!

		LA HIRE
	What's the use?  The drawbridge is
	up!

		JEANNE
	Not for long...

Under a hail of English arrows, Jeanne rides back across
the open battery to a ruined house on the other side.  She
sees Aulon and dismounts...

		JEANNE
	The king said you're his finest
	archer...?

		AULON
	Well...

		JEANNE
	Come with me...


INT.  RUINED HOUSE - TOURELLES - DAY

Jeanne leads Aulon through the ruined house to the far
end, where a window overlooks the river-moat that
separates the battery from the Tourelles.

		JEANNE
	You see those wooden beams...?

Jeanne points to the two beams supporting the chains of
the drawbridge further along...

		JEANNE
	I want you to set them on fire!


INT.  TOURELLES - TURRET - DAY

Glasdale spots Jeanne running back across the battery.  He
summons his Archer, pointing her out...

		GLASDALE
	Kill her.


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

Jeanne leaves the ruined house and spots Gilles standing
with Alencon.  As she approaches, Gilles spots the archer
in Glasdale's window far above, taking aim.

		JEANNE
	Gilles -- fetch the Dijon Culverins
	and place them over there...

Jeanne turns her back -- the Archer fires -- Gilles holds
up his shield -- the arrow strikes it -- and Jeanne turns
back, unaware that he has just saved her life.

		JEANNE
	Clear?

		GILLES
	Perfectly.

Gilles heads off, leaving Alencon looking left out.

		ALENCON
	And me... what can I do?

		JEANNE
	Um... round up the horses and keep
	them safe...

		ALENCON
	Good idea.

Leaving Alencon to his task, Jeanne rides off...

... and THUMP!  a flaming arrow lands in one of the
drawbridge beams.


EXT.  TOURELLES - COMPLEX - DAY

An English soldier peers down to see both beams ablaze...

		SOLDIER
	Fetch some water!

The command is passed down the line -- a bucket is lowered
into the river and hauled back up -- the bucket rushed up
stone stairs to the soldier on the battlements...


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

Meanwhile Jeanne returns to Dunois and La Hire --

		JEANNE
	Stand by with the battering-rams...

		DUNOIS
	We need another ten minutes...

		JEANNE
	The bridge won't wait!

		LA HIRE
	Leave it to me...

Back on the battlements, the bucket of water is passed up
to the Soldier, who tries to pour it over the edge and
onto the blazing beam.  Aulon spots him from below and
fires a flaming arrow -- it pierces the soldier, who pours
the water on himself, extinguishing the flames...


EXT.  TOURELLES - COMPLEX - DAY

TIGHT SHOTS:  hands wind the handle of a bobbin -- a
device is activated -- a lever thrown -- a grille slides
sideways...


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

The beams collapse -- the support chains give way -- and
the drawbridge comes crashing down.  Beyond it is a
portcullis, but to La Hire's exuberant volunteers this is
no barrier.  Carrying buckets of flaming oil, they charge
forward...

... but as they race across the drawbridge, a sudden
volley of high-velocity arrows discharge from the lower
apertures of the portcullis, felling them before they even
get halfway across the bridge.


EXT.  TOURELLES - COMPLEX - DAY

The English cackle with delight at the sight of the dying
French writhing in the flaming oil.  Redbeard -- in charge
of the multiple balista -- orders the device to be
reloaded, then yells through the upper portcullis...

		REDBEARD
	Hey, what happened to the whore?
	Sorry... virgin!


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

Dunois views the massacred soldiers lying on the bridge
amid the dying flames.  Jeanne is about to mount her
horse...

		REDBEARD
	Send her over here and she won't
	stay a virgin for long!

		DUNOIS
	Jeanne, don't do it!  Just stop and
	think for once!  Don't you see?  The
	gate's a trap... and he's the bait!

Redbeard roars with laughter as Jeanne yells back --

		JEANNE
	I take pity on your soul,
	Englishman!


EXT.  TOURELLES - COMPLEX - DAY

Redbeard checks the reloading of the balista...

		REDBEARD
	What the matter?  Frightened of a
	little English stuffing?


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

Jeanne gently puts her arm around her horse's neck,
whispering to it...

		JEANNE
	We must both be brave...

She kisses it lightly, then grabs her banner from Louis,
calling out to the others --

		JEANNE
	When you see my banner touch the
	door, the fortress is ours!

... and away she rides, across the drawbridge, still piled
with the slaughtered men from the first attack.

		REDBEARD
	... and... fire!!

Another volley of arrows discharges from the portcullis
and Jeanne's horse collapses.  The English cheer...


INT.  TOURELLES - TURRET - DAY

From his garret window high above, Glasdale sees Jeanne
spread-eagled next to her dead horse on the drawbridge
below.  He turns to his servant with a grin...

		GLASDALE
	This time she won't be back.


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

Aulon gapes in horror... but then suddenly Jeanne is back
up on her feet again.  Gripping her banner, she dashes
forward toward the portcullis, implanting it just as
Redbeard opens a little sliding grille -- Jeanne jabs her
banner through --


EXT.  TOURELLES - COMPLEX - DAY

... impaling Redbeard's skull on the far side!  His body
crumples to the ground, wedged between the base of the
portcullis and the balista.


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

Jeanne runs back across the drawbridge, crying out...

		JEANNE
	The place is ours!


EXT.  TOURELLES - COMPLEX - DAY

Inside the Tourelles, the English try to operate the
reloaded balista.  But Redbeard's corpse is wedged so
tightly that they can't move it...


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

Jeanne moves aside as La Hire and his men heave the carts
laden with tree-trunk battering-rams across the bridge...


INT.  TOURELLES - TURRET - DAY

Glasdale has seen enough...


INT.  TOURELLES - DAY

... He tears down into the courtyard, mustering soldiers
as he goes --

		GLASDALE
	To arms!  To arms!

With a triumphant battle-cry, the French charge their
battering-ram into the portcullis...


EXT.  TOURELLES - COMPLEX - DAY

... demolishing it like matchwood, then storm inside the
fortress.  Glasdale cries out to his troops --

		GLASDALE
	Soldiers... In the name of the king,
	I want you to kill these French dogs
	until there's none left!

The English troops swarm either side of the broken
portcullis, forcing most of the French back onto the
battery...


EXT.  TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

La Hire lets out a blood-curdling, primeval war-cry and
charges forward to meet the English wave head on.  Jeanne
is caught in the middle, buffeted from side to side by a
sea of heaving, sweating, bleeding bodies...

In this melee it is impossible to know who is friend or
foe, and the images become so blurred that we and Jeanne
are soon lost in a mist of dust and noise...


EXT.  TOURELLES - DREAM - DAY

FLASH:  our eyes are momentarily blinded by the sun... and
when we return, we find Jeanne in the middle of the
battery, but now totally alone, weaving her sword through
the air in SLOW MOTION as she once did with her stick...


EXT.  FIELD - DREAM - DAY/NIGHT

FLASH:  Jeanne is still weaving the air with her sword,
but she is now a little girl of eight, playing in the
field we first saw her in.  The small BOY looks at her,
smiling...

FLASH:  Jeanne continues to play, but is now 17, and the
boy is now a young MAN, still smiling.  He calls out to
her.

		MAN
	Jeanne... what are you doing?

		JEANNE
	Playing...

She sweeps her sword and decapitates a flower.  Blood
flows from the stalk... Jeanne looks at it, more in
childish curiosity than astonishment or horror.  She
looks at the sword, the blade now streaked with blood...

		MAN
	Jeanne... what are you doing?

Jeanne pauses, looks at him steadily... and suddenly
notices that blood is trickling down his face.  A SHAFT OF
LIGHT blazes, wind billows... and suddenly it's winter,
the trees naked, heavy with snow...

		MAN
	What have you done to me, Jeanne?

Jeanne looks horrified.  The Man puts his hands to her
face, gazing deep into her eyes...

		MAN
	What have you done to me?

		JEANNE
	I -- I -- I...


EXT.  TOURELLES - COURTYARD - DAY

Jeanne is screaming at Aulon, who is gripping her blood-
splattered face as the Man did...

		AULON
	Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me?
	Are you alright?

		JEANNE
	Yes...

		AULON
	It's over, Jeanne.  We won, just as
	you said!

Jeanne looks about her in a daze.  La Hire strides over,
arms extended, extravagant as always --

		LA HIRE
	Jeanne, come here my friend, my
	soldier... in my arms!

Jeanne starts laughing -- she can't believe it...

		JEANNE
	We... won?!

		LA HIRE
	Won?!  Such a small word will never
	do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this
	is... glory!

He scoops her up in his bear-like arms like an ebullient
lover, both laughing in the moment.  He slowly turns her
around, breathing in a great lungful of air and savoring
the smell of what Jeanne now sees over his shoulder:  the
entire courtyard, knee-deep in bodies and bits of bodies
-- including the gallant Xaintrailles.

Jeanne too can smell the reek of fresh, warm gore.  Her
laugh turns to a cry of anguish.  La Hire sets her back
down...

		LA HIRE
	Jeanne -- what's the matter??

Jeanne is utterly horrified... her legs tremble... amber
liquid trickles down her armor...

		JEANNE
	You call this... glory...?  All
	this... this blood... this smell
	of...

		LA HIRE
	... the smell of victory, Jeanne!
	Mmmmmmm!  I love it!

		JEANNE
	It's not possible...

Jeanne sees a French soldier of meager wit, hauling a
dying English soldier onto his knees for some obscure
purpose.

		GILLES
	You look disappointed... Isn't this
	what you wanted?

		JEANNE
	No... not like this...

		GILLES
	For weeks you've been asking for
	this... well now you have it!

The Soldier is about to smash the Englishman's mouth with
a mace.  Jeanne snaps out of her momentary stupor and
races across, stumbling over the dead bodies...

		JEANNE
	Stop it!  What are you doing?

		SOLDIER
	Nothing... just taking his teeth.

		JEANNE
	But you can't just kill a man for
	his teeth!

		SOLDIER
	Why not?  He has good teeth...

		JEANNE
	Because... because you just can't!

		GILLES
	Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth...

Jeanne ignores the laconic Gilles...

		SOLDIER
	Besides, what about these...?

		JEANNE
	That's different... I mean... we
	were fighting for a... for a cause!

Gilles grins, but La Hire looks genuinely bemused at
Jeanne's behavior.  The soldier shrugs, unimpressed.

		SOLDIER
	Not me.  He's my prisoner... I can
	take his teeth if I want to...

He is about to smash the teeth...

		JEANNE
	No!

She throws herself in front of the startled Frenchman.

		JEANNE
	Take mine instead -- here -- smash
	mine first!

		LA HIRE
	Jeanne... get up... this is
	ridiculous...

		JEANNE
	If you kill him, you kill me!

		GILLES
	Jeanne... let him do it.  One more
	dead body's not going to make any
	difference, so who cares?

		JEANNE
	I care!  And I care because God
	cares!  All life is precious to God
	-- even his -- even yours and
	mine...

		LA HIRE
	Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid
	for six months -- that's his only
	reward.  Let him take a few teeth...

		JEANNE
	A few teeth... that's the price of
	his life?

		SOLDIER
	Yeah...

		JEANNE
	Here -- take this instead.

She wrenches a ring from her finger and flings it at the
soldier.

		JEANNE
	He's mine now.

Jeanne cuts the Englishman's bonds...

		JEANNE
	Now you... get out.

The English soldier doesn't wait for further prompting.
Gilles claps...

		GILLES
	Bravo!  What about all the other
	hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let
	them go too?

		JEANNE
	Maybe... I don't know... but first
	we have to confess...


INT.  AUGUSTINE MONASTERY - DAY

Jeanne marches her blood-splattered captains into the
church and up the aisle toward the rubble-strewn altar.
She sees a terrified Franciscan PRIEST and grabs hold of
him...

		JEANNE
	Please... we have to be confessed...
	all of us... now!  I know it's not
	normal custom, but sometimes... you
	know... we have to make an exception
	and... and today is an exception...

The Priest looks confounded.  Jeanne turns to the
Captains.

		JEANNE
	He's going to confess us.  Kneel!

All but La Hire kneel, although their armor is stiff at
the joints.

		LA HIRE
	Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll
	stay standing... this armor... it's
	a nightmare to get back up...

		JEANNE
	I said, kneel!

Jeanne raises her sword and brings the flat blade whacking
against the back of his legs.  La Hire crumples, and
Jeanne turns to the Priest...

		JEANNE
	Please... we're ready... begin!

The Priest is totally lost... he begins to mumble a few
words in Latin just as a soldier burst in --

		SOLDIER
		   (breathless)
	The English... they're forming up...
	thousands of them... on the far side
	of the river...

The Captains look anxiously at Jeanne.  She hesitates a
moment, then gazes up at the battered crucifix on the
altar and closes her eyes in prayer...


EXT.  NORTH PLATEAU - ORLEANS - DAWN

Jeanne opens her eyes.  It is dawn, and two silent armies
are drawn up facing one another:  four thousand Englishmen
on the left, two thousand Frenchmen on the right.  They
have barely had time to recover from the Tourelles, and
the lust for battle is gone.  We sense that this is going
to be a blood bath that nobody wants.

Franciscan monks move among them, sprinkling them with
holy water in final absolution.  The battle lines are too
far apart for the English to see any details, but the
sight of massed soldiers kneeling before an invisible God
is an awesome spectacle.

Jeanne and the Captains are mounted, facing the English.

		DUNOIS
	Well...?  Shall we go?

		JEANNE
	Not yet.

		DUNOIS
	The English won't wait.

Jeanne hesitates...

		JEANNE
	I'll go.

		AULON
	Jeanne, no...

But Dunois silences him, indicating to Gilles that he
should accompany her.

		JEANNE
	Alone.

Dunois is again obliged to comply, and Gilles hangs back.

From the English lines, we see a small, solitary figure
emerge from the massed ranks of French soldiers.

Jeanne moves halfway between the two armies.  The English
soldiers watch her, mesmerized, while their captains
remain motionless.

In the middle of the field, Jeanne halts.  From the French
POV she looks dangerously vulnerable.  The English
commander -- TALBOT -- draws up alongside his Captains,
watching her with grey eyes and an expression of stone.
Only we see that Jeanne is crying.  She rubs the tears
away.

		JEANNE
	I have a message for your King
	Henry.  It is a message from God.

The English stand silent.

		JEANNE
	Go home... Go now, in peace.  If you
	don't go now, you will be buried in
	this field.  I've seen enough blood
	for today, but if you want more, I
	can't stop you.  I can only warn you
	that it will be your blood, not
	ours.

Talbot whispers something to one of his Captains.  He
withdraws to pass the message on.  Jeanne -- and her
French captains -- try to gauge the English mood.

		JEANNE
	I'm waiting for your answer.

Now the English Captains start moving along their flanks.
Something's about to happen.  Dunois and the French watch
in dismay as the English flanks move aside, exposing their
dreaded archers.  Jeanne closes her eyes, tears brimming.

		JEANNE
	Please, Lord... don't... don't let
	this happen... don't leave me...

The English archers take a step back, their cavalry move
slowly forward, then turn to their right, the men letting
them through.  Dunois turns to La Hire...

		DUNOIS
	Never wait for miracles.  Stand by
	to attack...

The serried ranks of English infantry close in, then halt.
We're ready for the worst, and it takes Jeanne -- and us
-- a full twenty seconds to realize what is happening:
the English are leaving.  First the cavalry, then the
infantry, finally the archers themselves.

Jeanne cannot believe her eyes.  She burst out laughing
and crying at the same time.  The French captains gape in
astonishment.  Finally La Hire can contain himself no
longer --

		LA HIRE
	By God and all the saints... now
	that's what I call a bloody miracle!

The French burst into jubilation...


INT.  CHINON CASTLE - DAY

As the cheering builds, we see a Messenger race along a
corridor and burst into the throne room.  Charles slowly
rises on hearing the joyous news, clapping his hands in
delight -- not least at the discomfort of Tremoille and
Regnault.  But Yolande shares his enthusiasm, although we
sense that the news comes as no great surprise.


INT.  ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

The cheering continues as another Messenger races along a
similar stone corridor and bursts in on the haggard Duke
of BEDFORD.  He is the English regent, and is in council
with several others, including the Bishop of Beauvais --
one Pierre CAUCHON.  As Bedford hears the news, the
cheering FADES.  He rises from his chair...

		BEDFORD
	I want that girl.  I want her
	burned.


EXT.  STREET - RHEIMS - DAY

The crowd goes wild as Jeanne rides through the streets of
Rheims, carrying her banner in triumph.  She is followed
by Aulon and her two page boys, and is accompanied by
soldiers who do their best to hold the ecstatic crowd at
bay.  At the far end of the street:  a magnificent
cathedral.


INT.  VESTRY - RHEIMS CATHEDRAL - DAY

Backstage pandemonium as Charles is readied for his
imminent coronation.  A glamorous Gilles tries to help him
into his ermine robe; Tremoille stands with Archbishop
Regnault, adjusting his gold-trimmed cloak.  An ancient
BISHOP -- palsied and pushing 80 -- stands by, hands
a-trembling.

		CHARLES
	It's too tight -- where's the
	seamstress?  And that...
		   (pointing to crown)
	... that's meant to be a crown?
	Don't you have something more --
	more regal?

A young Priest is holding the dowdy crown...

		PRIEST
	The English took the real one...

		CHARLES
	I asked for a grandiose coronation,
	and this is what you give me?  This
	whole thing's going to be a complete
	fiasco...!

		BISHOP
	Sire, we were only given three days
	to prepare -- three days! -- Why,
	your father's coronation took three
	months!

Charles turns to Tremoille --

		CHARLES
	He's probably right -- let's call a
	delay...

		TREMOILLE
	There's no time, sire -- we can't
	hold up the ceremony... there's no
	telling when the English might come
	back... they're only ten leagues
	away...

		CHARLES
	Let them come!  Let them see who's
	the true king of France!

Further away, Dunois is examining himself in a looking-
glass.  He is standing with Gilles de Rais, both
resplendent in their armor, now cleaned and polished...

		DUNOIS
	It's been muddy for so long, I
	forgot how good it looked when
	cleaned up...

		LA HIRE
	Did you remember to clean up what's
	inside as well?

Dunois ribs him with his elbow, both laughing.  In another
corner, Alencon is fast asleep.

Charles is still grumbling...

		CHARLES
	Those damn English... we should be
	doing this in Paris... in Notre Dame
	-- much more prestigious -- and
	twice as big as this one!

Yolande, who has been standing quietly in the shadows with
Richmond, steps forward...

		YOLANDE
	It is the sacred place that matters,
	Charles -- not the size.  Am I
	correct, Bishop?

		BISHOP
	Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of
	France must first be anointed in our
	great cathedral of Rheims... with
	the holy oil of Clovis... for it was
	within these very walls that Saint
	Remy received the sacred oil from
	Heaven, brought to him by a white
	dove for the anointing of King
	Clovis...

		TREMOILLE
	Yes, yes -- well let's just get on
	with it, shall we?

		GILLES
	... before the English turn up and
	spoil everything.

		CHARLES
	They wouldn't dare!

		GILLES
	I wouldn't be so sure.  It only
	takes one of them -- in disguise --

Gilles pulls a sharp dagger -- Charles looks petrified...

		GILLES
	... with a good dagger... that's all
	it takes...

Gilles lifts the dagger... and snips a loose thread from
Charles's shoulder...

		GILLES
	... to ruin the whole thing.

Gilles sheaths his dagger, but Charles is now panicking.
He glances at those around him as though one of them might
be a spy.  Gilles moves away, and Charles turns to his
pages --

		CHARLES
	Hurry up!

Further away, the Bishop's assistant Canon hurries in,
holding a small jar --

		CANON
	Your Grace, there can be no
	anointing!

		BISHOP
	What in heaven's name are you
	talking about?

		CANON
	The holy oil of Clovis -- it's all
	gone!

The ancient Archbishop can scarcely believe his ears.  He
peers inside the little jar just as Yolande arrives with
Richmond...

		BISHOP
	Gone??  But that's impossible --
	it's magic oil... I mean miraculous
	oil -- it can never be exhausted...

		CANON
	Look for yourself!

The Canon offers it to the Bishop, but Yolande
intervenes...

		YOLANDE
	Problem?

He hands her the little jar...

		BISHOP
	I don't understand... the holy oil
	of Clovis... it was quite full the
	last time I saw it...

		YOLANDE
	And when was that?

		BISHOP
	Well... at the coronation of King
	Charles VI...

		YOLANDE
	Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised
	it's gone...

		BISHOP
	No no, you don't understand -- this
	is no ordinary oil -- this is
	miraculous... this oil was brought
	from heaven by a white dove to crown
	King Clovis in this... very...
	cathedral...

Yolande has moved away, to be replaced by the hideously-
scarred Richmond.  The Bishop's voice trails as he sees
Yolande beyond him, taking an oil lamp from the wall and
pouring a little oil into the jar.

		BISHOP
	W-w-what are you doing?!

		YOLANDE
	Performing a miracle.

Richmond curtails any protest with a toothy grin.

There's a growing SOUND of excitement coming from beyond.
Finally Jeanne appears in the doorway, carrying her banner
and followed by her faithful page boys, Louis and Raymond.
La Hire nudges Alencon awake as she passes, giving an
admiring whistle.

		CHARLES
	Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This
	whole coronation idea of yours is a
	fiasco... nothing is ready...

		JEANNE
	... You look wonderful...

		CHARLES
	... and my crown doesn't fit and...
		   (breaking off)
	Really??

She looks up and down, appraising him...

		JEANNE
	You look like a king.

Charles melts.  TRUMPETS SOUND from the great Cathedral
beyond...


INT.  RHEIMS CATHEDRAL - DAY

Two tiers of boys sing in plainsong as Charles enters
through a small door and into the vastness of the crowded
Cathedral.  It is filled to capacity, with Jeanne's
comrades-in-arms filling the front pews like eager fans,
straining for a glimpse of her.

Tremoille waddles behind Charles, with Regnault, Yolande
and Richmond in tow.  Next, the two page boys -- and then
at last the main attraction as far as this congregation is
concerned -- the crowd lets out an audible gasp as Jeanne
enters in her white armor, carrying her proud, war-scarred
banner and escorted by Jean d'Aulon.

La Hire is so moved at the sight that he has to wipe away
big soppy tears (for sentimentality was ever the flip-side
of cruelty).  Alencon and Dunois likewise gaze at their
adored one, though Gilles is perhaps more taken with the
cherubic choir boys...

Jeanne trembles with emotion.  This is the peak of her
career, and she knows it, and she's making the most of it.
As the little procession reaches the nave, all but Charles
filter aside.  He walks forward alone to where Archbishop
Regnault is standing -- a few paces -- then stops, turns
-- and holds out his hands to Jeanne.

The crowd gasp with approval at the unprecedented
gesture... La Hire briefly claps, before being dug in the
ribs by Gilles... but the kingly act provokes jealous
looks from Regnault and Tremoille...

Jeanne hesitates, then is almost willed on by the crowd
into joining Charles.  She stands a little aside as he
kneels.  Regnault sprinkles the Holy Oil on his
sovereign's head...

		REGNAULT
	With this sacred oil, blessed by the
	hand of God the Father Almighty, we
	do anoint thee Charles Valois...

Regnault breaks off:  there's a commotion at the back of
the cathedral.  Charles looks around -- anxious faces turn
-- soldiers draw their swords -- is it the English??

Bored by the ceremony, young Louis has been kicking legs
again, and one of the guards is nursing a bruised shin.
With all eyes suddenly upon him, Louis flushes -- and is
quickly taken in hand by Yolande.  After the brief
interruption, Regnault continues...

		REGNAULT
	... we do anoint thee Charles
	Valois, Sovereign Lord and King of
	this great kingdom of France,
	charging that ye defend the faith of
	our Mother Holy Church so long as ye
	shall live...

It could almost be the marriage ceremony.  Jeanne watches
in tears, trembling with emotion as the Archbishop takes
the crown and holds it above Charles' head, then slowly,
slowly lowers it...

As he does so, an eerie SOUND, like a bullet in slow-
motion coming straight at us... followed by a cry from
Jeanne...


EXT.  PARIS WALLS - ST. DENIS - DAY

Jeanne gasps -- sways...

Torrential rain, sweeping across the grey, mud-filled moat
in great curtains.  She's standing on the bank above the
moat, looking across at the massive city walls where
ladders have been set up.  Aulon catches up with her...

		AULON
	Jeanne...!  Are you alright?

		JEANNE
	Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...
		   (yelling out)
	We need more brushwood!
		   (to Aulon)
	Why are you staring at me like that?

		AULON
	Because there's an arrow in your leg.

She looks down and there it is, poking out her leg:  an
arrow has penetrated her armor.

		JEANNE
	So there is...

She hadn't realized -- and doesn't seem that bothered.

		JEANNE
	... but that's no reason for you to
	stop.  You can still climb a ladder,
	can't you?  So go on then... climb!

Aulon looks across at the endless ladders, disappearing
into the mist and smoke at the top of the gigantic wall.
Jeanne calls out to her page, Raymond --

		JEANNE
	Raymond!  Over here!

Raymond hurries over...

		JEANNE
	Pull it out.

Raymond looks terrified --

		JEANNE
	Pull it out!

Raymond grips the arrow while Jeanne gazes across at one
of the ladders laden with Frenchmen.  As he pulls it out,
the ladder falls back, plunging the soldiers to their
deaths.  Jeanne gasps in pain...

La Hire and Gilles are further along the bank...

		GILLES
	This is no good!

		LA HIRE
	No good?  This is a disaster!

Gilles stumbles along the bank to Jeanne...

		GILLES
	Jeanne... The men are exhausted!

		JEANNE
	I know, but so is the enemy --
	they're falling back -- Paris is
	ours...!

		GILLES
	Jeanne... we're not enough...

		JEANNE
	So... bring up the reinforcements!

		GILLES
	Reinforcements?  Where??

Jeanne waves vaguely behind her --

		JEANNE
	Right behind us -- Dunois with
	another then thousand men!

		GILLES
	Jeanne, look behind you.

		JEANNE
	Never look behind -- only ahead!

Gilles grips her by the shoulders, forcing her to turn and
look behind.  At most, a hundred bedraggled soldiers,
limping amid the carnage in the moat.  Jeanne stares at
them.

		GILLES
	Do you know how to count?

		JEANNE
	Of course I do?  Bring them up!

		GILLES
	Jeanne... that is not ten thousand
	reinforcements -- that is one
	hundred very loyal but very tired
	soldiers.

		JEANNE
	But... where is Dunois... where are
	the men the king promised me?

		GILLES
	He never sent them... Don't you
	understand?  He doesn't want this
	war anymore... he has his crown now,
	that's all he ever wanted...

		JEANNE
	But my voices... they promised me...

		GILLES
	To hell with your voices -- it's
	time to face facts!  We have nothing
	to do here... none of us... not even
	you.  You should go home, Jeanne.

Jeanne stares at them, in shock.

		JEANNE
	You don't believe me anymore?

		LA HIRE
	We still believe in you, Jeanne.  If
	it were up to me, I'd chase every
	goddamn Englishman into the ocean.
	But it's not up to us anymore --
	it's up to the king...

Jeanne looks at him, suddenly furious --


INT.  CHINON CASTLE - CORRIDORS - DAY

-- Jeanne storms along a corridor, her two page boys doing
their best to catch up with her...


INT.  CHINON CASTLE - CHAMBER - DAY

She bursts in on Charles, who is cavorting in a bath-tub
with a few frivolous females.

		CHARLES
	Well, this is an unexpected
	pleasure.  Ladies, let me introduce
	you to the celebrated Jeanne...

The damsels titter...

		JEANNE
	Get them out of here!

		CHARLES
	Now hold on -- you're not captain
	here... on the battlefield perhaps,
	but not in the royal bedchamber!

		JEANNE
	Why did you betray me?  Paris was
	ours for the taking!  All I needed
	was another few hundred men... Why
	did you take back the army you gave
	me?

		CHARLES
	Gave you?  Well now, I wouldn't
	quite put it like that...

		JEANNE
		   (bluntly)
	So how would you put it?

		CHARLES
	Well... we are, of course,
	enormously grateful for your past
	efforts, but your task is done.  Now
	it's time for negotiation... and
	after many months of skillful work,
	our dear Tremoille is about to seal
	a treaty with our Burgundian friends
	who will no longer lend their
	support to the English.  You see, my
	dear Jeanne... as it is written in
	the Bible, "to everything there is a
	season:  a time for war, and a time
	for peace"...

		JEANNE
	Peace will only be got from the
	English at the end of a lance!

		CHARLES
	Why do you have to be so
	bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All
	that blood and noise and pain?
	Diplomacy is far more civilized...
	far safer... and far cheaper...

Jeanne angrily holds out a fistful of letters --

		JEANNE
	I have letters here from towns under
	siege -- Compiegne, Provins, Melin
	-- where the people are starving,
	begging God on their knees to help
	them... and I'm here to answer their
	prayers -- and you want to stop me?
	France does not belong to you,
	Charles -- she belongs to God.  And
	if you won't help me save her, I
	shall do it alone!

Jeanne slings the letters in his face and marches out of
the room.  Charles turns to the girls with a weary sigh.

		CHARLES
	If only she would just go home.


INT.  CORRIDOR - CHINON - DAY

Aulon reaches the door to a chapel to find it guarded by
Louis and Raymond.

		RAYMOND
	You can't go in.

		AULON
	Get out...!


INT.  CHAPEL - CHINON - DAY

Aulon enters to find Jeanne crumpled by the altar.  He
kneels beside her.

		AULON
	Jeanne... the king has ordered us
	not to ride with you anymore.

		JEANNE
	So... what am I supposed to do now?

Aulon hesitates.

		AULON
	What do your voices say?

Jeanne pauses... a long moment, whether or not to confide.
Finally, and with a bleakness not sensed in her before...

		JEANNE
	They've abandoned me... like
	everyone.

		AULON
	What... what do you mean?

		JEANNE
	It's been weeks since they spoke to
	me.  Since the coronation... no
	signs... nothing...

		AULON
	Maybe their silence is a sign...?
	Maybe it's a sign to go home?

		JEANNE
	It's not time yet.  My mission is
	not over yet.  There is still more I
	must do before I can really --
	finally -- go home.

		AULON
	But how do you know that these --
	these voices aren't really just --
	well, you.

Jeanne stares at him in bemusement -- then suddenly
laughs...

		JEANNE
	Well of course they're me!  That's
	how God talks to me.  If you listen
	hard enough, even you can hear him.
	Everyone can hear him.

		AULON
	But I hear so many voices... one
	voice saying one thing, another
	voice saying the opposite -- love
	your enemy, kill your enemy -- what
	is good, what is evil...?

		JEANNE
	All you have to do is stop talking
	and just listen.

		AULON
	But how do you know what you hear is
	the truth?

		JEANNE
	I don't know it.  I feel it.

		AULON
	You make it sound so simple...

		JEANNE
	The truth is always simple... it's
	you, Jean, who's making things
	complicated.

		AULON
	Me?!  It's not me, it's God who
	makes everything complicated!  If
	he's all-powerful, why not let the
	English stay on their island in the
	first place?  And why let this war
	go on for a hundred years?  And why
	send you out to fight when a girl
	like you should be at home with your
	family?  Why, why?!

		JEANNE
	So... even you don't believe in me
	anymore...

		AULON
	Jeanne... I believe in you... more
	than anyone...

Aulon's hand touches Jeanne's hair.  He leans forward, as
though being drawn by her eyes and mouth...

		AULON
	I... I just wish I could... I want
	to... to help you...

The moment is a little too intense.  They gaze at each
other, then Jeanne suddenly pulls away...

		JEANNE
	If you really want to help me,
	there's one thing you can do.

		AULON
	Tell me...

		JEANNE
	Tell the king to give me more men.

Jeanne goes, leaving Aulon alone, deliberating.


EXT.  CHINON - DAY

Jeanne and her pages mount their horses and ride off...


INT.  CHAMBERS - CHINON - DAY

Aulon walks through a small antechamber and is about to
knock at a door when he pauses, hearing familiar voices.

		TREMOILLE (O.S.)
	We have to stop her, your majesty.
	If she raises her own army and
	attacks the Burgundians at
	Compiegne, all my months of painful
	negotiations will have been in vain!

Aulon draws closer, shocked at what he hears...

		REGNAULT (O.S.)
	Tremoille is right.  She behaves as
	though she were God!  It's high time
	she found out who's really in
	command.


INT.  KING'S CHAMBERS - CHINON - DAY

Regnault, Tremoille and Yolande coil about Charles like
serpents.  Charles looks at them all.

		CHARLES
	It's true.  There's only one king...
	people need to be reminded of that.
	Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so
	much for us...

		YOLANDE
	I assure you, Charles, the Maiden
	has no greater admirer than myself.
	But whatever our personal feelings,
	we cannot allow her to conduct her
	own private war.  For the sake of
	the kingdom, it is imperative that
	you stop her going to Compiegne...

		CHARLES
	I... I can't stop her.

		TREMOILLE
	Well if you don't, I'm sure the
	Burgundians will be happy to oblige.
	If they capture her at Compiegne...

		REGNAULT
	... no one can blame us.

		CHARLES
	I... I don't know... it'll sound
	like we... betrayed her...?

		TREMOILLE
	Noooo!

		REGNAULT
	Good heavens no!

		TREMOILLE
	Never!

		YOLANDE
	Don't worry, Charles.  If God is
	still with her, she will be
	victorious.  We're not her judges...
	we're just spectators.  Let her go
	to Compiegne, as you let her go to
	Orleans, and let God decide her
	fate.

		CHARLES
	But... her army's so small now...

		YOLANDE
	Then her faith will have to be
	bigger.

Yolande gives Richmond a significant look.


INT.  CHAMBERS - CHINON - DAY

Aulon can scarcely believe what he has heard!


INT.  AULON'S ROOM - CHINON CASTLE - DAY

A table smashes against a stone wall... a chair splinters
in fragments.  Aulon is in a frenzy, smashing up
furniture.


EXT.  CHINON CASTLE - DAY

Aulon rides out from the castle...


EXT.  FOREST CLEARING - DAY

Jeanne and her meager band of soldiers have paused for
food.  Aulon makes his way through the trees -- and finds
Jeanne a little apart from the others, with her two page
boys...

		AULON
	Jeanne... I need to speak to you.
		   (pointedly)
	Alone.

Jeanne glances at him a moment, then nods for Louis and
Raymond to leave.

		JEANNE
	Did the king listen to you?

Aulon blushes... clears his throat...

		AULON
	Jeanne, I... I love you, Jeanne.  I
	love you and... I want to marry you.

Jeanne is a little taken aback, but is genuinely touched.

		JEANNE
	That's not what I asked... Why do
	you want to marry me?

		AULON
	You listen to your voices, I listen
	to my heart.

Jeanne looks at him a beat.

		JEANNE
	What did the king say?

		AULON
	He said that... he's making a treaty
	with the Duke of Burgundy and...

		JEANNE
	It's a trap!  They're buying time
	till they can bring over more
	soldiers from England!

		AULON
	Did your voices tell you that?  You
	told me you hadn't heard them for
	months...

		JEANNE
	No, but...

		AULON
	Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap
	-- her own trap -- a downward spiral
	that she can't stop?

		JEANNE
	Did you come back to marry me or to
	insult me?

		AULON
	To marry you.

A beat... then she looks away.

		JEANNE
	I will ask my voices... if they come
	back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm
	going to Compiegne.

		AULON
	Jeanne... I have been hearing voices
	-- and believe me, those voices left
	me in no doubt that you must not go
	to Compiegne!

She looks at him a moment, knowing that he speaks the
truth.

		AULON
	Jeanne... I believe in you -- but
	can you believe in me for once?
	Don't go... even if you don't want
	to marry me.

		JEANNE
	I would like to marry you.  But I
	have already promised myself... to
	God.

		AULON
	But... you've done so much for God
	as it is... can't you do something
	for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?

		JEANNE
	But it is what I want.

		AULON
	To be killed in battle?

		JEANNE
	If God wants me to win, he will find
	a way.  And if he wants me to die...
	if he wants me back... then that's
	fine too.  Then I'll be with him
	forever.

She has a dreamy, faraway look -- one with which Aulon
cannot compete.

		AULON
	Will you at least let me stay with
	you?

		JEANNE
	It would not be the same without
	you.


EXT.  COMPIEGNE - BATTLEFIELD - DAY

SHARP CUT to a Man being felled by a cudgel.  We are in
the middle of the battle, and things are not going well
for the French.  The citizens and their MAYOR watch
anxiously from the draw-bridge and the town walls.  Nearby
stands a familiar face:  the battle-scarred Richmond.  The
Mayor and Richmond exchange a glance that chills...

Jeanne is struggling to keep her banner aloft... then a
cry from close by, and to her horror she sees Raymond
collapse with an arrow in his breast.  His faithful
companion Louis races to his side, throwing his arms
around him.

Jeanne jumps down from her horse, but by the time she
reaches him, his eyes are closed.  Louis looks up at her,
tears brimming.  Aulon rides up alongside Jeanne...

		AULON
	We must sound the retreat!

		JEANNE
	Not yet!

With the enemy bearing down, there's no time to pause...


EXT.  COMPIEGNE - WALLS &amp; POV OF BATTLEFIELD - DAY

From high on the town walls, the Mayor surveys the distant
battle.  Richmond is standing a short distance away.  He
gives him a sign.  The Mayor turns to a Guard.

		MAYOR
	I can't risk the town's safety.
	Raise the drawbridge.


EXT.  COMPIEGNE - BATTLEFIELD - DAY

As Jeanne rides back with Aulon, she spots Richmond beyond
the drawbridge inside the town.  There's a brief exchange
between them, a locking of eyes.  Jeanne turns to Aulon...

		JEANNE
	Get back inside the town and see if
	the English are attacking from the
	other side!

		AULON
	But... why... what's the point?

		JEANNE
	Do as I say!

		AULON
	I want to stay with you...

		JEANNE
	That's an order!

Aulon looks almost shocked.  He backs away, then turns his
horse about and rides back across the drawbridge and into
the town.  Seconds later, the drawbridge begins to rise,
and Jeanne is trapped.

She tries to fight her way clear of the advancing English,
but they encircle her.  She lashes out with the flat of
her sword, trying to keep their swords and lances at bay.
The noose tightens -- her horse starts to panic... but
strangely there's a smile on her face, as though she sees
the end coming, this end that she so desires:  to die on a
battlefield in penance for the blood shed in her name.

Suddenly a BOLT slices through BONE --

-- and Jeanne's horse collapses from under her.  She rolls
to the ground, springing back to her feet as the English
close in.  Again she flays the air with her sword, but it
becomes heavier and heavier as her energy finally begins
to drain.

A huge iron ball smashes her sword in two -- now she has
no weapon but her fists.  Yet still she lashes out, like
a fox cornered by hounds.  Another blow -- she falls to
the ground, her face gazing up.  Her eyes soften, and
again that smile --

Her POV:  High above the dust and smoke and flame of
battle -- a little patch of blue...


EXT.  FIELD - SUMMER - DAY

... and Jeanne falls into the field of her childhood.

		JEANNE
	My Lord...

-- the sky brightens -- the SUN dazzles -- space/time
dilates... with her arms wide open, Jeanne offers herself
to the skies --

		JEANNE
	Take me...!

Nature starts to consume her, integrating her as a part of
the whole... clouds, seasons and wind become one in an
apocalyptic ballet... grass, flowers and roots consume
her... the camera suddenly pulls back so fast and far that
within seconds the earth has become a revolving sphere in
the darkness of space...

FLASH:  the sphere now becomes a four-dimensional torus, a
fluid, dynamic ring, evolving in and out of space...

FLASH:  the torus blinks, and the dark center becomes a
BLUE EYE, the same diameter as Jeanne's.  overwhelmed by
this vision.  A shadow of a MAN clutching a mace is
reflected in the blueness...

SHARP CUT to the Man as he slams her... WHAM!

BLACK.  Then a zillion stars evolve from the darkness,
slowly rotating inversely toward a central point as though
returning to the origin of space/time in one single
dimensionless point of light -- which then suddenly
EXPLODES...

At the same moment a HUGE EYE blinks open -- the EYE of
Jeanne...


INT.  COMPIEGNE - PRISON - NIGHT

Jeanne's eyes search a darkness that gradually resolves
into the grim, dank confines of a dungeon.  She sits bolt
upright, as though awakening from a nightmare.

She is on a wooden bed, her face bruised and tumefied.  A
few inches away is a MAN, one side of his shaved head
catching a sliver of light.  He's laughing at her.

		MAN
	I can't believe it... your romantic
	vision of death, with all that grass
	growing everywhere... I must admit,
	you have a great imagination.  Or
	maybe not great enough.  Death is
	much more simple...

FLASH:  A dead body lying in the silent forest, a trickle
of blood running from his mouth...

		MAN
	... after a few months it gets more
	interesting...

FLASH:  Same shot, only now the body is wriggling...

FLASH:  The body is now reduced to skin and bones...

		MAN
	... then -- after a year -- it
	finally becomes romantic...

FLASH:  The same spot in the forest, but now there is no
sign of the body.

Jeanne shakes her head...

		JEANNE
	Who... who are you...?

		MAN
	I am that I am.
		   (beat)
	You don't like my face?
		   (evidently not)
	Maybe you prefer this one...

His face melts into the little boy, sitting on a throne in
the middle of the wood.  She gazes at him in
bewilderment --

		MAN
	Too young maybe?  How about this one?

The boy becomes the young man she saw in the forest.
Jeanne is breathless.  The Man is invading her most secret
memories.

		MAN
	Better, no...?  But incomplete.

Suddenly his face is flooded with blood, like the image of
the man she saw during the battle of Orleans...

Jeanne SCREAMS, covering her face...

		JEANNE
	Get thee behind me.  Satan!

The Man smiles, unaffected by her outburst.

		MAN
	Who are you to even think you can
	know the difference between good and
	evil?  Are you God?

		JEANNE
	No... no... I'm just a messenger...
	He needs me... a higher calling...

Suddenly the man starts to bellow -- the walls tremble --
the bellow becomes a roar... clouds boil behind his
head...

		MAN
	HOW CAN YOU BEGIN TO IMAGINE THAT
	GOD, THE CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND
	EARTH, THE SOURCE OF ALL LIFE, COULD
	POSSIBLY NEED -- YOU?

Jeanne can no longer stop her tears...

		JEANNE
	I don't know... I thought...

		MAN
	YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO
	DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?

		JEANNE
	I don't know... please... tell me
	I'm dead...

		MAN
	WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD
	LIVE OR DIE?

		JEANNE
	I... don't know... what do you want
	from me?

		MAN
	Nothing.  I'm here to set you
	free...

The Man holds up his hand as though in judgment --

A hand slams across her face --

-- and she wakes up, nursing her hot cheek.  In front of
her:  the rough English guard who just struck her.

		GUARD
		   (angrily)
	I said, smile!  You have visitors.

The door opens, and a smart delegation arrives in her
cell, led by a thin reed of a man, the Duke of BURGUNDY
and his right-arm, DIJON.

		GUARD
	His Grace the Duke of Burgundy.

Jeanne stares at him, confused...

		BURGUNDY
	So... here is the famous Jeanne...
	Savior of Orleans... terror of the
	English?  You look pretty ordinary
	to me...

		JEANNE
	Am I... am I dead?

		BURGUNDY
	Dead you're worthless, darling.

		JEANNE
	Where... where am I?

		BURGUNDY
	Guess.

She looks about her dismal confines...

		JEANNE
	My king will pay any ransom you ask.

		BURGUNDY
	Your king?  Ah yes, of course...
	What's he going to pay me with?
	Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and
	the English have plenty.  I wonder
	how much they'll pay... to have the
	Witch of Orleans in their clutches?
	Those English are so arrogant, they
	can't accept the idea of being
	defeated by a peasant girl... it has
	to have been the devil's work.

		JEANNE
	God defeated the English, not me.

		BURGUNDY
	And God who allowed you to be
	caught?

Jeanne hadn't thought about that before.

		BURGUNDY
	Personally I don't believe in God,
	and I don't believe in the Devil
	either.  That's why I'm never
	disappointed.
		   (to Dijon)
	Sell her.


INT.  CHINON CASTLE - DAY

Aulon goes to see the King in his chamber and hands him a
heavy sack.  Tremoille and Regnault are present, as
always.

		AULON
	Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom.
	All the Captains gave what they
	could, as well as the citizens of
	Orleans and the other towns she
	saved...

		CHARLES
	Very generous of you all.  How much?

		AULON
	10,000 gold crowns.

From their expressions, this is clearly an enormous
amount.

		CHARLES
	10,000... that's a lot... but I fear
	not enough.  But it will be my
	pleasure to make up the difference.
		   (to Archbishop
		    Regnault)
	Your Grace... I place you in charge
	of this... sensitive negotiation.


INT.  OFFICE - DUKE OF BURGUNDY'S CASTLE - DAY

Burgundy's right-arm -- DIJON -- turns to his Assistant.

		DIJON
	They send a Bishop to negotiate?
	That's a good sign.  Let him in.

It is not Archbishop Regnault who enters, but another
ecclesiastic swaddled in the rich robes of his office:
the Bishop of Beauvais, one Pierre CAUCHON.

		CAUCHON
	Good day, sir.  I trust my honorable
	Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?

		DIJON
	He's feeling wonderful.

		CAUCHON
	Thanks be to God.

		DIJON
	And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?

		CAUCHON
	Not so well, I regret to say.  This
	business with the Maiden... it's
	caused him endless grief and
	torment.  That's why he's entrusted
	me with the task of... shall we
	say...

		DIJON
	Buying her?

		CAUCHON
	This word is -- regrettably
	appropriate for the situation.  In
	fact what we -- the Church -- wish
	to do is determine whether or not
	this girl is sent by God, as she
	claims.  You understand that we
	cannot allow just anybody to abuse
	God's name in this manner...

		DIJON
	I understand.  How much?

It is that other man of the cloth, Regnault, who answers.

		REGNAULT
	5,000 gold crowns.

		DIJON
	That's not a lot.

		REGNAULT
	It is all his majesty can afford.
	He has even donated his very own
	personal savings.  His majesty will
	greatly appreciate a gesture of good
	will in this delicate negotiation
	between our two families.

		DIJON
	I know... but the English want her
	very badly, and I have to tell you
	that they are proving much more
	generous.

		REGNAULT
	May I, without offending you,
	inquire how generous?

		DIJON
	20,000 gold crowns.

Regnault's rival cleric Cauchon looks aghast.

		CAUCHON
	20,000?!  But... I heard King
	Charles was... financially
	embarrassed.

		DIJON
	Don't look at the cost, look at what
	it brings.  What is your last offer?

		REGNAULT
	8,000.  We can't raise more... We
	can only place ourselves at the
	mercy of your generosity.

		DIJON
	I must offer to the Duke.  I will
	give you his answer tomorrow.


INT.  PRISON CELL - BEAUREVOIR - DAY

A Burgundian Soldier shakes Jeanne to wake her up.

		SOLDIER
	Hey, wake up... get yourself
	ready... you're leaving!

Jeanne opens her eyes as Cauchon enters her cell, dressed
in ecclesiastical robes.  He stands in front of her,
flanked by two monks.  At the sigh of the churchmen, she
brightens.

		JEANNE
	Oh, thank you Lord!
		   (to Cauchon)
	I'm so glad to see you!  I need to
	confess... I haven't been confessed
	since Easter... or been to Mass...
	Will you hear me now?

		CAUCHON
	I will hear you... but not now, not
	here.

		JEANNE
	Who are you?

		CAUCHON
	Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais.
	As you were captured in my diocese,
	the duty of conducting the trial
	falls upon me.

		JEANNE
	Trial?  What trial??

		CAUCHON
	Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of
	heresy.

		JEANNE
	But... the King -- my king -- didn't
	he pay my ransom?

		CAUCHON
	It seems that the English care more
	about you than the French.

		JEANNE
	The English??

		CAUCHON
	Yes.  They paid your ransom...
	tomorrow you will be transferred to
	their great castle at Rouen.

The door slams shut, and she is left alone.  Jeanne is
utterly distraught.  She looks round the bleak cell, then
moves over to a small window... just wide enough for her
to squeeze through.


EXT.  LEDGE - BEAUREVOIR - NIGHT

Jeanne clambers out onto a narrow ledge, high above the
frozen moat below.  Only a fool -- or one bent on suicide
-- would hazard such a leap.

		VOICE (O.S.)
	Need some help?

The Man we saw after Compiegne is once again behind her.

		JEANNE
	What are you doing out here?

		MAN
	I might ask you the same question.

		JEANNE
	I... I'm leaving... I can't take
	anymore...

		MAN
	And what exactly is it that you
	can't take anymore of?

		JEANNE
	Everything!  Prison -- humiliation
	-- being abandoned and betrayed by
	everyone -- I can't stand it anymore
	-- I'd rather die!

		MAN
	You'll be dead soon enough anyway,
	so why be in such a hurry?  Why not
	face up to your lies?  It's your
	lies you can't stand anymore...

		JEANNE
	I... I never lied!

		MAN
	If you were true to yourself... if
	your faith was firm, you wouldn't
	need to run away from yourself like
	this...

		JEANNE
	I am true -- to my Lord, the King of
	Heaven.  He knows how much I love
	him -- that's all that matters to
	me...

		MAN
	How can you pretend that you love
	God when you're about to throw away
	the most precious thing he gave you?
	Life is a gift, you should know that
	by now Jeanne -- a gift from God.
	You know what He'd say to you, if He
	was here?  "What are you doing to
	me, Jeanne?"

Jeanne is lost, exhausted, numbed.  She gazes into the
void, contemplating the fall...

		JEANNE
	You're right... I shouldn't do that.

The Man suddenly pushes her so that she nearly falls...

		MAN
	That's too easy.  One minute you
	want to die, the next you want to
	live...
		   (again pushes her)
	Do you think that life is a toy that
	can be played with and then broken
	when you don't want it anymore?

		JEANNE
	No, no... I'm just so tired, and
	lost, and... I didn't realize what I
	was doing!

He pushes her again...

		MAN
	Oh?  And just because you realize
	now, everybody else should forgive
	you?!

		JEANNE
	I don't know -- I don't care anymore
	-- I just want to be at peace!

		MAN
	Oh, so you don't want war anymore?
	You want to be at peace?  You want
	to be able to change your mind
	anytime you feel like it and expect
	everyone to go along with it?

		JEANNE
	I don't understand.  What do you
	want from me?

		MAN
	I told you already... I'm here to
	set you free...

Again the Man pushes her!  This time she loses her
balance, and with a startled cry falls from the ledge --
plunging down, down -- and crashing into the frozen
moat...!

Two castle GUARDS on watch are alerted by the SOUND of
splintering ice...

Jeanne is drowning, barely able to cling to the broken ice
around her.  The first Guard to reach the moat tests the
surface with his foot...

		GUARD #2
	Don't try -- you'll fall through!

The First Guard lies flat to spread his weight, then
crawls toward Jeanne...

		GUARD #1
	Good God, it's the prisoner!

The Second Guard glances up at the tower ledge far
above...

		GUARD #2
	If she jumped from up there, she's
	dead for sure!  forget it...

The First Guard reaches the edge of the hole just as
Jeanne disappears beneath the water.  He plunges in his
hand and grabs her hair, pulling her head back above the
water...


INT.  CORRIDOR - CHINON CASTLE - DAWN

Aulon races along castle corridors until he reaches a
door, guarded by two burly Guards...

		GUARD
	The king is occupied...!

		AULON
	Out of my way!


INT.  THRONE ROOM - CHINON CASTLE - DAY

Aulon bursts into the room to find Charles, Regnault and
Tremoille in conversation...

		CHARLES
	My dear Aulon...
		   (dismissing Guards)
	That's fine...

		AULON
	Jeanne's been badly injured!  She
	jumped from the top of a tower into
	a frozen moat!

Charles shivers at the thought.

		CHARLES
	It's a miracle she's not dead!

		AULON
	We have to do something before she
	tries it again!  I beg of you, my
	lord, don't let her down... let me
	organize an escape...

		CHARLES
	Jean, it's... it's not so easy...

		AULON
	But not impossible... Gilles and La
	Hire are ready to risk everything to
	save her...

		CHARLES
	Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why
	do you want to oppose the will of
	God?  Jeanne wanted to go to
	Compiegne -- we let her -- she got
	caught.  Then, on my personal
	orders, Regnault proposed 30,000
	crowns for her ransom, and once
	again the answer was no.  And now
	you say she tried to escape, and the
	answer is still no.  Jean, open your
	eyes -- can't you see the hand of
	God in all this?

		AULON
	No.  I see the hand of Tremoille,
	and Regnault, and Yolande, and
	you... and they are dirty hands.

		REGNAULT
	How can you speak such treachery
	when his majesty has done everything
	to try and save her?

		AULON
	Because I was at this door when you
	planned to betray her... and I was
	at Compiegne when she was betrayed.

Charles, Tremoille and Regnault are speechless.  Tremoille
breaks the silence --

		TREMOILLE
	Guards!  Arrest this traitor!

The Two Guards turn on Aulon, who readily dispatches them
with his sword.  Tremoille hides behind Charles just as
Aulon pins the King with the tip of his sword against his
windpipe.  It would now be an easy matter for Tremoille to
push Charles onto the tip of Aulon's sword.

		AULON
	What do you fear most now... my
	sword?
		   (eyeing Tremoille)
	... or his hands?

		CHARLES
	Tremoille... don't.  Please...

Tremoille hesitates a beat.  Still holding the tip of his
sword at Charles' throat, Aulon motions to Tremoille...

		AULON
	My sword is long enough for both of
	you.

Sweating now, Tremoille eases himself from behind the
King's back.  Charles exhales with relief.

		AULON
	I have always been loyal and true to
	you, but my allegiance is now at an
	end.  From now on, my loyalty
	belongs to Jeanne...

... and Aulon runs from the room, leaving Charles,
Tremoille and Regnault in a state of shock.


EXT.  CHINON CASTLE - DAY

Aulon gallops away from the castle...


EXT.  ROUEN CASTLE - DUSK

The great castle of Rouen, vast and bleak, silhouetted
against the dusk.


INT.  ROUEN CASTLE - CORRIDOR - DUSK

A Guard leads a group of wealthy-looking visitors along a
dank, dark corridor.

		GUARD
	... so don't say I didn't warn you!
	Don't touch her whatever you do --
	don't even stretch out your hand or
	she'll have one of your fingers off
	sooner than spit at you!

		WOMAN #1
	As savage as that, is she?

		GUARD
	Savage?  She's a monster!  At
	Orleans they say she drank her
	victim's blood!

		WOMAN #2
	Oh, it's too horrible!

The woman's escort takes advantage of the situation...

		MALE
	Don't worry, my sweet -- I'll have
	my sword at the ready...

They reach the door, and the Guard fumbles for the right
key.  The Duke of Bedford brings up the rear, escorting
his wife Anne, who is visibly pregnant...

		DUCHESS
	Don't you think this visit is a
	little... inappropriate?

		BEDFORD
	My dear, it's our duty... she's our
	guest!

The Guard unlocks the door, and the Group cautiously
enter.


INT.  JEANNE'S CELL - ROUEN CASTLE - NIGHT

The visitors glance about, but the cell appears empty --
until they look up.  An iron cage is hanging from the
middle of the ceiling.  In the center of the cage is a
body, dressed in rags and curled up like a wounded animal.

		BEDFORD
	Wake her up so we can see her face!

The Guard takes his cudgel and pokes her through the bars.

		GUARD
	Hey, wake up... we got noble guests
	-- don't disappoint them -- turn
	round!

He prods her in the ribs, and she turns to avoid further
pain.  Her face is swollen, her mouth parched, her eyes
full of grief.  The Duchess is stunned...

		GUARD
	Now she's sleepy but you wait and
	see -- any moment now and she'll
	start speaking to her devils, and
	then she'll get to yelping like a
	wolf in heat!  The other night she
	made her cage spin round so fast we
	thought she was going to fly away!

		WOMAN
	Oooo... she gives me creeps...

		GUARD
	Do you want her to stand up so you
	can get a better look?

		DUCHESS
	No.  But get her out of this cage
	and give her a decent bed.

The Guard looks stunned.  The Duchess turns to her
husband.

		DUCHESS
	I'm sorry, but this child is being
	treated like an animal!  Don't you
	think that whatever her crimes may
	be, she deserves a little more of
	our charity?

		BEDFORD
		   (whispering lightly)
	She's not a child, my dear -- she's
	a witch.


INT.  COURTROOM - ROUEN - DAY

Cauchon enters a large, gloomy courtroom and sits down,
surrounded by clerics, assessors, doctors of theology and
other churchmen.

		CAUCHON
	Let the prisoner be brought in.

The door opens and Jeanne is led in, her wrists and ankles
fettered, her face pale and drawn.  She stands in the
center of the room, isolated, alone.  A scribe dips his
quill in the ink and prepares to write on a blank sheet of
parchment.

		CAUCHON
	Our most serene and Christian King
	Henry the Sixth, King of England and
	France, has handed this girl over to
	us, accused of a number of heretical
	deeds, to be tried in a matter of
	faith.

Jeanne is hustled closer to Cauchon, who leans forward,
peering at her intently.

		CAUCHON
	Take the Holy Gospels in your hand
	and swear to tell the whole truth
	concerning everything you will be
	asked.

		JEANNE
	I don't know what you're going to
	ask me questions about.  You may ask
	things that I won't want to answer.

Jeanne's boldness takes everyone somewhat by surprise.

		CAUCHON
	You will swear to tell the truth
	about whatever you are asked.

		JEANNE
	I will willingly swear to tell the
	truth about earthly things, but as
	for my revelations, I've never told
	anyone except my king... Charles the
	Seventh... the one and only king of
	France.

There is murmured dissension among the judges.  We now see
that the Duke of Bedford is also in the room, together
with a small coterie of English observers.  Cauchon is
impatient.

		CAUCHON
	You must take the oath!  Not even a
	king, would refuse to take an oath
	to tell the truth in a matter of
	faith.

		JEANNE
	I will willingly swear to tell you
	what I am allowed to tell you, but
	as to the rest, even if you threaten
	to cut off my head, I still won't
	tell you.

Cauchon looks confused -- and aware that his authority is
slipping.  The judges and theologians are getting
agitated.

		CAUCHON
	So... begin by telling us your name
	-- assuming you're allowed to tell
	us that much?

		JEANNE
	My name is Jeanne.  My little cross
	I had round my neck was taken away
	from me.  I would like to have it
	back.

The Duchess touches the gold cross she has around her
neck.

		CAUCHON
	Show us a little more cooperation
	first.  Where were you born?

		JEANNE
	In a village called Domremy.

		CAUCHON
	How old are you?

		CAUCHON
	Nineteen... or thereabouts...

		CAUCHON
	Were you baptized?

		JEANNE
	Yes.  In the church at Domremy.

		CAUCHON
	Recite the Lord's Prayer.

		JEANNE
	Not unless you hear my confession.

Cauchon is getting impatient.

		CAUCHON
	Jeanne, listen to me very carefully.
	We are all men of faith, and we
	shall earnestly strive for the
	salvation of both your soul and body
	as though it were our own.  We do so
	in the name of our Holy Mother
	Church, who never closes her arms to
	those who would return to her.  But
	we cannot help you unless you submit
	to our learned judgment and
	authority.  Take heed of this
	charitable admonition, for if you
	persist in refusing our help, then
	we shall have no choice but to
	abandon you to the secular powers,
	and I think you know well enough the
	punishment that would await you.  So
	now... will you please recite Our
	Lord's Prayer?

		JEANNE
	Not unless you hear my confession.

The clerks and judges grow agitated, though we sense a few
are already beginning to warm to her, not least the
Duchess.

		CAUCHON
	Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not
	helping yourself by refusing to
	submit to our judgment...

		JEANNE
	And you be careful, you who claim to
	be my judges, for you too will be
	judged one day...!

The court explodes in protest, with cries of "Blasphemy!"
"She's possessed!"  "An infected limb!"  "Sorceress!"
Cauchon hammers on the table to restore order, calling
out --

		CAUCHON
	Guards!  Take the prisoner away!
	Clear the room!

Armed Guards hustle the clerics from the room while Jeanne
is led away, watched by the Duke and Duchess of Bedford...

Bedford turns to his aide (Buck) --

		BEDFORD
	I count on you to have it done.

		BUCK
	Uh... to have what done?

		BEDFORD
	I want her burned.

		BUCK
	As you say, sir.


INT.  ANTECHAMBER - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

The assessors look extremely uncomfortable, not least
Pierre Cauchon, who does his best to conceal it.

		CAUCHON
	Well... in the future I think we
	should conduct our enquiries in
	private -- away from public pressure
	-- so we can all be more... level-
	headed...

		ASSESSOR #1
	I think the church should wash its
	hands of this whole business.

		ASSESSOR #2
	Let the English burn her if they
	want to... why does it have to
	involve us?

Buck enters the room as an old Priest walks over...

		CAUCHON
	Because it's... it's our clear duty
	to root out heresy wherever it
	occurs.
		   (to the Old Priest)
	Father Vincente... you are the most
	venerable among us, what do you
	think?

		OLD PRIEST
	I think this trial is a masquerade,
	and I won't be part of it anymore.
	I am willing to be her judge, but
	not her executioner.  This young
	girl seems courageous and pious...
	she deserves to be well judged.

The Old Priest walks toward the door...

		CAUCHON
	That's what I'm trying to ensure!

		OLD PRIEST
	The verdict comes at the end of a
	trial, Cauchon, not at the
	beginning.  I am going back to Rome,
	to give me report to our Holy Father
	the Pope.

		CAUCHON
	This is ridiculous!  Now I'm the one
	who's on trial and being judged?!

		OLD PRIEST
	Yes... exactly as Jeanne predicted.

The Old Priest heads for the door, followed by the other
two.  Buck calls out to the Guards...

		BUCK
	Arrest them!

		CAUCHON
	What are you doing?  This is an
	ecclesiastical court -- you have no
	right to do this!

		BUCK
	Rouen is in English territory.  I
	have the right to do anything I
	like.
		   (to guards)
	Take them away.

Ignoring their protestations, the Guards hustle them away,
leaving the others in a state of high anxiety.


INT.  CELL - ROUEN CASTLE - NIGHT

Jeanne is in her cell, facing the wall and frantically
scratching it with her nails.  She is engraving a cross,
and her nails are covered with blood...

She is now kneeling in front of her cross, racing through
The Lord's Prayer as though on the run from the Devil...

		JEANNE
	Our father who is in heaven hallowed
	be thy name thy kingdom come in
	earth as it is in heaven forgive
	them that lead... forgive us that
	lead them... as we forgive them
	that... oh God, don't cut yourself
	off from me like this... I don't
	know what I'm meant to say or not
	say anymore... I don't even know
	what to think... oh, God, I'm so
	lost... don't abandon me like
	everyone else... please, I beg of
	you... at least say you can hear
	me...!  Tell me you hear me...!  Why
	won't you answer me?  Please, I beg
	of you -- ANSWER ME!

Suddenly "the Man" comes out of the wall, kneeling in
front of her and violently hitting his forehead against
hers --

		MAN
	Why were you yelling like that?!

		JEANNE
	What are you doing here?
		   (urgently)
	Please... leave... you can't stay
	here...

		MAN
	Why?  Are you waiting for someone
	else?

		JEANNE
	Yes!

		MAN
	Who?

Jeanne hesitates...

		JEANNE
	My... visions...

		MAN
	They're going to come and visit you
	in here?

		JEANNE
	Yes... that's what I pray for...!

		MAN
	I want to see that.  Do you mind if
	I stay... on the side?  I won't
	bother you.

		JEANNE
	No, no -- you can't stay or they
	won't come!

		MAN
	Why not?

		JEANNE
	Because... I have to be alone!

He smiles regretfully.

		MAN
	They won't come anyway.

		JEANNE
	What do you mean, they won't come?

		MAN
	Why would they?

		JEANNE
	Because!  Because I've always been
	faithful to God, and I've followed
	everything he said... and I've done
	everything he asked me...

		MAN
	God asked you to do something?

		JEANNE
	Yes... lots of things!

		MAN
	You mean God said, "I need you,
	Jeanne?"

		JEANNE
	No, but... he sent me so many signs!

		MAN
	What signs?

		JEANNE
	Like... like the wind... and the
	clouds... and... the bells... and
	what about that sword lying in the
	field... that was a sign...!

		MAN
	No.  That was a sword in a field.

		JEANNE
	But... it didn't just get there by
	itself.

		MAN
	True -- every event has an infinite
	number of causes -- but why pick one
	rather than another?  There are many
	ways a sword might find itself in a
	field...

FLASH:  A group of soldiers on horseback trot across the
field of Jeanne's childhood.  The last soldier's sword is
coming loose, and ends up falling into the long grass...

		MAN
	Seems a perfectly valid
	explanation... but how about this
	one...

FLASH:  Two young children are hurrying with the sword
when an old man calls them from far away --

		OLD MAN
	Hey, you little devils -- come back!

The two children drop the sword in the long grass (in the
same spot as before) and run off...

		MAN
	But then again, there are other
	possibilities...

FLASH:  A man is being chased across the field by a couple
of English soldiers out looting.  His heavy sword is
slowing him down -- he flings it into the long grass...

		MAN
	... or even faster...

FLASH:  The same man running across the field is suddenly
hit by an arrow from nowhere.  He drops the sword in the
long grass, but manages to stagger off into the forest...

		MAN
	... and that's without counting the
	inexplicable...

FLASH:  A man crosses the field.  For no apparent reason
whatsoever, he drops the sword and keeps on walking...

		MAN
	Yet from an infinite number of
	possibilities, you had to pick this
	one...

FLASH:  A peel of thunder -- clouds swirl -- a familiar
wind stirs the long grass -- a fabulous shaft of light
illuminates the patch -- the sword slowly descends from
the heavens and lands gently in the grass.  Mission
accomplished, the shaft of heavenly light disappears.

Jeanne is bewildered...

		MAN
	You didn't see what was, Jeanne.
	You saw what you wanted to see.

... speechless.


INT.  SMALL COURTROOM - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

We are now in a smaller, more intimate courtroom.  The
Duchess of Bedford is at the back, shielded behind the
theologians and doctors of the church.  Beaupere is
questioning Jeanne:  a cooler man than Cauchon.

		BEAUPERE
	This... "voice" that you say appears
	to you... is it an angel?  Or a
	saint?  Or does it come from God?

Jeanne is still in shock from her encounter with the Man.

		JEANNE
	I won't tell you more about that.
	I'm more afraid of displeasing Him
	than not answering you...

		BEAUPERE
	You're afraid of displeasing God
	when telling the truth?!

		JEANNE
	No...

		BEAUPERE
	Did God forbid you to tell the
	truth?

		JEANNE
	No.  But my revelations were for the
	King of France, not for you.

		D'ESTIVET
	When you saw your king for the first
	time, was there an angel over his
	head?

		JEANNE
	If there was, I didn't see it...

		D'ESTIVET
	Then why did your king believe in
	you without any proof?

		JEANNE
	Go and ask him yourself.

		CAUCHON
	Jeanne, you are not helping
	yourself.  If you don't answer our
	questions properly, your refusal
	will be taken into account.

		JEANNE
	These questions have nothing to do
	with your trial.

		CAUCHON
	I assure you they do.  So... answer
	me... when was the last time you
	heard this voice?

		JEANNE
	Not long ago...

		CAUCHON
	When exactly?  A day, a week --
	when?

		JEANNE
	Last night.

This takes the assessors by surprise.  Cauchon leans
forward.

		CAUCHON
	What were you doing when the voice
	came?

		JEANNE
	Praying.

		CAUCHON
	The voice was in your cell?

		JEANNE
	Yes.

		CAUCHON
	What did it tell you?

		JEANNE
	Many things...

		CAUCHON
	Did it give you advice?
		   (Jeanne hesitates)
	Good advice?

Jeanne hesitates...

		JEANNE
	Go onto the next question.

		BEAUPERE
	Good advice for the French, not for
	the English!  Do you think God hates
	the English?

		JEANNE
	I don't know, but you're all men of
	the church... why not ask Him
	yourself?

Cauchon tries to continue, but another theologian -- JEAN
MIDI -- gets in first.

		JEAN MIDI
	Do you consider yourself to be in a
	state of grace?

Jeanne looks perplexed... a beat...

		JEANNE
	Go on to the next question.

Cauchon seizes his opportunity...

		CAUCHON
	Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear
	this voice?

		JEANNE
	Yes...

		CAUCHON
	Is it here?  Now?  In this room?

Jeanne slowly looks at the assessors, staring at each in
turn.  They all look acutely uneasy, holding there
breath...

		JEANNE
	No.

Relief from the assessors, but Buck is far from happy.


INT.  ANTECHAMBER - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

Buck paces in front of Cauchon and a dozen clerics.

		BUCK
	Who's running this trial, you or
	her?  I can't believe it!  This
	wretched girl -- how dare she speak
	to us like that?

		CAUCHON
	She's loyal to her king... it's only
	to be expected that she...

Buck explodes with fury --

		BUCK
	There is only one king of France and
	that's our liege Lord Henry the
	Sixth!  It is written in black and
	white in the Treaty of Troyes --
	that you French bastards signed!

Buck presses a digit against Cauchon's sweaty forehead.

		CAUCHON
	I understand your impatience, but if
	you want this trial to be
	acknowledged as legal we must follow
	correct procedure and...

		BUCK
	To hell with procedure!  We paid a
	bloody fortune for this slut, and we
	can do whatever the hell we like
	with her, whether the church likes
	it or not -- is that clear?

		CAUCHON
	But if this trial seems fixed, I
	fear you'll have the very opposite
	result to the one you want...

		BUCK
	We want her burned as a witch!

		CAUCHON
	But in order to do so, the church
	must first prove her heresy, or else
	you'll be burning a martyr...

		BUCK
	Well then?  Start proving... or else
	the church will have another martyr!

Buck storms out, slamming the door behind him.


INT.  SMALL COURTROOM - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

Instruments of torture are brought into court by the
Executioner, who lays them out with due ceremony.

		D'ESTIVET
	You told us about the appearance of
	this... voice.  What exactly did you
	see?  Part of it... or all of it?

		JEANNE
	His face.

		D'ESTIVET
	Does he have hair?

		JEANNE
	Yes.

		D'ESTIVET
	Is it long and hanging down?

		JEANNE
	I'm more interested in what he says,
	not what he looks like.

		D'ESTIVET
	But if the devil were to take on the
	physical appearance of a saint or an
	angel... or a man... how would you
	recognize him?  By what he said?

		JEANNE
	Go on to the next question.

		D'ESTIVET
	That's enough!  You will answer the
	question... or face the
	consequences!

A beat... the Executioner readies...

		JEANNE
	If you were to tear me limb from
	limb and make my soul leave my body,
	I would tell you nothing more.  And
	if I did say anything, then
	afterward I would simply say that
	you dragged it out of me by force.
	Now... please... go onto the next
	question.


INT.  SMALL COURTROOM - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

CUT TO another session...

		JEAN LE MAISTRE
	Who told you to wear men's clothes?

		JEANNE
	The clothes are not important...

		JEAN LE MAISTRE
	You also cut your hair short like a
	man, and in the Bible it clearly
	states that it is an abomination for
	a woman to pretend to be a man!  It
	proves your desire to deceive...

		JEANNE
	It was just... more convenient as I
	was among soldiers...

		JEAN LE MAISTRE
	So you think you did well to cut
	your hair and dress as a man?

		JEANNE
	I... submit to Our Lord.

		JEAN LE MAISTRE
	But will you also submit to the
	decision of the Church?

		JEANNE
	It seems to me that the Church and
	Our Lord are one and the same.  Why
	must you complicate what is so
	simple?

Jean Le Maistre looks at Cauchon for help.

		CAUCHON
	Let me clarify things for you,
	Jeanne.  On the one hand there is
	the Church Triumphant, that is to
	say God, his saints, and the souls
	that are saved.  And then there is
	the Church Militant, that is to say
	our Holy Father the Pope, the
	cardinals, the prelates of the
	Church, the clergy, and all good
	Catholic Christians.  Moreover this
	Church, when assembled, is guided by
	the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot
	be in error.  That is why we ask you
	to submit to the Church Militant...
	that is to say, us.

		JEANNE
	So it is the Church Militant that
	refuses to confess me, and so
	prevents me from being a good
	Christian?

Cauchon bridles his temper.

		CAUCHON
	It is for us to determine whether
	you are a good Christian, not you.

		JEANNE
	I am sent by God, and I submit all
	my words and deeds to His judgment.
	Or do you think that you are better
	judges than He is?


INT.  SMALL COURTROOM - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

... and another session...

		MAITRE MAURICE
	When you were taken prisoner at
	Compiegne, did you have a horse?

		JEANNE
	Yes... a half-steed... white.

		MAITRE MAURICE
	Who gave you that horse?

		JEANNE
	My king.

		MAITRE MAURICE
	How many did he give you?

		JEANNE
	Five steeds and a few hackneys...

		MAITRE MAURICE
	As much as for a Lord?  What an
	honor!  Did your king give you other
	wealth apart from horses?

		JEANNE
	No.

		MAITRE MAURICE
	What about all those dresses you
	were given... silk dresses weren't
	they?

		JEANNE
	Yes, I was given a few, but I never
	had time to wear them...

		MAITRE MAURICE
	Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant
	girl wouldn't you say?

		JEANNE
	And you look pretty wealthy for a
	servant of God, wouldn't you say?

Maitre Maurice looks uncomfortably about him.  She's
right.

		BEAUPERE
	Is it true that you launched an
	attack on Paris?

		JEANNE
	I tried to.

		BEAUPERE
	It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?

		JEANNE
	I don't remember.  Maybe.

		BEAUPERE
	Do you think is was a good idea to
	launch an attack on a holy day?

		JEANNE
	I don't know...

		BEAUPERE
	And didn't you order the citizens of
	Paris to surrender the city in the
	name of the King of Heaven?

		JEANNE
	No... I said "Surrender in the name
	of the King of France"...

		BEAUPERE
	That is not what is written in the
	evidence... look for yourself!

Beaupere thrusts a document in her face...

		JEANNE
	I can't read.

		BEAUPERE
	Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an
	illiterate peasant to carry out such
	an important mission!  Do you think
	that God made the right decision, to
	take an ignorant girl to save the
	kingdom of France?

		JEANNE
	I leave the answer to God.

Beaupere is exasperated.  A sly-looking Theologian speaks
up.

		JEAN MIDI
	Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump
	from the tower at Beaurevoir?

		JEANNE
	I had been sold to the English.  I'd
	rather die than fall into their
	hands.

		JEAN MIDI
	Did your voice tell you to jump?

		JEANNE
	No...

		JEAN MIDI
	So when you jumped, you wanted to
	kill yourself?

		JEANNE
	No...!

		JEAN MIDI
	How can you deny it when you just
	said "I'd rather die than fall into
	the hands of the English"...?

		JEANNE
	That's now what I meant...

		JEAN MIDI
	Do you not know that suicide is a
	very grievous sin?  No one is
	allowed to destroy the life that God
	created!

		JEANNE
	I know, but that's not the way
	things happened...

		JEAN MIDI
	You mean it was not of your own free
	will that you were on the ledge?

		JEANNE
	Yes, but...

		JEAN MIDI
	And you didn't jump of your free
	will?

		JEANNE
	No!

		JEAN MIDI
		   (making fun of her)
	Oh?  Perhaps someone pushed you
	then?

They laugh.  Jeanne lowers her head.


INT.  SMALL COURTROOM - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

Yet another weary session...

		BEAUPERE
	Do you have a sword?

		JEANNE
	Quite a few.

		BEAUPERE
	Didn't you also carry a banner?

		JEANNE
	Yes...

		BEAUPERE
	Which did you prefer, your banner or
	your sword?

		JEANNE
	I was forty times more fond of my
	banner than my sword.

		BEAUPERE
	And why was that?  Did it have some
	particular value or power?

		JEANNE
	No, it's just... a sword is a
	weapon.

		BEAUPERE
	And?

		JEANNE
	And so I... I prefer my banner.

		BEAUPERE
	Why?

		JEANNE
	To avoid killing anyone.

		BEAUPERE
	Are you saying that if you had not
	been carrying your banner you'd have
	killed more people?

Jeanne is losing her confidence...

		JEANNE
	No, of course not... I never killed
	anyone...

		BEAUPERE
	Then perhaps the temptation to kill
	would have been stronger... too
	strong perhaps...?

		JEANNE
	No!  I warned the English to go back
	home -- I begged them not to force
	us to fight -- they knew the defeat
	I would bring on them... why didn't
	they listen to me?

		BEAUPERE
	We have numerous witnesses who can
	confirm that you were not always
	carrying your banner...

		JEANNE
	Yes, probably... maybe...

		BEAUPERE
	So sometimes you were carrying just
	your sword?

		JEANNE
	Yes, but...

		BEAUPERE
	Did you use the sword that you held
	in your hand?

		JEANNE
	No, I... I held it up to...

		BEAUPERE
	You held up your sword and
	flourished it about in the air?
	Like this?

		JEANNE
	Yes, maybe... I don't remember...

		BEAUPERE
	... so you were in the middle of the
	battlefield, with your sword in your
	hand, waving it above your head...
	charging against the enemy,
	screaming and yelling... fighting
	for your life... and you want us to
	believe that in the middle of all
	this excitement you never killed
	anyone?

		JEANNE
	No, I... I never killed anyone!

		MAN (O.S.)
	I can't believe you can lie like
	that!


INT.  JEANNE'S CELL - ROUEN CASTLE - NIGHT

Jeanne's fetter is once again attached to her chain, and
she's walking in circles, trying to escape "the Man"...

		JEANNE
	I'm not lying, I... I can't
	remember... leave me alone!

		MAN
	Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me
	help your memory...

FLASH:  an Englishman is skewed during the battle of
Orleans...

		JEANNE
	No!  I don't want to know anymore!
	Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that
	man!

		MAN
	Oh no?  How about this one?

FLASH:  another English soldier is killed...

		MAN
	Or this one?

FLASH:  ... and another...

		JEANNE
	Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The
	battles were all so confusing...
	there was so much smoke, dust,
	noise... I was being attacked on all
	sides, so... maybe... perhaps I
	fought back but it was only to
	defend myself...

		MAN
	So your memory's coming back?

		JEANNE
	Yes... yes!  And now you tell me
	why God let all these battles happen
	in the first place... if he's so
	powerful... he said he's "the
	creator of heaven and earth, the
	source of all life..." he could have
	easily stopped all this blood and
	misery?  Why didn't he?

		MAN
	Is he the one who spread all this
	blood and misery?

		JEANNE
	No, but... why didn't he stop it?
	Or did he get pleasure, watching us
	killing each other in his name?

		MAN
	In His name??

		JEANNE
	Yes!  We fought and killed in His
	name... the King of Heaven!

		MAN
	Really?

FLASH:  Jeanne is seated in her saddle before Orleans,
raising her standard with the cry --

		JEANNE
	Let all who love me follow me!

Back in Jeanne's cell:

		MAN
	"Let all who love me follow me"...
	Where does God get mentioned?
		   (Jeanne is cornered)
	Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You
	fought for yourself, in your name.

		JEANNE
	I... I was defending myself as best
	I could!  Everyone has the right to
	defend themselves, don't they?  Or
	should I have let myself be killed?

		MAN
	No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say
	well done.  Besides, most of the
	ones you killed probably deserved
	it, don't you think?

		JEANNE
	No, I do not think so.  I don't
	think that killing each other will
	ever bring peace.

		MAN
	I agree...

FLASHBACK:  Jeanne telling Charles --

		JEANNE
	Peace will only be got from the
	English at the end of a lance!

The Man looks at Jeanne, who is becoming unnerved...

		MAN
	I don't agree.  Why do you have to
	keep changing your mind all the
	time?

		JEANNE
	Why are you doing this to me??  Do
	you get pleasure from hurting me?

		MAN
	Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult
	word to define.  When does the pain
	end and the pleasure begin...?
	When did your pleasure begin with
	that sword in your hand...?

		JEANNE
	I never took pleasure in hurting
	anyone?

		MAN
	Really?

FLASH:  In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, Jeanne's face contorts --
a look of madness as she sweeps a sword across the
SCREEN...

		JEANNE
	Nnnnooooooooo!

Jeanne covers her face with her hands, sobbing in despair.

		JEANNE
	Help me... please... set me free!

The Man seems genuinely compassionate...

		MAN
	You will be, Jeanne.  You will be.


INT.  HALLWAY - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

A hooded Priest moves along the hallway, stopping in front
of the Guard.  He shows him his "pass" -- a heavy seal.
The Priest is Aulon in disguise.  The Guard looks at the
seal...

		AULON
	I'm replacing Father Demaury.  He's
	become very sick...

		GUARD
	It's amazing how many people have
	become suddenly very sick since the
	beginning of this trial... it must
	be this witch casting spells on
	them.  Burn her!

No doubt Aulon would like to stab the Guard right there,
but thinks better of it...

		AULON
	I'll do my best.

Aulon enters the court room...


INT.  COURTROOM - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

-- and sits on a bench, doing his best to look
inconspicuous.  He guardedly glances at Jeanne who seems
to be asleep on her feet.  Beaupere is whispering to
Cauchon, document in hand.  Beaupere beckons to the
Guard...

		BEAUPERE
	Wake her up.

The Guard pokes Jeanne in the ribs.  She seems almost used
to this kind of treatment, but is weaker.  Aulon seethes
with impotent rage, hidden behind his hood.

		JEAN MIDI
	So... let us summarize your
	situation.  You refuse to submit to
	the authority of the church militant
	by taking an oath; you made an
	assault on Paris on a Sunday; you
	hurled yourself down from the tower
	at Beaurevoir, and you persist in
	wearing male dress... I ask you
	again:  do you believe that you are
	in a state of grace?

Jeanne takes a deep breath...

		JEANNE
	If I am not, may God bring me there.
	If I am, may He keep me there.

The admiration of the assessors is almost tangible.


INT.  ANTECHAMBER - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

Buck sweeps everything off the table in a fit of anger.
Alone with him, Cauchon looks troubled.

		CAUCHON
	Calm down, my lord, I beg you!

		BUCK
	How can I calm down when I'm made
	the laughing-stock of the whole
	court?!  I've had enough!

		CAUCHON
	Be patient, my lord... you've seen
	how it is.  This girl has a way with
	people... but everyday we're making
	progress...

		BUCK
	So long as this bitch remains alive,
	our armies refuse to fight!  Don't
	you understand?  They want proof
	that God is on their side... and the
	only way they're going to believe
	that is when they see her being
	burnt as a witch!

Buck takes a mug and pours himself some wine, but the
carafe is empty...

		CAUCHON
	It is not for us to burn her, my
	lord.  That is your prerogative.

		BUCK
	... and your prerogative is to find
	her guilty...

		CAUCHON
	But we can't do that unless she
	admits to blasphemy...

		BUCK
	Well what are you waiting for?
	You've got a castle full of racks
	and ropes and pulleys:  go and
	torture the bitch!

Cauchon takes out his own personal hip-flask, his hand
visibly trembling as he pours Buck some liquor.

		CAUCHON
	You won't be able to drag anything
	from her that way.  You also must
	realize that many of my colleagues
	are... well, scared...

		BUCK
	Scared of a girl?

		CAUCHON
	Scared to make a mistake.  Supposing
	she's right... supposing she really
	has been sent by God??

Buck narrows his eyes.

		BUCK
	Whose side are you on, Cauchon?

		CAUCHON
	I'm on the side of our Mother Holy
	Church.  Besides, a confession under
	torture will never convince anyone
	of her guilt.

		BUCK
	Well find some other way!  Be
	creative.  Tell them she fucks the
	devil... Hmm, not a bad idea... why
	can't you say that?  Sounds good to
	me... and who can prove she doesn't?

Buck drains the liquor.

		CAUCHON
	One small problem, my lord.  The
	girl is a virgin.

Buck has a horrible glint in his eye.

		BUCK
	That is a very small problem.


INT./ EXT.  JEANNE'S CELL/COURTYARD - ROUEN - DAY

Jeanne is smoothing food into the cross she scratched into
the wall.  She does it with great care, as though
painting.  The Man appears in the background, watching
her.

		MAN
	What are you doing?

Jeanne is delighted and relieved to see him...

		JEANNE
	I -- I cleaned up my room, look...
	and I said my prayers... all of
	them... and...

		MAN
	What are you doing on the wall?

		JEANNE
	I'm trying to make my cross look
	more beautiful...

		MAN
	What for?

		JEANNE
	Because... because I don't know what
	else to do to please him.

		MAN
	Do you think this cross will protect
	you?

		JEANNE
	No, I...

Jeanne looks helpless.  The Man smiles, turns and looks
out of the window...

		MAN
	Look at them... with their beautiful
	cross...

Far below in the courtyard, a Priest is blessing a dozen
soldiers and their wooden cross.

		MAN
	... The sight of priests blessing
	entire armies before they go off to
	kill each other never ceases to
	amaze me.  And that these massacres
	should be recorded as acts of faith
	in God's name...
		   (no reaction from
		    Jeanne)
	And they think that making a
	beautiful cross or building a
	cathedral will wash away their
	sins... ridiculous!  Just like that
	priest who accused you of fighting
	on a Sunday.  Did God give
	permission to kill each other for
	the rest of the week?

In the courtyard, the soldiers mount their horses...

		JEANNE
	"Love your enemies"...

		MAN
		   (a satisfied smile)
	Good.  But "love your enemies"...
	body and soul.

Jeanne nods, knowing the truth but still not prepared to
admit it.

		JEANNE
	My voices... my voices... do you
	think they will ever come back?

		MAN
	I don't think so.

		JEANNE
	Are you going to leave me too?

		MAN
	Yes... of course... when you don't
	need me anymore.

		JEANNE
	Are you sent by God?

FLASH:  to Jeanne at Orleans...

		WOMAN
	But you've been sent by God!

		JEANNE
	So has everyone...

Back to the Man:

		MAN
	So has everyone...

Jeanne looks at him -- then at her cross -- then back at
the soldiers in the courtyard below.  With a lusty cry,
they set off at a gallop, blessed and ready for battle...

		JEANNE
	There's nothing for me to do here
	anymore... I don't belong here I
	want to be with Him now...

		MAN
	Do you think you are ready?

Jeanne stands up... comes and kneels before him, kissing
his hands.

		JEANNE
	Yes I am.

		MAN
	Are you willing to follow all His
	commandments?

		JEANNE
	Yes...

		MAN
	... to love your enemy as much as
	you love yourself?

Jeanne hesitates a moment -- a short amount of time, but
enough for a lie to slip in...

		JEANNE
	Yes.  I'm ready now.

The Man smiles.

		MAN
	Let's see.

She hears approaching footsteps... the SOUND of keys
jangling... a lock turns --

-- and the three SOLDIERS walk into the room.  The first
one has a familiar black beard.

		BLACKBEARD
	Now that's what I call booty!

He is none other than her sister's rapist and murderer.
Jeanne reacts in terror...

		JEANNE
	Oh no...

		BLACKBEARD
		   (undoing his belt)
	We thought you must be pretty bored
	in here, so we've come to liven you
	up a bit... right, lads?

		JEANNE
	Please -- don't do it -- don't hurt
	me --

		BLACKBEARD
	Of course not, sweetheart... if you
	promise to do as I say...

Blackbeard caresses her cheek and tries to force her legs
apart, but she resists -- whispers imploringly...

		JEANNE
	Where are you?  Don't leave me...
	please...

		BLACKBEARD
	Hey, come on... open up...!

His two comrades egg him on.  Jeanne struggles even
harder, and Blackbeard suddenly becomes violent.  He grabs
her by the throat, thrusts her against the bed and tears
off her clothes.  Jeanne suddenly goes berserk, yelling
and thrashing like a cornered animal.

		BLACKBEARD
	Stop screaming like that!  You'll
	wake up the whole bleedin' castle!

Blackbeard clamps his hand over her mouth, whereupon
Jeanne summons hidden reserves of strength, and in a
sudden surge manages to clamp her chains around
Blackbeard's neck... she presses down on the chains,
choking him, strangling him...!

The two other soldiers come to Blackbeard's rescue and
manage to haul her off.  Blackbeard gropes his throat,
then belts her across the face...

		BLACKBEARD
	Ah, so you want to play it rough?
	Good... I like it better that way!

He pulls out a knife and starts to tear at her clothes
while the two others hold her down.  Jeanne struggles for
her life -- yelling, spitting, biting, scratching --

Blackbeard is too excited to pay any attention.  Nor does
he notice the door open and the Duchess enter with the
Guard.

		DUCHESS
	Stop that at once!  That's an order!

But to Blackbeard, it could be Jeanne speaking.  The
Duchess, in her nightgown, grabs Blackbeard by the
shoulders...

		DUCHESS
	I command you to stop, in the name
	of the King!

The mention of the King jolts Blackbeard to attention...

		DUCHESS
	Leave her alone, do you hear?  Come
	on, get out!

The three soldiers back sheepishly away...

		BLACKBEARD
	We were just having a little fun,
	that's all, keeping her company.

		DUCHESS
	Men like you are the cause of our
	country's dishonor!

		BLACKBEARD
	We were serving our country... just
	obeying orders, ma'am...

The Duchess doesn't want to hear more...

		DUCHESS
	Go on, get out of here!

The Guards hustle the three soldiers from the room, but
not before Blackbeard has mumbled --

		BLACKBEARD
	See you later, angel.

The soldiers leave and the Guard bolts the door behind
them.  Jeanne curls up on her bed, destroyed, humiliated,
lost.  The Duchess caresses her face and doesn't know what
to do to comfort her.  The Guard brings a blanket --
probably his.

		JEANNE
	Thank you...

She wraps the blanket round Jeanne, and presses the little
cross back in her hand.

		DUCHESS
	This won't happen again, I give you
	my word.


INT.  ROOM - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

The Duchess storms into a room where Cauchon is talking
with Bedford and Buck.  She walks up to him...

		BEDFORD
	And... What a pleasant surprise...

... and slaps him across the face as he has never been
slapped before.

		DUCHESS
	You should know that each
	humiliation you inflict on this
	woman, you inflict on all women,
	including yours my lord.

		BEDFORD
	Wha... what on earth are you talking
	about?

		DUCHESS
	If you send anymore of your soldiers
	to Jeanne's cell... I will kill them
	myself.

The Duchess turns and sweeps past Cauchon, leaving Bedford
staring at Buck who looks decidedly embarrassed.  Bedford
turns to Cauchon...

		BEDFORD
	I'm giving you one more day.

Then he turns and leaves.


EXT.  CEMETERY OF ST. OUEN - DAY

A masked Executioner stands beside a stake, piled high
with faggots.  Jeanne, her hands bound, stands nearby,
facing a podium filled with the usual assembly of priests
and prelates, headed by Cauchon.  He rises to address
Jeanne.

		CAUCHON
	Jeanne, my very dear friend in
	Christ, we, your judges and
	assessors, desirous of reaching a
	true and lawful verdict, submitted a
	transcript of your trial to the
	University of Paris in order to
	obtain their opinion.  After careful
	consideration, the learned scholars
	have concluded with us that you have
	committed many grievous sins, and I
	ask you to listen most carefully to
	their opinion as contained in these
	articles.

Cauchon hands a manuscript to one of the assessors, Canon
Pierre Maurice, then resumes his seat.  Among the monks we
spot Aulon, who slowly tries to make his way toward
Jeanne.

		MAURICE
	Article One.  You have said that
	from an early age you have had
	revelations from the blessed saints
	and angels, that you have seen them
	with your own eyes, and that they
	speak to you.  As to this article,
	the learned scholars have declared
	that these claims are untrue,
	pernicious and evil, and that all
	such revelations are superstitious,
	and proceed from the devil.

The Duke of Bedford and his English peers are in a
separate stand, guarded by English soldiers.  The cemetery
walls and the branches of trees beyond are crowded with
spectators...

The English are impatient to carry out sentence, but
Maurice is not a man to be intimidated.  Jeanne seems
hardly aware of what is being said...

		MAURICE
	Article Two.  You said that by God's
	command you have continually worn
	men's clothes, and that you have
	also worn your hair short, without
	nothing...

From Jeanne's POV, Maurice's drone FADES, and the crowd
seems to disappear.  She whispers in agony...

		JEANNE
	My lord... don't abandon me... where
	are you?  Is this what you want?
	You want me to burn?  To burn
	without being confessed...?  I'll do
	anything you want... but don't leave
	me...

Jeanne is completely alone in the middle of the cemetery.
Only the graves, the stakes, and the moaning wind...

		JEANNE
	Don't leave me here... please...
	don't leave me alone!

Suddenly the crowd is back, with Maurice droning on.

		MAURICE
	Finally, Article Twelve.  You have
	said that you are not willing to
	submit yourself to the judgment of
	the Church Militant, but only to
	God.  As to this Article, the
	scholars say that you have no
	comprehension of the authority of
	the Church, that you have
	perniciously erred in the faith of
	God, and that you are a child of
	superstition, a wanderer from the
	Faith, an invoker of demons, a
	sorceress, an idolater and a
	heretic!

Maurice resumes his seat while Chatillon approaches
Jeanne.

		CHATILLON
	Jeanne, we once again admonish, beg
	and exhort you to cast out and
	recant your erroneous beliefs, and
	return into the way of truth by
	submitting yourself to the authority
	of our Mother Holy Church by signing
	this recantation.

Jeanne looks at the parchment in confusion...

		JEANNE
	If the church wants me to say that
	my visions are evil, then I don't
	believe in this church and I submit
	myself to the judgment of God!

Chatillon throws up his hands in despair.  Bedford is
brimming with anticipation.  He calls out to the
Executioner:

		BEDFORD
	Perform your office!

The Executioner turns to Jeanne, but before he can take
hold of her, Cauchon strides over --

		CAUCHON
	Wait!

Cauchon grabs the document from Chatillon and holds it up
to Jeanne...

		CAUCHON
	Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!
		   (Jeanne looks dazed)
	In God's name, don't you understand?
	I'm trying to save you!  If you
	don't sign, the English will burn
	you to death!  Is that what you
	want??

		JEANNE
	No... I want to be confessed.

Cauchon hands her a quill.  The English are getting
agitated, heckling Cauchon to hand her over, but the
spectators in the trees and on the wall are urging her
escape the pyre by signing.  Jeanne begins to waver...

		CAUCHON
	Sign this, and I will confess you
	myself if you want.

		JEANNE
	And may I go to Mass?

		CAUCHON
	As often as you like -- now, please
	-- for the love of God -- sign!!

Again Jeanne looks about for the Man... but sees only the
Executioner, waiting to conduct her to the stake.

		CAUCHON
	Sign, and you'll be free from your
	chains... free from the fire,
	Jeanne... now... sign!

The Crowd begins to chant... Sign, sign, sign!  Aulon, who
has managed to get closer, joins them...

		AULON
	Sign, Jeanne -- sign!

Bedford is in a panic as Jeanne takes the quill and makes
her mark -- a wavering cross at the bottom of the
parchment.  The Crowd cheers, Aulon is ecstatic... but
their voices go silent as the Man once again appears from
behind Cauchon.

		MAN
	You know what you just signed,
	Jeanne?  You just signed away my
	existence... For you I'm a lie, an
	illusion.
		   (Jeanne is horrified)
	You see?  In the end, you were the
	one who abandoned me...

		JEANNE
	No...

... the Man a smile of faint regret and disappears.
Jeanne turns to Cauchon...

		JEANNE
	Please... may I have it back...

		CAUCHON
	You have nothing to regret...

She tries to grab it from Cauchon, but soldiers pinion
her.

		JEANNE
	I didn't mean it!  I didn't know
	what I was signing!  You tricked
	me...!

		CAUCHON
	Silence her!
		   (soldier clamps hand
		    over her mouth)
	Take her away...!

The Soldiers hustle her away as Cauchon walks back to the
podium.  Aulon is relieved, and yet strangely
apprehensive.  Cauchon hands the Duke the document signed
by Jeanne.

		CAUCHON
	There... she has recanted, and we
	accept her repentance, for the
	church never closes her arms to
	those who return to the fold.  She's
	yours to do whatever you want with
	her, but the church has nothing to
	do with it anymore.  She's your
	prisoner -- your martyr -- not ours.

Bedford can't answer as the Duchess is next to him.


INT.  DUNGEON - ROUEN CASTLE - NIGHT

Jeanne is flung into a filthy dungeon.  Buck appears in
the doorway and flings male clothes in her face.

		BUCK
	Here... in case you want to get
	dressed -- try these for size!

		JEANNE
	He promised I'd be confessed... and
	go to Mass... and be free from these
	chains...!

		BUCK
	We never promised you anything!  But
	this much I can promise you... that
	you won't be leaving this dungeon
	till the day you die!

The Guards laugh, slamming and bolting the door behind
her.  Jeanne sinks to her knees in grief and anguish...


EXT.  ROUEN CASTLE - DAWN

Dawn is breaking beyond the distant castle...


INT.  CHURCH - DAY

Cauchon is alone, lost in his thoughts.  A young monk runs
in, out of breath...

		MONK
	My lord Bishop... come quickly...!


EXT.  COURTYARD - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

Cauchon and the Monk hurry across the castle courtyard.
Aulon sees them pass, anxious at their apparent concern...


INT.  DUNGEON - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

Cauchon arrives in Jeanne's dungeon, out of breath.  It is
full of people:  Bedford, his Aide, priests and soldiers.

		BEDFORD
	Ah, Cauchon... come to see for
	yourself?  Well, take a look.

Beyond them stands Jeanne, her back to us, dressed as a
man.

		BEDFORD
	You see?  Dressed as a man again!
	Her touching repentance didn't last
	very long, did it.  The Bishop of
	Senlis was passing by and was on
	hand to witness her very evident
	relapse.

		CAUCHON
	And by what miracle did these
	clothes find their way in here?

		BEDFORD
	Not a miracle, my dear Cauchon... an
	evil spell!  This girl is a witch,
	and tomorrow she will burn for it!
		   (to Buck)
	Have the stake prepared in the
	market place...!

Jeanne doesn't say a word.  She stands with her back to
us, gazing up at the dim crack of light bleeding in
through the high window-slit.  Bedford exits with the
others, leaving Cauchon alone with Jeanne.

		CAUCHON
	I don't understand, Jeanne... why
	did you do it?  Why?

		JEANNE
	And you?  Why did you lie?  You
	promised I could be confessed...

		CAUCHON
	I know, Jeanne... it was the only
	way to save you from the fire!

		JEANNE
	It's not my body I want to save.
	It's my soul.

Jeanne turns round, and we see that she is strangely calm,
as though a great weight had been lifted from her.  She
kneels before Cauchon...

		JEANNE
	I ask only one thing... to hear me
	in confession...

		CAUCHON
	I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear
	your confession... I'm sorry...

He hurries out of the cell.  A Guard locks the door behind
him, and Jeanne is alone.  But not for long.  The Man
materializes and sits next to her...

		MAN
	Do you really want to confess,
	Jeanne?
		   (Jeanne nods)
	I'm listening.

He turns his back, as the Priest did in the confessional.

		JEANNE
	I have committed sins, my Lord -- so
	many sins.  As a child, the only way
	I could help my people was to pray.
	So I prayed to God and his saints.
	I prayed more and more, and gave God
	all my love... but isn't it said
	that God helps them who help
	themselves?  So I helped myself...
	and I saw signs... the ones I wanted
	to see -- and I fought, out of
	revenge and despair.  Yes, I was
	proud -- stubborn -- selfish -- and
	cruel... I was all the things that
	humans believe they are allowed to
	be when they're fighting for a
	cause.

The Man smiles a little, satisfied sigh.

		MAN
	You think you are ready now?

		JEANNE
	Yes, my lord.

		MAN
	Let's see.

As he disappears, she hears a noise... turns round and
sees a Guard in the doorway...

A beat, then the Guard topples forward to the floor, blood
oozing from his mouth.  Behind him stands a Priest.  He
pulls a sword from the Guard's body, then throws back his
hood.  It is Aulon.  He runs to Jeanne and takes her in
his arms...

		AULON
	Jeanne... thank God!

He quickly sets about removing her chains from her
ankle...

		AULON
	We must hurry -- I took care of the
	guard, but others are coming...!

Jeanne gently caresses his hand...

		JEANNE
	I am ready now...

		AULON
	Just give me a moment and then
	you'll be free...

		JEANNE
	I'm already free...

		AULON
		   (preoccupied)
	Yes yes... any moment... you're
	always so impatient...

Jeanne puts her hand on his to stop him wasting his time.

		JEANNE
	My gentle Captain... I'm staying.

		AULON
	I -- I don't understand...

		JEANNE
	One day you will.

		AULON
	You don't know what you're saying.
	You're going to leave this place,
	Jeanne -- you're going home -- or
	whatever you want -- you're going to
	be happy, and have children, and...

She caresses his face with both hands, smiling at him
gently.  Aulon continues to talk, but his eyes are
beginning to brim with tears... he knows it's useless,
that Jeanne has made her decision...

		AULON
	... and maybe the king will give you
	some money, and a little land, and a
	title even...
		   (smiling through his
		    tears)
	... wouldn't that be a fine thing?
	You, a lady of title!

		JEANNE
	I'm staying, Jean.

		AULON
	No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need
	you -- so much has happened since
	you left... I have a new horse now,
	a white one, just like yours... and
	La Hire hardly swears at all
	anymore...
		   (crying)
	You can't stay -- they'll burn you!

		JEANNE
	I'm not afraid of the fire anymore.
	It will purify me...

		AULON
	Jeanne, you can't leave us like
	this!

Jeanne smiles at him...

		JEANNE
	I am at peace now, my gentle
	friend... at peace with myself.

She speaks gently, but with resolution:  there is no going
back, and Aulon knows it.  He hears the distant SOUND of
soldiers approaching...

Aulon takes Jeanne's face in his hands and kisses her on
the lips.  A full kiss, the only one and the last one, one
which Jeanne neither encourages nor resists.

		JEANNE
	You must go.

She says it gently but urgently.  With tears welling,
Aulon tears himself from her sight and disappears.  Jeanne
is left alone, strangely calm and serene.  Slowly she
raises her finger-tips to her lips... touches them
softly...

The Man emerges from the darkness, carrying an ornate
Cross on a long pole, bearing an effigy of the crucified
Christ.

		MAN
	Ego te absolvo, in nomine Patris, et
	Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, Amen...

He stands in front of her, raising the Cross above...


EXT.  ROUEN MARKET PLACE - DAY

... Jeanne, who looks up to see the crucifix rising
against a clear blue sky, now held aloft by a Priest.  She
is bound to the stake, her head shaved.  At the base of
the pyre, the EXECUTIONER sprinkles the faggots with
oil...

		EXECUTIONER
	Don't worry, it's going to be
	fast... I used plenty of dry wood so
	there'll be lots of smoke... but
	don't forget to breath fast and
	you'll be dizzy before the flames
	even get to you...

A great CROWD has assembled in the market place.  On a
podium is the Duke of Bedford, trying to remain impassive.
Beside him, the Duchess can barely contain her emotions.
Further along stands Cauchon, his eyes lowered, not
wanting to see.

Still disguised as a monk, Aulon stands close to the pyre,
tormented and torn between revenge and despair...

Bedford makes a sign to the Executioner, who then takes a
torch and sets fire to the brushwood.  Flames erupt, and
Jeanne's breathing quickens.  As thick smoke rises, the
Priest begins to cough; his eyes water, and he can no
longer hold up the cross to Jeanne's sight.  She begins to
panic, her eyes wildly searching...

		JEANNE
	... the... cross... show me the
	cross... please...

The Priest struggles to hold it up, but the choking smoke
drives him back.

		JEANNE
	Where... where are you...?

Jeanne is filled with panic... the Priest is bent double
with coughing and can get no closer...

		JEANNE
	... please... the cross!

Suddenly Aulon rushes forward, grabs the cross from the
Priest and boldly defies the smoke and flames, risking his
life as he holds it high for Jeanne...

Finally the cross is visible to her, rising above the
flames into a clear blue sky.  Her anxiety melts, her eyes
fill with tears of hope as she gazes up at the cross...

As her eyes close, the image of the cross becomes engulfed
with flames... until the smoke finally fills the SCREEN,
plunging it into darkness...

						CUT TO BLACK.

THE END
