Nixon (1995) movie scriptby Stephen J. Rivele, Christopher Wilkinson and Oliver Stone
More info about this movie on IMDb.com


A PROLOGUE APPEARS on a black screen:

"This film is an attempt to understand the truth of Richard
Nixon, thirty-seventh president of the United States.  It
is based on numerous public sources and on an incomplete
historical record.

In consideration of length, events and characters have been
condensed, and some scenes among protagonists have been
conjectured."

On a portable screen we read the famous words from Matthew:
"What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole
world and lose his own soul?"  This FADES into:

A BLACK AND WHITE 16-mm sales training FILM.  At the
moment, the sales manager, BOB, is chatting with EARL, a
rookie salesman.

          BOB
     Sure you've got a great product, Earl.
     But you have to remember what you're
     really selling.
          (then)
     Yourself.

INT. WATERGATE HOTEL - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Seven men in shirts and ties are seated around a table in a
darkened room.  They are smoking Cuban cigars, idly
watching the film.

TITLE: "JUNE 17, 1972."  Then: "THE WATERGATE HOTEL"

A BUSBOY yawns as he clears away the remains of dinner.  A
WAITER starts pouring Margaritas from a pitcher.

A balding man in his early fifties tosses a five onto the
table.  He is HOWARD HUNT.

          HUNT
     Just leave it.

The waiter puts down the pitcher, picks up the five, and
follows the busboy out of the room.

The moment the door closes behind them, GORDON LIDDY is on
his feet, locking the door.  OTHER MEN are visible, putting
on jackets, securing technical equipment from briefcases
and bags.  They are: FRANK STURGIS, BERNARD BARKER, EUGENIO
MARTINEZ, VIRGILIO GONZALES, and JAMES MCCORD.

          LIDDY
          (checks his watch)
     Zero-one-twenty-one.  Mark.

Sturgis rolls his eyes, drains his Margarita.  Liddy pulls
a wad of cash from his pocket, starts passing out hundred
dollar bills to his men.

          LIDDY (CONT'D)
     Just in case you need to buy a cop.
     But don't spend it all in one place.
     We're going to do McGovern's office
     later tonight.

McCord shakes his head.

          LIDDY (CONT'D)
     Orders from the White House, partner.

Liddy bypasses Hunt, who is browsing a folded Spanish
language paper.

          LIDDY (CONT'D)
     Howard ... What the hell?  What're you
     doing?

          HUNT
     Dogs ... Season starts tomorrow.
          (off Liddy's look)
     It keeps me calm.  I don't like going
     back into the same building four
     times.

Liddy mutters something didactic in German.

          HUNT (CONT'D)
     Mein Kampf?

          LIDDY
          (translates into English)
     "A warrior with nerves of steel is yet
     broken by a thread of silk."
     Nietzsche.

          HUNT
     Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with
     a shot of speed.

          LIDDY
          (to all)
     Remember -- listen up!  Fire team
     discipline is there at all times.
     Keep your radios on at all times
     during the entire penetration.  Check
     yourselves.  Phony ID's, no wallets,
     no keys.  We rendezvous where?  The
     Watergate, Room 214.  When?  At zero
     three-hundred.

          STURGIS
     Yawohl, mein fartenfuhrer.

          LIDDY
          (narrowing, waving his gun)
     Don't start with me, Frank, I'll make
     you a new asshole.

          HUNT
          (rising past them)
     Let's get the fuck out of here, shall
     we, ladies?

          LIDDY
     Anything goes wrong, head for your
     homes, just sit tight -- you'll hear
     from me or Howard.

          HUNT
          (aside)
     Personally, I'll be calling the
     President of the United States.

A nervous chuckle as Hunt follows Liddy out the main door.
The rest exit through the door behind the screen.

The FILM is ending.  Bob puts a hand on Earl's shoulder.

          BOB
     And remember, Earl: Always look 'em in
     the eye.
          (to the camera)
     Nothing sells like sincerity.

A BLACK SCREEN as the film rattles out, followed by a RADIO
REPORT over the darkened room, the sounds of doors closing.

          RADIO REPORT (V.O.)
     Five men wearing surgical gloves and
     business suits, and carrying cameras
     and electronic surveillance equipment,
     were arrested today in the
     headquarters of the Democratic
     National Committee in Washington.
     They were unarmed.
     Nobody knows yet why they were there
     or what they were looking for...

                         FADE IN TO:

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT (1973)

TITLES RUN - A raw November night.  We are looking through
the black iron bars of the fence towards the facade of the
Executive Mansion.  A LIGHT is on in a second floor room.

We move towards it through the bars, across the lawn.  Dead
leaves blow past.  A SUBTITLE READS: "NOVEMBER 1973"

A black LIMOUSINE slides up to the White House West Wing.
An armed GUARD with a black DOBERMAN approaches.

The window opens slightly.  The Guard peers in.  Then, he
opens the door.

          GUARD
     Good evening, General Haig.

GENERAL ALEXANDER HAIG gets out, walks up the steps.  He
carries a manila envelope.  As he enters the White House,
we hear an AUDIO MONTAGE of NEWS REPORTERS from the
previous year.  The VOICES fade in and out, overlap.

          REPORTERS (V.O.)
     Judge John Sirica today sentenced the
     Watergate burglars to terms ranging
     from up to forty years ... The White
     House continues to deny any
     involvement ...

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

HAIG enters, starts up the stairs.  The mansion is dark,
silent.  Like a tomb.

          REPORTERS (V.O.)
     Presidential counsel John Dean
     testified before the Senate Watergate
     Committee that the scandal reaches to
     the highest levels ...

MOVING: A low-angle shot of Haig's spit-shined shoes moving
down the long corridor of the second floor of the
Residence.

          REPORTERS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
     Presidential aides Haldeman and
     Ehrlichman were ordered to resign
     today ... In a stunning announcement,
     White House aid Alexander Butterfield
     revealed the existence of a secret
     taping system ...

CLOSE: on the manila envelope in Haig's hand.

          REPORTERS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
     The President has fired the Watergate
     Special Prosecutor, Archibald Cox,
     provoking the gravest constitutional
     crisis in American history ...

Haig stops at the door, quietly knocks.  No answer.

          REPORTERS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
     Judge Sirica has ordered the President
     to turn over his tapes ...

Haig opens the door.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - LINCOLN SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

The room is small, austere, dominated by a portrait of
LINCOLN over the fireplace.  HAIG stands in the doorway,
holding the envelope.

          HAIG
     These are the tapes you requested, Mr.
     President.

RICHARD NIXON is in shadow, silhouetted by the fire in the
hearth.  The air-conditioning is going full blast.

Haig crosses the room, opens the envelope, takes out a reel
of tape.

Nixon sits in a small armchair in a corner.  A Uher tape
recorder and a headset are on an end table at his elbow.
Next to it is a large tumbler of Scotch.

Haig hands the envelope containing the tapes to Nixon.

          NIXON
     This is June twentieth?

          HAIG
     It's marked.  Also there's June twenty
     third.  And this year -- March twenty
     first.  Those are the ones ...

Nixon squints at the label in the firelight.

          HAIG (CONT'D)
     ... the lawyers feel ... will be the
     basis of the ... proceedings.

Nixon tries to thread the tape.

          NIXON
     Nixon's never been any good with these
     things.

He drops the tape on the floor.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Cocksucker!

Haig picks up the tape.  Then he steps to the table,
reaches for the lamp.

          HAIG
     Do you mind?

Nixon gestures awkwardly.  Haig turns on the lamp.  For the
first time we can see Nixon's face: he hasn't slept in
days, dark circles, sagging jowls, five-o'-clock shadow.
He hates the light, slurs a strange growl -- the effect of
sleeping pills.

          HAIG (CONT'D)
     Sorry ...

          NIXON
          (gestures)
     ... go on.

Haig threads the tape.  Nixon, looking at it, remembers.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     ... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive
     none of this would've happened.  He
     would've protected the President.

          HAIG
     Mr. Hoover was a realist.

          NIXON
     I trusted Mitchell.  It was that damn
     big mouth wife of his.

          HAIG
     At least Mitchell stood up to it.

          NIXON
     Not like the others -- Dean, McCord,
     the rest ... We never got our side of
     the story out, Al.  People've
     forgotten.  I mean: "Fuck you, Mr.
     President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you
     Julie!" and all that shit, just words,
     but what violence!  The tear gassing,
     the riots, burning the draft cards,
     Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and
     they hate me for it -- the double
     dealing bastards.  They lionize that
     traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing
     secrets, but they jump all over me
     'cause it's Nixon.
          (repeats)
     ... They've always hated Nixon.

Haig finishes threading.

          HAIG
     May I say something, Mr. President?

          NIXON
     There's no secrets here, Al.

          HAIG
     You've never been a greater example to
     the country than you are now, sir, but
     ... but you need to get out more, sir,
     and talk to the people.  No one I know
     feels ... close to you.

Nixon looks at him, moved by his concern.

          NIXON
     I was never the buddy-buddy type, Al.
     You know, "Oh I couldn't sleep last
     night, I was thinking of my mother who
     beat me" -- all that kind of crap, you
     know the psychoanalysis bag ... My
     mother ... The more I'd spill my guts,
     the more they'd hate me.  I'd be what
     ... pathetic!  If I'd bugged out of
     Vietnam when they wanted, do you think
     Watergate would've ever happened?  You
     think the Establishment would've given
     a shit about a third-rate burglary?
     But did I?  Quit?  Did I pull out?

He stares, waits.

          HAIG
     No, sir, you did not.

          NIXON
     Damn right.  And there's still a
     helluva lotta people out there who
     wanna believe ... That's the point,
     isn't it?  They wanna believe in the
     President.

He suddenly tires of talking, rubs his hands over his face.

          HAIG
     You're all set, sir.  Just push this
     button.  Good night, Mr. President.

          NIXON
     You know, Al, men in your profession
     ... you give 'em a pistol and you
     leave the room.

          HAIG
     I don't have a pistol.

          NIXON
     'Night, Al.

Haig quietly closes the door.  Nixon takes a generous slug
of Scotch.  Then he looks down at the tape recorder.  He
puts on the Uher headset, and hits the fast-forward button:
high-speed VOICES.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Goddamn!

He hits stop, puts on his eyeglasses, studies the recorder
for a moment.  Pushes the "play" button.  VOICES.  Barely
audible at first.  Nixon leans closer, listening.

          NIXON (ON TAPE) (CONT'D)
     They did what?!  I don't understand.
     Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in
     the first place?

          HALDEMAN (ON TAPE)
     Evidently to install bugs and
     photograph documents.

                          FLASHBACK TO:

INT. EXEC OFFICE BLDG - NIXON OFFICE - DAY (1972)

SUBTITLE READS: "JUNE 1972."

Nixon's hideaway office in the Executive Office Building.
BOB HALDEMAN, his crew-cut, hard-edged chief of staff, sits
across the desk, a folder open on his lap.  Nixon, at his
desk, seems a healthier man than in the previous scene.
Also there are JOHN EHRLICHMAN, portly domestic advisor,
and JOHN DEAN, blond, gentrified, legal counsel.

          NIXON
     But O'Brien doesn't even use that
     office.  The Democrats've moved to
     Miami.  There's nothing there!

          HALDEMAN
     It was just a fishing expedition.
     Apparently it was their fourth attempt
     at the DNC.

          NIXON
     Their fourth!

          HALDEMAN
     It's possible they were looking for
     evidence of an illegal Howard Hughes
     donation to the Democrats, so the
     Democrats couldn't make an issue of
     your Hughes money.

          NIXON
     Contributions!  It was a legal
     contribution.  Who the hell authorized
     this?  Colson?

          EHRLICHMAN
          (shakes his head)
     Colson doesn't know about it; he's
     pure as a virgin on this one.  It's
     just not clear the burglars knew what
     they were looking for.  They were
     heading to McGovern's office later
     that night.

          NIXON
     Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?

          EHRLICHMAN
     Mitchell's out of his mind now.
     Martha just put her head through a
     plate-glass window.

          NIXON
     Jesus!  Through a window?

          HALDEMAN
     It was her wrist.  And it was through
     a plate-glass door.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Anyway, they had to take her to
     Bellevue.  Maybe she'll stay this
     time.

A beat.

          NIXON
     Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything
     to get John's attention.  If
     Mitchell'd been minding the store
     instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't
     have that kid Magruder runnin' some
     third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking
     pot?

          EHRLICHMAN
     Mitchell?

          NIXON
     No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests
     my Quaker patience to the breaking
     point.

          DEAN
     The bigger problem I see is this guy
     who was arrested, McCord -- James
     McCord -- he headed up security for
     the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns
     out to be ex-CIA.

          NIXON
     "Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as
     "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy
     League Establishment.  Is he one of
     these guys with a beef against us?

          EHRLICHMAN
     McCord? ...

          NIXON
     Find out what the hell he was doing at
     "CREEP."  This could be trouble.
     These CIA guys don't miss a trick.
     This could be a set-up.

INTERCUTS of all of these people arise as the scene runs --
McCord, Liddy, Magruder, Mitchell, Martha, Hunt, etc.

          HALDEMAN
          (with a look to Ehrlichman)
     We feel the bigger concern is Gordon
     Liddy ...

          NIXON
     That fruitcake!  What about him?

          HALDEMAN
     Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He
     used to work here with the "Plumbers"
     and now he's running this Watergate
     caper.  You remember his plan to
     firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as
     firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned
     fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just
     nutty enough to go off the
     reservation.

          NIXON
     What's Liddy got?

          HALDEMAN
     Apparently he was using some campaign
     cash that was laundered for us through
     Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could
     have a problem with that.

          DEAN
     ... But it'll just be a campaign
     finance violation ...

          HALDEMAN
     ... And if Liddy takes the rap for
     Watergate, we can take care of him ...

          NIXON
     I don't have time for all this shit!
          (to Haldeman)
     Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of
     the White House.  What else?
     Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna
     throw a tantrum again if I don't see
     him, threatening to quit ... again.
          (sighs)

          EHRLICHMAN
     Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of
     the people implicated is still, you
     see, on our White House payroll.

          NIXON
     Who?  Not another goddamn Cuban?

          HALDEMAN
     No, sir.  A guy named Hunt.

Nixon stops, stunned.

          NIXON
     Hunt?  Howard Hunt?

          EHRLICHMAN
     He left his White House phone number
     in his hotel room.

          HALDEMAN
     He works for Colson.  He used him on
     the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to
     figure out when he officially stopped
     being a White House consultant.  After
     the arrest he dumped his wiretapping
     stuff into his White House safe.

          NIXON
          (incredulous)
     Howard Hunt is working for the White
     House?  No shit!  This is goddamn
     Disneyland!  Since when?

          EHRLICHMAN
     Chappaquiddick.  You wanted some dirt
     on Kennedy.  Colson brought him in.

          DEAN
     You know Hunt, sir?

          NIXON
          (perturbed)
     On the list of horribles, I know what
     he is.  And I know what he tracks back
     to.
          (then)
     You say he was involved in the
     Plumbers?

          HALDEMAN
     Definitely.  Colson had him trying to
     break into Bremer's apartment after
     Bremer shot Wallace, to plant McGovern
     campaign literature.

          NIXON
          (lofty)
     I had nothing to do with that.  Was he
     ... in the Ellsberg thing?

          HALDEMAN
     Yes, you approved it, sir.

          NIXON
     I did?

          HALDEMAN
     It was right after the Pentagon Papers
     broke.  They went in to get his
     psychiatric records.

          NIXON
     Fucking hell.

          HALDEMAN
     We were working on China.

Nixon has a seat, shaken.  He stares right at us, as we:

                    SHARP CUT BACK TO:

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY (1971)

The PRESIDENT'S MEN are gathered in somber silence, sharing
front page copies of the New York Times.  SUBTITLE READS:
"JUNE 1971 - A YEAR EARLIER"

INSERT HEADLINE: "Secret Pentagon Study Details Descent
into Vietnam"; "Pentagon Papers Expose Government Lies."

The technique we've established of an AUDIO MONTAGE of
REPORTER'S VOICES continues over the scene.

          REPORTERS (V.O.)
     The New York Times began publishing
     today the first in a series of forty
     seven volumes of top secret Pentagon
     Papers relating to the war in Vietnam.
     The papers reveal a systematic pattern
     of government lies about American
     involvement in the war ...

Nixon throws down the paper in disgust and attempts to feed
his Irish setter, KING TIMAHOE, a biscuit, as HENRY
KISSINGER paces the room, the most upset of all.

          KISSINGER
     Mr. President, we are in a
     revolutionary situation.  We are under
     siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen;
     The State Department under Rogers is
     leaking like a sieve.  And now this
     insignificant little shit Ellsberg
     publishing all the diplomatic secrets
     of this country will destroy our
     ability to conduct foreign policy.

          NIXON
          (feeding the dog)
     Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated
     as you, Henry, but don't you think
     this one's a Democrat problem.  They
     started the war; it makes them look
     bad.

Kissinger lowers his voice for effect, pounds the desk.

          KISSINGER
     Mr. President, how we can look the
     Soviets or the Chinese in the eye now
     and have any credibility when any
     traitor can leak!  Even the
     Vietnamese, tawdry little shits that
     they are, will never -- never -- agree
     to secret negotiations with us.  This
     makes you look like a weakling, Mr.
     President.

          HALDEMAN
     He's right about one thing, sir.  I
     spoke with Lyndon.  This Pentagon
     Papers business has knocked the shit
     out of him.  Complete collapse,
     massive depression.  He feels the
     country is lost, that you as President
     can't govern anymore.

          NIXON
          (irritated)
     Goddamn!
     How long have we had this fucking
     dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't
     come!  We need a dog that looks happy
     when the press is around.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog
     bones?

          KISSINGER
          (end of his patience)
     Mr. President, the Vietnamese, the
     Russians ...

Nixon finally throws the biscuit at the dog, glares at
Kissinger.

          NIXON
          (to Ehrlichman)
     Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!
          (to Kissinger)
     It's your fault, Henry.

          KISSINGER
     I beg your pardon --

          NIXON
     It's your people who are leaking to
     the Times.  Wasn't this Ellsberg a
     student of yours at Harvard?  He was
     your idea; why are you suddenly
     running for cover?

          KISSINGER
     He was, he was.  We taught a class
     together at Harvard.  But you know
     these back-stabbing Ivy League
     intellectuals, they can't ...

          NIXON
          (cold)
     No, Henry.  I don't.

          KISSINGER
     He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot
     people from helicopters in Vietnam, he
     has sexual relations with his wife in
     front of their children.  He sees a
     shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up.
     Now he's trying to be a hero to the
     liberals ... If he gets away with it,
     everybody will follow his lead.  He
     must be stopped at all costs.

          COLSON
     Sir, if I might?

          NIXON
     Go, Chuck.

          COLSON
     For three years now I've watched
     people in this government promote
     themselves, ignoring your orders,
     embarrassing your administration.  It
     makes me sick!  We've played by the
     rules and it doesn't work!

          MITCHELL
          (to Nixon)
     We can prosecute the New York Times,
     go for an injunction ...

          NIXON
     ... but it's not, bottom-line, gonna
     change a goddamn thing, John.  The
     question is: How do we screw Ellsberg
     so bad it puts the fear of God into
     all leakers?

          COLSON
     Can we link Ellsberg to the Russians?

          NIXON
     Good, I like that.  The other issue
     is: How the hell do we plug these
     leaks once and for all?  Who the
     hell's talking to the press?
          (he looks directly at Henry)
     Henry, for two goddamn years you've
     put wiretaps on your own people.

          KISSINGER
     To protect you, Mr. President.

          COLSON
          (interjects)
     To protect yourself is more like it.
     The pot calling the kettle ...

Kissinger throws Colson a vicious look, while Nixon ignores
it.

          KISSINGER
          (aside)
     Who are you talking to like this, you
     insignificant shit ...

          NIXON
     ... and what do we get for it?  Gobs
     and gobs of bullshit, gossip, nothing!
     Someone is leaking.
     We've got to stop the leaks, Henry, at
     any cost, do you hear me?  Then we can
     go for the big play -- China, Russia.

          COLSON
     Mr. President, we can do this
     ourselves.  The CIA and the FBI aren't
     doing the job.  But we can create our
     own intelligence unit -- right here,
     inside the White House.

A slow move in on Nixon as he thinks about it.

          NIXON
     Well, why not?

          HALDEMAN
     Our own intelligence capability -- to
     fix the leaks?

          COLSON
     Yeah, like the Plumbers.

Nixon smiles.

          NIXON
     I like it.  I like the idea.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Is it legal?
          (a beat)
     I mean has anyone ever done it before?

          NIXON
     Sure.  Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean,
     Truman cut the shit out of my
     investigation of Hiss back in '48.

          MITCHELL
     It was illegal, what he did.

          NIXON
     You know, this kinda thing, you gotta
     be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole
     damn place should be fired.  Really.
     You do it like the Germans in World
     War II.  If they went through these
     towns and a sniper hit one of them,
     they'd line the whole goddamned town
     up and say: "Until you talk you're all
     getting shot."  I really think that's
     what has to be done.  I don't think
     you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...

          COLSON
     Just whisper the word to me, sir, and
     I'll shoot Ellsberg myself.

          EHRLICHMAN
     We're not the Germans, sir ...

          NIXON
     Ellsberg's not the issue.  The
     Pentagon Papers aren't the issue.
          (almost to himself)
     It's the lie.

A pause.  Everyone in the room chews on this for a moment.
Mitchell, the oldest in the group, smokes on his pipe,
stone-faced.

          MITCHELL
     The lie?

          NIXON
     You remember, John, in '48 -- no one
     believed Alger Hiss was a communist.
     Except me.  They loved Hiss just like
     they loved this Ellsberg character.
     East Coast, Ivy League.  He was their
     kind.  I was dirt to them.  Nothing.

As they talk, a MONTAGE arises of ALGER HISS and the days
of old -- the photographs of the notorious 1948 Hiss case:
HISS, CHAMBERS, the YOUNGER NIXON with the microfilm; a
headline reading "HISS FOUND GUILTY"; TRUMAN, ELEANOR
ROOSEVELT, a beaming EISENHOWER shaking Nixon's hand.

          MITCHELL
          (to the room)
     And Dick beat the shit out of them.

          NIXON
     But I wouldn't have if Hiss hadn't
     lied about knowing Chambers.  The
     documents were old and out of date,
     like these Pentagon Papers.  The key
     thing we proved was that Hiss was a
     liar.  Then people bought it that he
     was a spy.
          (then)
     It's the lie that gets you.

          MITCHELL
          (to the room)
     Hiss was protecting his wife.  I've
     always believed that.

          NIXON
          (cryptically)
     When they know you've got something to
     protect, that's when they fuck you!

          HALDEMAN
     What's this faggot, Ellsberg,
     protecting?

          COLSON
     His liberal elitist friends.  His
     Harvard-Ph.D.-I-shit-holier-than-thou
     attitude.

Kissinger waits.  Nixon acknowledges him.  The camera is
moving tighter and tighter on the President.  His
expression is furious, his words violent.

          NIXON
     Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your
     way.  Crush this Ellsberg character
     the same way we did Hiss!

          KISSINGER
          (interjects)
     There's no other choice.

          NIXON
     We're gonna hit him so hard he looks
     like everything that's sick and evil
     about the Eastern Establishment.
          (to Colson)
     You and your "plumbers" are gonna find
     dirt on this guy -- let's see him
     going to the bathroom in front of the
     American public!  And when we finish
     with him, they'll crucify him!

                          FLASH CUT TO:

INT. FIELDING PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - NIGHT (1971)

SUBTITLE READS: "ELLSBERG'S PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - 1971"

ANOTHER BREAK-IN is in effect.  LIDDY in wig, thick
glasses, false teeth, and THREE CUBANS (Barker, Martinez
from Watergate, and de Diego, not at Watergate) are
visible, moving through, smashing up the office.  In CLOSE
UPS, we see hands jerking open filing cabinets, pulling the
drawers out of desks.

          REPORTERS (V.O.)
     The Nixon Administration responded by
     filing an injunction against the New
     York Times to prevent further
     publication ... President Nixon
     condemned the Pentagon Papers as the
     worst breach of national security in
     U.S. history ... Daniel Ellsberg, who
     leaked the papers, was charged today
     in federal court ...

While this is going on, a powerful FLASHBULB keeps popping.
The photographer, looking for evidence, suddenly catches
his partner in the light, his startled face buried beneath
a 70's wig -- HOWARD HUNT.  Hunt is pissed:

          HUNT
     Fuck you -- gimme that fucking film!

                         BACK TO:

INT. EXEC OFFICE BLDG - NIXON OFFICE - DAY (1972)

RESUME - CLOSE on NIXON remembering Howard Hunt, as
HALDEMAN looks on.

          NIXON
     Howard Hunt? ... Jesus Christ, you
     open up that scab ... and you uncover
     a lot of pus.

          HALDEMAN
     What do you mean, sir?

Nixon chooses not to answer.

          NIXON
     Where's Hunt now?

          EHRLICHMAN
     In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to
     me.

          NIXON
     And?

          EHRLICHMAN
     He wants money.

          NIXON
     Pay him.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Pay him?  I told him to get out of the
     country.  It's crazy to start ...

          NIXON
     What the hell are you doing,
     Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I
     don't care how much he wants -- pay
     him.

          HALDEMAN
     But what are we paying him for?

          NIXON
     Silence!

          HALDEMAN
     But, sir, you're covered -- no one
     here gave orders to break into the
     damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's
     only the Ellsberg thing, and if that
     comes out, it's "national security."

          NIXON
     "Security" is not strong enough.

          HALDEMAN
     How about a COMINT classification?  We
     put it on the Huston plan.  Even the
     designation is classified.

          NIXON
     "National Priority."

          EHRLICHMAN
     "Priority?"  How about "secret, top
     secret"?

          DEAN
     I was thinking "sensitive."

          NIXON
     "National security priority restricted
     and controlled secret."

          HALDEMAN
     We'll work on it.  I say we cut
     ourselves loose from these clowns and
     that's all there is to it.

A beat.  Nixon looks out at the Rose Garden.

          NIXON
     It's more than that.  It could be more
     than that.  I want Hunt paid.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Uh, we've never done this before, sir
     ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?
          (smirks)
     Do you fill a black bag full of
     unmarked bills?

          NIXON
          (snaps)
     This is not a joke, John!

          EHRLICHMAN
     No, sir.

          NIXON
     We should set up a Cuban defense fund
     on this; take care of all of them.

          HALDEMAN
     Should we talk to Trini about paying
     these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?

          NIXON
     No, keep Trini out of this.
     Chotiner's too old.  And for God's
     sake, keep Colson out.
          (including Dean)
     It's time to baptize our young
     counsel.  That means Dean can never
     talk about it.  Attorney-client
     privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean --
     you stay close on this.

          DEAN
     Yes, sir, don't worry --

Prompted, Ehrlichman and Dean leave.  When the door closes:

          NIXON
     Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing?
     You know, I'm glad we tape all these
     conversations because ... I never
     approved that break-in at Ellsberg's
     psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it
     after the fact?  Someday we've got to
     start transcribing the tapes.

          HALDEMAN
     You approved that before the fact,
     because I went over it with you.  But
     ...

          NIXON
     Uh, no one, of course, is going to see
     these tapes, but ...

          HALDEMAN
     That's right, and it's more a problem
     for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with
     the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else
     does Hunt have on us?

Again, Nixon chooses not to answer.

          NIXON
     We've got to turn off the FBI.  You
     just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell
     Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing
     the President.  Tell him that Hunt and
     his Cuban friends know too damn much,
     and if he goes public, it would be a
     fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what
     I'm talking about.

          HALDEMAN
          (still confused)
     All right.

          NIXON
     Play it tough.  That's the way they
     play it and that's the way we're going
     to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and
     say there's no involvement, but just
     say this is sort of a comedy of
     errors, bizarre, without getting into
     it.  Say the President believes it's
     going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs
     thing again.  Tell Helms he should
     call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say
     that we wish for the sake of the
     country -- don't go any further into
     this hanky-panky, period!

          HALDEMAN
     The Bay of Pigs? ... That was
     Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that
     threaten us?

          NIXON
     Just do what I say, Bob.

          HALDEMAN
     Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll
     go for it?

          NIXON
     Pat Gray'll do anything we ask him.
     That's why I appointed him.

          HALDEMAN
     He'll need a pretext.  He'll never
     figure one out for himself.

          NIXON
          (sighs)
     Christ, you're right -- Gray makes
     Jerry Ford look like Mozart.
          (then)
     Just have Helms call him.  Helms can
     scare anybody.

          HALDEMAN
     The only problem with that, sir -- it
     gets us into obstruction of justice.

          NIXON
     It's got nothing to do with justice.
     It's national security.

          HALDEMAN
     How is this national security?

          NIXON
     Because the President says it is.  My
     job is to protect this country from
     its enemies, and its enemies are
     inside the walls.

Pause.  Haldeman is perplexed.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     I suppose you thought the Presidency
     was above this sort of thing.

          HALDEMAN
     Sir?

          NIXON
     This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We
     have to keep our enemies at bay or our
     whole program is gonna go down the
     tubes.  The FBI is filled with people
     who are pissed that I put Gray in and
     not one of their own.  Vietnam, China,
     the Soviet Union: when you look at the
     big picture, Bob, you'll see we're
     doing a hell of a lotta good in this
     world.  Let's not screw it up with
     some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.

          HALDEMAN
     I'll talk to Helms.
          (looks at his watch)
     Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the
     Residence for dinner tonight.

          NIXON
     No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in
     here.  I have too much to do.

          HALDEMAN
     Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh
     ... what's our press position on this
     Watergate thing?  What do I tell
     Ziegler to tell them?

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - LINCOLN SITTING ROOM - NIGHT (1973)

RESUME SCENE - NIXON takes another drink, looks up at
Lincoln's portrait.

          NIXON (ON TAPE)
          (yelling)
     Tell 'em what we've always told 'em!
     Tell 'em anything but the goddamn
     truth!

As the tape grinds on with hard-to-hear DIALOGUE, Nixon
searches through a drawer in the rolltop desk next to the
fireplace.  He finds a small vial of pills, fumbles with
the cap.  He rips the cap off, the pills scattering on the
desk.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Shit!

He begins scooping them back into the bottle, his hands
trembling with the effort.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
          (mumbles)
     Put me in this position ... Expose me
     like this.

He downs a couple of pills with the Scotch.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Why don't they just fucking shoot me?

Nixon takes another drink, looks down.

                    SHARP CUT BACK TO:

INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT (1960)

DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE - JOHN F. KENNEDY looking straight at
the camera.  Tanned, impeccable, confident.

          KENNEDY
     I do not think the world can exist in
     the long run half-slave and half-free.
     The real issue before us is how we can
     prevent the balance of power from
     turning against us ... If we sleep too
     long in the sixties, Mr. Khrushchev
     will "bury" us yet ... I think it's
     time America started moving again.

                           DISSOLVE TO:

NIXON does not look well.  His clothes are baggy, and he
has a slight sheen of perspiration around his lower lip.
He seems uncomfortable in his movements, robotic, falsely
aggressive with his raised eyebrows and glaring demeanor.
(The following essences are taken from four debates and
various campaign material; in using a documentary JFK, we
will be cutting around him when off-debate material is
used.)

          NIXON
     ... When it comes to experience, I
     want you to remember I've had 173
     meetings with President Eisenhower,
     and 217 times with the National
     Security Council.  I've attended 163
     Cabinet meetings.  I've visited fifty
     four countries and had discussions
     with thirty-five presidents, nine
     prime ministers, two emperors, and the
     Shah of Iran...

INT. TV STUDIO - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

PAT NIXON, a year older than Dick, watches her champion
through the glass booth.  The "Mona Lisa" of American
politics, she projects deep admiration for, and pride in,
her husband.  But now she appears perturbed by what she's
seeing.

A younger HALDEMAN sits watching the debates on monitors
with HERB KLEIN, press secretary, and OTHERS in the Nixon
circle.  Through the glass we see the CANDIDATES.

MURRAY CHOTINER, campaign manager, overweight and bow-tied,
moves down the row of monitors holding a cigar.  He manages
to drop ashes on an attractive KENNEDY STAFFER.

          CHOTINER
     Excuse me, sweetheart.

As he sits next to Haldeman, Nixon drones on.

          NIXON (ON T.V. MONITOR)
     Let's take hydroelectric power.  In
     our administration, we've built more
     ...

          CHOTINER
          (privately)
     Jesus Christ, has he told them how
     many push-ups he can do yet?  What the
     hell happened to him?

          HALDEMAN
     He just got out of the hospital,
     Murray, and he hasn't taken an hour
     off during the campaign, thanks to
     you.

          CHOTINER
     You could've at least gotten him a
     suit that fit, for Christ's sake, and
     slapped some makeup on him.  He looks
     like a frigging corpse!

          NIXON (T.V.)
     ... When we consider the lineup of the
     world, we find there are 590 million
     people on our side, 800 million on the
     Communist side, and 600 million who
     are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3
     against us ...

          HALDEMAN
     He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it
     was for queers.

JFK's face is on the monitors now.

          CHOTINER
     Kennedy doesn't look like a queer,
     does he?
          (then)
     He looks like a God.

          HALDEMAN
     Murray, it's not a beauty contest.

          CHOTINER
     We better hope not.

          PAT
          (upset)
     What are you doing to him, Murray?
     Look at him -- he's not well.  He
     doesn't have to debate John Kennedy.

          HALDEMAN
     Mrs. Nixon, we didn't ...

          CHOTINER
     Pat, baby, listen, when it comes to
     ...

          PAT
     He can win without doing this.

          KENNEDY (ON TV)
     ... in attacking my resolve, Mr. Nixon
     has carefully avoided mentioning my
     position on Cuba ...

          HALDEMAN
     Oh shoot!  He's going to do it!  Here
     it comes.

          KENNEDY (ON TV)
     ... As a result of administration
     policies, we have seen Cuba go to the
     Communists ... eight jet minutes from
     the coast of Florida!
     Castro's influence will spread through
     all of Latin America.  We must attempt
     to strengthen the democratic anti
     Castro forces in exile.  These
     fighters have had virtually no support
     from our government!

          HALDEMAN
          (whispers to Klein, Chotiner)
     Sonofabitch!  He was briefed by the
     CIA.  He's using it against us!  He
     knows we can't respond.

          CHOTINER
     It's a disgrace.

          MODERATOR
     Mr. Nixon?

Nixon looks, astounded, at JFK.  He fumbles his response.

          NIXON
     I think ... I think ... that's the
     sort of very dangerous and
     irresponsible suggestion that ...
     helping the Cuban exiles who oppose
     Castro would, uh ... not only be a
     violation of international law, it
     would be ...

          HALDEMAN
          (closes his eyes)
     He's treading water.  Don't mention
     Khrushchev.

          NIXON
     ... an open invitation for Mr.
     Khrushchev to become involved in Latin
     America.  We would lose all our
     friends in Latin America.

          KLEIN
     He just violated national security,
     Dick!  Attack the bastard!

          KENNEDY
     I, for one, have never believed the
     foreign policy of the United States
     should be dictated by the Kremlin.  As
     long as ...

Klein hangs his head; Chotiner shares a look with Haldeman.

The young Kennedy staffers applaud gleefully.

          NIXON (V.O.)
     The sonofabitch stole it!

INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - SUITE - LOS ANGELES - DAWN (1960)

NIXON stands at the center of a room crowded with his MEN.
He is despondent, astounded.  PAT NIXON watches silently,
bitter, nearly in tears.

          CHOTINER
     He carried every cemetery in Chicago!
     And Texas -- they had the goddamned
     cattle voting!

The final ELECTION FIGURES are coming in over the
television.  They show Kennedy with a 120,000-voter margin
(34.2 to 34.1 million) and run down the electoral college
votes.

          CHOTINER (CONT'D)
     Closest election in history, Dick, and
     they stole it.  Sonofabitch!

          NIXON
     He outspent us and he still cheated.
     A guy who's got everything.  I can't
     believe it.  We came to Congress
     together.  I went to his wedding.  We
     were like brothers, for Christ's sake.

Pat leaves abruptly; she can't take it anymore.  Chotiner
looks at Dick as if he were incredibly naive.  HALDEMAN and
KLEIN are at a table, reams of returns before them.

          KLEIN
     We've got the figures, Dick!  The
     fraud is obvious -- we call for a
     recount.

          HALDEMAN
     Nobody's ever contested a presidential
     election.

          CHOTINER
     Who's going to do the counting?  The
     Democrats control Texas, they control
     Illinois.

          KLEIN
     We shift 25,000 votes in two states,
     and ...

          CHOTINER
     How long would that take?  Six months?
     A year?

          HALDEMAN
     Meanwhile, what happens to the
     country?

          NIXON
     The bastard!  If I'd called his shot
     on Cuba I would've won.  He made me
     look soft.

          KLEIN
          (reading transcript)
     "I feel sorry for Nixon because he
     does not know who he is, and at each
     stop he has to decide which Nixon he
     is at the moment, which must be very
     exhausting." -- Jack Kennedy.

          CHOTINER
     Bullshit!

The CAMERA is driving in on Nixon building to a rage.
Klein knows how to get to him.

          KLEIN
          (reading)
     "Nixon's a shifty-eyed, goddamn liar.
     If he had to stick to the truth he'd
     have very little to say.  If you vote
     for him you ought to go to hell!" --
     Harry S Truman ... That's what killed
     us, Dick, not Cuba -- the personality
     problem.  Are we gonna let these
     sonofabitch Democrats get away with
     this?

          HALDEMAN
          (sotto voce)
     You know, Herb, it's not the time ...

Nixon in close-up, inner demons moving him.  A brief IMAGE
of something ugly ... in Nixon.  Himself, perhaps, drenched
in blood, or death imagery.

          NIXON
     Goddamn Kennedy!  Goes to Harvard.
     His father hands him everything on a
     silver platter!  All my life they been
     sticking it to me.  Not the right
     clothes, not the right schools, not
     the right family.  And then he steals
     from me!  I have nothing and he
     steals.
          (softly, lethal)
     And he says I have "no class."  And
     they love him for it.  It's not fair,
     Murray, it's not fair.

          CHOTINER
     Dick, you're only forty-seven.  You
     contest this election, you're
     finished.  You gotta swallow this one.
     They stole it fair and square.

Nixon looks at him, broken-hearted.  He controls his
reaction, and exits the room.

          CHOTINER (CONT'D)
     We'll get 'em next time, Dick.

          KLEIN
     What makes you think there's gonna be
     a next time, Murray?

Chotiner picks up the corner of a campaign poster with
Nixon's face on it, the name in bold below.

          CHOTINER
     Because if he's not President Nixon,
     he's nobody.

INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - CORRIDOR & SUITE - DAWN

NIXON crosses the corridor which is subdued in the morning
light.  He hesitates at the door, knocks softly.

PAT NIXON stirs quietly as her husband walks to her bed.
They occupy separate beds.

          NIXON
     We lost ...

          PAT
          (bitterly)
     I know ...

          NIXON
     It's hard to lose ...

She reaches out to touch him.  He allows himself to be
touched.  It seems that, between them, intimacy is
difficult.

          PAT
     It makes us human ...

          NIXON
     It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the
     insults; I can take the name-calling.
     But I can't take the losing.  I hate
     it.

          PAT
     We don't have to put ourselves through
     this again, Dick.

          NIXON
     What do you mean?  We worked for it.
     We earned it.  It's ours.

          PAT
     It is.  We know that.
          (then)
     And it's enough that we know.  Just
     think of the girls.  They're still
     young.  We never see them.  I lost my
     parents.  I don't want them to lose
     theirs; I don't want them to grow up
     without a mother and father ...

          NIXON
     Maybe I should get out of the game.
     What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to
     being a lawyer and end up with
     something solid, some money at the end
     of the line ... You know, I keep
     thinking of my old man tonight.  He
     was a failure, too.

          PAT
     You're not a failure, Dick.

          NIXON
     You know how much money he had in the
     bank when he died?
          (beat)
     Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...
          (then)
     But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of
     a lot.

He seems about to cry.  Pat reaches out and cradles his
head on her shoulder.  On his eyes we:

EXT. NIXON GROCERY STORE - DUSK (1925)

A few gas pumps in front, overlooking a dry, western,
Edward Hopper landscape.  A run-down residence at the back.
A large man in bloody butcher's apron, FRANK NIXON (46),
crosses.

INT. NIXON GROCERY STORE - DUSK

HAROLD (16), tall, handsome, walks in whistling.  He winks
at RICHARD (12), who is sorting fruit in the bins.  HANNAH
(39), a dour but gracious Quaker woman, is behind the
counter with a CUSTOMER.

          RICHARD
          (whispers)
     What'd he say?

          HAROLD
     What do you think?  He said in life
     there's no free ride.

          RICHARD
     What'd you say?

          HAROLD
     I said I didn't need a free ride.
          (flashes a smile)
     I need a suit.

Richard buries his face in his hands.

          RICHARD
     Oh, no, Harold.  He doesn't respond
     well to humor.
          (looks at his mother,
           worried)
     Maybe if you talk to Mother she can
     ...

          HAROLD
     I'd rather get a whipping than have
     another talk with her.  Anything but a
     talk with her.

Richard is terrified Mom might overhear.

          RICHARD
     Shhhh!

But it's too late.  Hannah looks over, very sharp, as her
customer departs.

          HANNAH
     Richard ... come with me, would you
     ...

          RICHARD
          (surprised, aloud)
     Why me?

INT. NIXON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK

RICHARD, obediently seated, pays his Mother heed.  He seems
a gloomy, unsmiling child in her presence.  We sense that
this is familiar territory for both.  HANNAH, very quiet,
penetrating with her gaze.

          HANNAH
     Because Harold tests thy father's will
     is no reason to admire him.  Let
     Harold's worldliness be a warning to
     thee, not an example.

          RICHARD
     Yes, Mother ...

          HANNAH
     Harold may have lost touch with his
     Bible, but thou must never lapse.

Then, she extends her hand.

          HANNAH (CONT'D)
     Now, give it to me ...

Richard is about to plead ignorance.

          HANNAH (CONT'D)
     Do not tell a lie, Richard ... The
     cornsilk cigarette Harold gave thee
     behind the store this morning.

          RICHARD
          (lying)
     I don't ... have them.  Mother ... I
     swear, I ... didn't smoke.

          HANNAH
          (withdrawing)
     I see ... Well then, Richard, we have
     nothing more to talk about, do we?

          RICHARD
          (fearful, blurts out)
     Please, Mother, it ... it was just one
     time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.

          HANNAH
     So am I.  Thy father will have to know
     of thy lying.

          RICHARD
          (terrified)
     No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell
     him.  I'll never do it again.  I
     promise.  I promise ...
          (on the edge of tears)
     Please, mama ...

          HANNAH
          (pause)
     I expect more from thee, Richard.

He buries his head in her skirt.  The faintest smile on
Hannah's face as she pockets the cigarette.

          RICHARD
     Please!  I'll never let you down
     again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.

          HANNAH
     Then this shall be our little secret.
          (She lifts his face to hers)
     Remember that I see into thy soul as
     God sees.  Thou may fool the world.
     Even thy father.  But not me, Richard.
     Never me.

          RICHARD
     Mother, think of me always as your
     faithful dog ...

INT. NIXON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

HANNAH puts the food on the table as FRANK NIXON, sleeves
rolled up, waits at the head of the table, fuming.  ARTHUR
(6) and DONALD (9) join RICHARD and HAROLD.  (The fifth
brother, Edward, has not yet been born.)  Harold reaches
for a dish.

          FRANK
     Don't you dare, Harold!

          HAROLD
          (a little laugh)
     I just thought, since the food was
     here ...

          HANNAH
     We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.

          RICHARD
          (nervously)
     Is it my turn?

Hannah nods.  Richard puts his hands together, trying to
please.

          RICHARD (CONT'D)
     Heavenly Father, we humbly thank--

          FRANK
          (interrupts)
     I'll do it.  There's a coupla things I
     wanna say.

          HANNAH
     Could thou at least remove thy apron,
     Frank?

          FRANK
     This blood pays the bills, Hannah.
     I'm not ashamed of how I earn my
     money.
          (clears his throat)
     Heavenly Father, you told Adam in the
     Garden, after that business with the
     snake, that man would have to earn his
     way by the sweat of his face.  Well,
     as far as I can tell, Father, what was
     true in Eden is true in Whittier,
     California.  So we ask you now to
     remind certain of our young people ...
          (glares at Harold)
     ... that the only way to get a new
     suit to go to the promenade with
     Margaret O'Herlihy, who happens to be
     a Catholic by the way, is to work for
     it.
          (then)
     Amen.

          ARTHUR
     I like Margaret O'Herlihy, too.  She's
     very pretty.  Can we pray now?

The boys start giggling.

          HANNAH
     Arthur!

          FRANK
     You think this is funny?
          (then)
     Pretty soon you boys are gonna have to
     get out there and scratch, 'cause
     you're not gonna get anywhere on your
     good looks.  Just ask those fellas ...

Frank waves to the Hobos, now squatting and wolfing down
the food.  They look up, embarrassed.

          FRANK (CONT'D)
     Charity is only gonna get you so far --
     even with saints like your mother
     around.  Struggle's what gives life
     meaning, not victory.  Struggle.  When
     you quit struggling, they've beaten
     you, and then you end up in the street
     with your hand out.

Frank begins eating; the rest follow.

          NIXON (V.O.)
     My mother was a saint, but my old man
     struggled his whole life.  You could
     call him a little man, a poor man, but
     they never beat him.  I always tried
     to remember that when things didn't go
     my way...

EXT. WHITTIER FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY (1932)

FOOTBALL MONTAGE: RICHARD (19), 150 pounds, is on the
defensive line as the ball is hiked.  ("Let's get fired
up!")  He gets creamed by a 200-pound offensive tackle.  He
jumps up, no face guard, hurting, and resets.  AD LIB
football chatter.  We can tell from Richard's cheap uniform
that he is a substitute.  But:

We go again.  And again.  Building a special RHYTHM of JUMP
CUTS showing Nixon getting mauled each time.  He doesn't
have a chance, this kid, but he has pluck.  And he comes
back for more.  And more.

This image of pain and humiliation should weave itself in
and out of the film in repetitive currents.  As we

OMIT SCENE #19

INT. HILTON HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT (1962)

We move down past a blizzard of balloons and confetti blown
by a hotel air-conditioner to a huge "NIXON FOR GOVERNOR"
banner.

NIXON thrusts his arms in the air -- the twin-V salute.
The CROWD cheer wildly.  SUBTITLE READS: "CALIFORNIA
GOVERNORSHIP, 1962."

INT. HILTON HOTEL - SUITE - NIGHT

NIXON is slumped in an armchair, feet on a coffee table,
holding a drink, going through defeat once again.

HALDEMAN stares glumly at the TV.  PAT sits across the room
in grim silence.

ON TV - a NEWSCASTER stands in front of a tally board with
the network logo: "Decision '62."

          NEWSCASTER
     President Kennedy has called Governor
     Pat Brown to congratulate him...

          HALDEMAN
     Are we making a statement?

          NEWSCASTER
     ABC is now projecting that Brown will
     defeat Richard Nixon by more than a
     quarter of a million votes.

Nixon holds up his drink to the screen.  Moves to a piano.

          NIXON
     Thank you, Fidel Castro.

          PAT
     You're not going to blame this on
     Castro, are you?

          NIXON
     I sure am.  The goddamned missile
     crisis united the whole country behind
     Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown.
     People were scared, that's why.

          PAT
     I suppose Castro staged the whole
     thing just to beat you.

          NIXON
     Buddy, before you join the jubilation
     at my being beaten again, you should
     remember: People vote not out of love,
     but fear.  They don't teach that at
     Sunday School or at the Whittier
     Community Playhouse!

          HALDEMAN
          (interjects)
     I should go down and check in with our
     people.

Haldeman leaves quickly.

ON TV - GOVERNOR BROWN steps to the podium.  A band plays
"Happy Days Are Here Again."

          PAT
          (back at Dick)
     I'm glad they don't.  You forget I had
     a life before California, a rough,
     rough life.  Life isn't always fair,
     Dick...

Nixon drowns her out, playing the piano (well) and singing
along bitterly.

          NIXON
     "--the skies above are clear again.
     Let's sing a song of cheer again--"...
     Cocksucker!

Pat turns off the TV.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
          (continues to play)
     Don't you want to listen to Brown's
     victory speech?

          PAT
     No.  I'm not going to listen to any
     more speeches ever again.

          NIXON
     Amen to that.

          PAT
     It's over, Dick.

          NIXON
     I'll concede in the morning.

          PAT
     Not that.
          (then)
     Us.

Nixon stops playing, looks at her.

          PAT (CONT'D)
          (coldly)
     I've always stood by you.  I
     campaigned for you when I was
     pregnant.  During Checkers, when Ike
     wanted you out, I told you to fight.
     This is different, Dick.  You've
     changed.  You've grown more ...
     bitter, like you're at war with the
     world.  You weren't that way before.
     You scare me sometimes... I'm fifty
     years old now, Dick.  How many
     people's hands have I shaken -- people
     I didn't like, people I didn't even
     know.  It's as if, I don't know, I
     went to sleep along time ago and
     missed the years between... I've had
     enough.

He moves toward her awkwardly.  Pat struggles.  She goes to
a window, her back to him.  She is not one to enjoy
"scenes."  She tends to accommodate to others to preserve
an aura of happiness.

          NIXON
          (confused)
     What are you saying?  What are you
     talking about?

          PAT
     I want a divorce.

          NIXON
     My God -- divorce?
          (beat)
     What about the girls?

          PAT
     The girls will grow up.  They only
     know you from television anyway.

          NIXON
     It would ruin us, Buddy, our family.

          PAT
     You're ruining us.  If we stay with
     you, you'll take us down with you.
          (beat)
     This isn't political, Dick.  This is
     our life.

          NIXON
     Everything's political, for Christ's
     sake!  I'm political.  And you're
     political, too!

          PAT
     No, I'm not!  I'm finished.

She is very serious.  He sees it.  It terrifies him.  The
same withdrawal he experienced from his mother.

          NIXON
     This is just what they want, Buddy.
     Don't you see it?  They want to drive
     us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let
     them do it.  We've been through too
     much together, Buddy ... We belong
     together.

          PAT
          (ironic)
     That's what you said the first time we
     met.  You didn't even know me.

MARRIAGE MONTAGE: During this scene we have a series of
SHOTS of their courtship -- the Whittier College campus,
1930s Los Angeles; driving in a car together; the wedding;
the FIRST CHILD; the Pacific NAVAL CAPTAIN underneath a
palm tree; running as a first-time CONGRESSMAN with Pat;
the EISENHOWER years...

          NIXON
          (very tender)
     Oh, yes, I did.  I told you I was
     gonna marry you, didn't I?  On the
     first date ... I said it because I
     knew ... I knew you were the one ...
     so solid and so strong ... and so
     beautiful.  You were the most
     beautiful thing I'd ever seen ... I
     don't want to lose you, Buddy, ever...

INTERCUT WITH:

Nixon seeking tenderness.  He puts a hand on her arm.  He
tries gently to pull her towards him, to kiss her.

          PAT
     Dick, don't...

          NIXON
     Buddy, look at me ... just look at me.
     Do you really want me to quit?

She stares out the window.  A long moment.

          PAT
     We can be happy.  We really can.  We
     love you, Dick.  The girls and I...

          NIXON
     If I stop ... there'll be no more talk
     of divorce?

A long moment.  She finally turns her eyes to him,
assenting.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     I'll do it.
          (waves his hand)
     No more.

          PAT
     Are you serious?

          NIXON
     Yeah ... I'm out.

          PAT
     Is that the truth?

          NIXON
     I'll never run again.  I promise.

                          SHARP CUT TO:

INT. HILTON HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

NIXON stalks down the hallway, fuming.  HALDEMAN walks
alongside.

          NIXON
     Where are they?

          HALDEMAN
          (worried, points to a door)
     Dick, you don't have to make a
     statement.  Herb covered it for you.

          NIXON
     No!

He bursts through the door into:

INT. HILTON HOTEL - PRESS CONFERENCE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

A noisy CROWD of REPORTERS reacts, excitedly, to NIXON'S
fast entry.  The smell of blood is in the air.

                           TIME CUT TO:

NIXON at the podium

          NIXON
     ... I believe Governor Brown has a
     heart, even though he believes I do
     not.  I believe he is a good American,
     even though he feels I am not.  I am
     proud of the fact that I defended my
     opponent's patriotism; you gentlemen
     didn't report it but I am proud I did
     that.  And I would appreciate it, for
     once, gentlemen, if you would write
     what I say.
          (time dissolve)
     ... For sixteen years, ever since the
     Hiss case, you've had a lot of fun --
     a lot of fun.  But recognize you have
     a responsibility, if you're against a
     candidate, to give him the shaft, but
     if you do that, at least put one
     lonely reporter on the campaign who
     will report what the candidate says
     now and then...

HALDEMAN glances at KLEIN.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     ... I think all-in-all I've given as
     good as I've taken.  But as I leave
     you I want you to know -- just think
     how much you're going to be missing:
     you won't have Nixon to kick around
     anymore.  Because, gentlemen, this is
     my last press conference...

A FEW REPORTERS shout questions.  There is a loud
confusion, but Nixon has vanished.

          KLEIN
     What the hell was that?

          HALDEMAN
          (beat)
     Suicide.

                          CUT TO:

NIXON HISTORICAL MONTAGE:

A grainy "NEWSREEL" treats NIXON as political history, now
over.  The ANONYMOUS REPORTERS return -- YOUNG NIXON, in
his Navy uniform, is campaigning in California in the 1940s
against Voorhis and Douglas.

          REPORTER 1 (V.O.)
     We can now officially write the
     political obituary of Richard Milhouse
     Nixon ... He came into being as part
     of the big post-war 1946 Republican
     sweep of the elections.  People were
     weary of the New Deal and FDR's big
     government ...

Images of FDR, TRUMAN, and ACHESON, early Cold War imagery
- the Soviets, Berlin.

          REPORTER 1 (V.O.) (CONT'D)
     ... The United States had been a
     strong ally of the Soviet Union, which
     had lost more than twenty million
     people in its fight against Nazism.
     But Nixon, coming from the South
     Pacific war, won his first term in the
     House by freely associating his
     liberal opponent, Jerry Voorhis, with
     Communism.

Images of Voorhis, Hoover ... NIXON working a CROWD,
standing on the tailgate of his station-wagon, debating
Voorhis.

          REPORTER 2 (V.O.)
     For Nixon, politics was war.  He
     didn't have opponents, he had enemies.
     He didn't run against people, he
     ruined them ... He won his California
     seat in the U.S. Senate in 1950 in a
     vicious campaign against liberal
     congresswoman and movie actress, Helen
     Gahagan Douglas...

NEWSFILM of NIXON and CHOTINER at a rally with PAT.  Images
of DOUGLAS follow.  CAMPAIGN WORKERS handing out smear
literature.

          NIXON ("NEWSFILM LOOK")
     How can Helen Douglas, capable actress
     that she is, take up so strange a role
     as a foe of Communism?  Why, she's
     pink right down to her underwear ...

          REPORTER 3 (V.O.)
     ... Nixon quickly became the
     Republican's attack dog.
     He tore into Truman for losing
     Mainland China in 1949, and blamed the
     war in Korea on a weak foreign policy
     ... His speeches, if more subtle than
     those of his Republican ally, Joe
     McCarthy, were just as aggressive ...

Nixon at another rally with Pat.

          NIXON ("NEWSFILM LOOK")
     ... I promise to continue to expose
     the people that have sold this country
     down the river!  Until we have driven
     all the crooks and Communists and
     those that have helped them out of
     office!!

Images of Truman, the hydrogen bomb, the Rosenbergs, Klaus
Fuchs, Oppenheimer, the Chinese taking over in 1949 ...
Mao.

          NIXON ("NEWSFILM LOOK") (CONT'D)
     The direct result of Truman's decision
     is that China has gone Communist.  Mao
     is a monster.  Why?!  Why, Mr.
     Acheson?!  Who in the State Department
     is watching over American interests?!
     Who has given the Russians the atomic
     bomb?! ... Today the issue is slavery!
     The Soviet Union is an example of the
     slave state in its ultimate
     development.  Great Britain is halfway
     down the same road; powerful interests
     are striving to impose the British
     socialist system upon the people of
     the United States!

          REPORTER 2 (V.O.)
     ... Nixon became one of the leading
     lights of the notorious House Un
     American Activities Committee,
     questioning labor leaders, Spanish
     Civil War veterans, Hollywood
     celebrities ...

          NIXON ("NEWSFILM LOOK")
          (questioning witness)
     Can you tell me today the names of any
     pictures which Hollywood has made in
     the last five years showing the evils
     of totaliarian Communism?

NIXON surrounded by REPORTERS outside the HUAC hearing
room.

          REPORTER 4 (V.O.)
     ... but it was the Alger Hiss case
     that made Nixon a household name ...

IMAGES of Alger Hiss's career: clerking for Oliver Wendell
Holmes; with FDR at Yalta, with Churchill, with Stalin.

          REPORTER 4 (V.O.) (CONT'D)
     ... One of the architects of the
     United Nations, intimate with FDR and
     Oliver Wendell Holmes, Alger Hiss was
     a darling of the liberals.
          (then)
     But Whittaker Chambers, a former
     freelance journalist, said he was a
     Communist.

WHITTAKER CHAMBERS testifying before the HUAC.

          CHAMBERS (TV INTERVIEW)
     ... If the American people understood
     the real character of Alger Hiss, they
     would boil him in oil ...

          REPORTER 4 (V.O.)
     ... Hiss claimed he was being set up
     by Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover to
     discredit the New Deal's policies.
     The case came down to an Underwood
     typewriter, and a roll of film hidden
     in a pumpkin patch.

DOCUMENTARY IMAGE - A DETECTIVE-TYPE reaches into a
hollowed-out pumpkin and pulls out microfilm.  In his
congressional office, NIXON examines the film with a
magnifying glass, playing to the cameras with a deadly
serious mien ... Shots of MRS. HISS, the Underwood
typewriter.

          REPORTER 4 (V.O.) (CONT'D)
     ... Years later the Freedom of
     Information Act revealed that the film
     showed a report on business conditions
     in Manchuria, and fire extinguishers
     on a U.S. destroyer.  None of these
     documents were classified.  Were they
     planted by Chambers, who seemed to
     have a strange, almost psychotic
     fixation with Alger Hiss?

NIXON points to a headline -- "HISS CONVICTED."

          REPORTER 1 (V.O.)
     After two confusing trials, Hiss went
     to jail for perjury.  To the right
     wing, Nixon was a hero and a patriot.
     To the liberals, he was a shameless
     self-promoter who had vengefully
     destroyed a fine man.  Eleanor
     Roosevelt angrily condemned him.
     It was to become a pattern: you either
     loved Richard Nixon or hated him.

A brief IMAGE here that will recur through-out the film.
An image of evil -- call it "The Beast."

          REPORTER 2 (V.O.)
     Driven by demons that seemed more
     personal than political, his rise was
     meteoric.  Congressman at 33, senator
     at 35, Eisenhower's vice-presidential
     candidate at 39.  Then came the
     Checkers Crisis ... Nixon was accused
     of hiding a secret slush fund.  About
     to be kicked off the ticket by Ike, he
     went on national television with an
     unprecedented appearance ...

INTERCUT Checkers speech - NIXON, looking and sounding like
Uriah Heep, pleads with the American people on TV, as PAT
sits uncomfortably in an armchair nearby.

          NIXON (ON TV)
     ... so now what I am going to do is
     give this audience a complete
     financial history.  Everything I've
     earned, everything I've spent,
     everything I owe ...

Nixon forces a smile.  Pat is clearly in pain, mortified.

          REPORTER 2 (V.O.)
     The list included their house, their
     Oldsmobile, Pat's Republican cloth
     coat, and lastly, in what was to
     become history -- a sentimental gift
     from a Texas businessman ...

          NIXON (ON TV)
     You know what it was?  It was a little
     cocker spaniel dog.  Black and white
     spotted.  And ... our little girl,
     Tricia, the six-year-old, named it
     "Checkers."  And you know, the kids
     love that dog and we're going to keep
     it ...

          REPORTER 4 (V.O.)
     Fifty-eight million people saw it.  It
     was shameless.  It was manipulative.
          (then)
     It was a huge success!

DOCUMENTARY REPLACEMENT - Nixon with Ike in triumph.  A
clip of Eisenhower praising Nixon.  Nixon and Pat standing
up to rock-throwing STUDENTS in Venezuela.  Pointing his
finger at KHRUSHCHEV in the Kitchen Debate.

          REPORTER 3 (V.O.)
     Eisenhower put Nixon back on the
     ticket ... Responding to attacks on
     Truman, Acheson and the entire
     Democratic Party for betraying the
     American principles in China, Korea
     and elsewhere -- it was two-time
     Democratic presidential candidate,
     Adlai Stevenson, who perhaps best
     summed up the national unease with
     Richard Nixon...

DOCUMENTARY - SHOTS of ADLAI STEVENSON  campaigning in '52
and '56 against IKE.  Images of JOE MCCARTHY precede.  The
HERBLOCK CARTOON of Nixon crawling out of the sewer system.
Others of his cartoons follow.

          STEVENSON (RADIO V.O.)
     ... This is a man of many masks.  Who
     can say they have seen his real face?
     He is on an ill-will tour,
     representing McCarthyism in a white
     collar.  Nixonland has no standard of
     truth but convenience, and no standard
     of morality except sly innuendo, the
     poison pen, the anonymous phone call;
     the land of smash and grab and
     anything to win ... "What, ultimately,
     shall it profit a man if he shall gain
     the whole world and lose his own
     soul?"

Ending with more recent SHOTS of Nixon campaigning in '60
and '62.  As the IMAGES spot out in newsreel style:

          REPORTER 4
     It was a great story of its time and,
     in California where it started, it has
     come crashing to an end.  It is too
     bad in a way, because the truth is, we
     never knew who Richard Nixon really
     was.  And now that he is gone, we
     never will ...

"March of Time"-type music as we

                     SLOWLY FADE INTO:

          NIXON (V.O.)
     "Your father stinks" ... They actually
     said this to Tricia.  Two girls
     wearing Kennedy pins.  At Chapin!

INT. FIFTH AVE APARTMENT - NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT (1963)

A New York cocktail party.  Society DAMES.  Rich,
conservative BUSINESSMEN, platters of martinis and hors
d'oeuvres carried by white-gloved BLACK BUTLERS.  The
fashions are Balenciaga and Courreges, tipping to the
shorter hemlines; the mood is smoky and upbeat, the folks
pressed into airtight packs of loud conversation.

NIXON is talking to JOHN MITCHELL (54), his wife MARTHA
(40's), and TWO OTHER ASSOCIATES of the law firm he has
joined.

          NIXON
          (anguished)
     She was crying when she came home.
          (shakes his head)
     She was devastated.

          MARTHA
     Poor little Tricia.  Well, that's New
     York -- makes for a tougher animal
     later in life.

          NIXON
          (to the other lawyers)
     I told her, her daddy couldn't even
     get a goddamned job in this city when
     I got out of Duke.  Every white-shoe
     lawyer firm turned me down.  Didn't
     have the right "look."  Hell, I
     couldn't even get into the FBI.

          MITCHELL
          (indicating)
     Dick, we should catch Rocky 'fore he
     leaves.

NELSON ROCKEFELLER, Governor of New York, dominates the
room.  Big smile, horn-rimmed glasses.  Next to him is
HAPPY, his new wife, much younger.

          NIXON
          (glancing)
     Well, he can walk in this direction,
     too.

          MARTHA
     Did you catch that picture of you in
     Newsweek last week, Dick?  You were
     standing in a crowd on Fifth Avenue,
     and you were looking straight ahead,
     and everyone else was looking the
     other way like you'd just farted or
     something.
          (laughs)
     It said: "Who Remembers Dick Nixon?"
     I was screaming.  It was so funny!

          NIXON
     Yeah, that was hilarious, Martha.
          (for the others)
     They were all looking the other way
     'cause they were waiting for the light
     to change.  I called AP on that --
     typical of the press in this country,
     they wouldn't correct it.  That or
     they print the retraction right next
     to the girdle ads.

          LAWYER
     Oh, I've read some very nice things
     about you.

          MARTHA
          (puts her hand on Nixon's
           arm)
     Maybe where you come from.  But where
     I come from, Dick Nixon is as
     misunderstood as a fox in a henhouse.
     And you know why?
          (they all wait)
     Because, honey, they all think your
     smile and your face are never in the
     same place at the same time.

Nervous laughter.

          MARTHA (CONT'D)
     You and me -- we gotta work on that,
     sweetie...

          MITCHELL
          (guiding Dick away)
     Someone freshen Martha's drink.  I
     think she's down a quart.

          MARTHA
     Well, zippety-fucking-doo-dah!

Mitchell moves Nixon away towards the Rockefeller GROUP.

          MITCHELL
     Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.

          NIXON
     You mean smashed!  She called up at
     midnight last week.  Talking a bunch
     of crap.  Pat can't stand her.

          MITCHELL
     It's a thing she does.  She talks at
     night.

          NIXON
     Talks all day, too!  How the hell can
     you put up with her, John?

          MITCHELL
          (sheepishly)
     What the hell -- I love her.  And
     she's great in bed.

Rockefeller holds court, not immediately noticing Nixon.

          ROCKEFELLER
     ... There are no guarantees in
     politics.  I'm going to roll the dice
     with everyone else.

HENRY KISSINGER (40's), intense, holds a martini.

          KISSINGER
     Well, if a Rockefeller can't become
     President of the United States, what's
     the point of democracy?

Laughter.

          NIXON
     The point of democracy is that even
     the son of a grocer can become
     president.

Laughs.

          ROCKEFELLER
     And you came damn close, too, Dick.

As Rocky clutches Dick, who doesn't like to be touched:

          ROCKEFELLER (CONT'D)
     Howya doin'!  New York treating you
     okay?  I'm sorry I haven't been able
     to see you at all--

          NIXON
          (cutting off the apology)
     Well enough.  You're looking "happy,"
     Nelson.

With a look to Happy.

          ROCKEFELLER
     Oh, Happy!
          (introduces his new wife)
     Dick Nixon ... You remember him.

          NIXON
     Hi, Happy.  Well, you're obviously
     making him happy.

          ROCKEFELLER
     Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I
     feel ten years younger!  It makes a
     helluva difference, let me tell ya!
     How's the lawyer life?

          NIXON
     Never made so much money in my life.
     But my upbringing doesn't allow me to
     enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case
     before the Supreme Court.

          ROCKEFELLER
     Won or lost?

          NIXON
     Lost.

          ROCKEFELLER
     Someday, Dick.

OTHERS are pressing in on Rockefeller, who is obviously the
"star" of the party, so there is pressure to talk fast.

          NIXON
     But being out of the game gives me
     time to write.

          ROCKEFELLER
     To what?

          NIXON
     Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling
     it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing,
     Rocky -- take some time off to write.

          ROCKEFELLER
          (shaking another hand)
     Hiya, fellow ... What were they?

          NIXON
     What?

          ROCKEFELLER
     The "crises"?

          NIXON
     "Checkers" of course, Hiss, Ike's
     heart attack, Venezuela, the Kitchen
     Debate, and Kennedy.

          ROCKEFELLER
     Sounds like you got a crisis syndrome.
     Aren't you exaggerating a bit, Dick?
     Call it three-and-a-half, maybe four
     ...

          NIXON
          (laughs awkwardly)
     Let's wait and see how you survive
     your first crisis, Rocky ...

          ROCKEFELLER
     Whatcha mean by that?

          NIXON
     You know: how the voters are gonna
     play your divorce.

Rockefeller, who still clutches the visibly uncomfortable
Nixon, gives him a squeeze before finally releasing him.

          ROCKEFELLER
     Don't you worry about it, fella, and I
     won't.

About to rejoin his wife.

          NIXON
     Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send
     you my book.  "Six Crises."

          ROCKEFELLER
     Whatcha predicting -- your boy
     Goldwater going to split the party?

          NIXON
     Some say you are, Rocky.

          ROCKEFELLER
     The Republican Party was never home to
     extremists.  You should know better.
     This guy's as stupid as McCarthy, and
     McCarthy never did you any good in the
     long run, now did he?

A pause.  It lands home on Dick.  Rockefeller turns to
Kissinger, who's been listening.

          ROCKEFELLER (CONT'D)
     Hey, you know Henry Kissinger -- he's
     down from Harvard.  On my staff,
     foreign policy whiz ...

          NIXON
          (shakes hands)
     No, but I liked your book on nuclear
     weapons.  We have similar views on the
     balance of power ...

          ROCKEFELLER
     Well, that's wonderful.  So get me
     this "crisis" thing, Dick; I'll be
     glad to take a look at it.

He raps Nixon one more time on the shoulder and moves of
into a waiting GROUP.

          NIXON
     ... as the old alliances crumble.

          KISSINGER
     Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a
     great admirer of yours, too, Mr.
     Nixon.  You are an unusual politician.
     We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises"
     sounds like a page from Churchill.

          NIXON
     Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They
     all went through the pain of losing
     power.

          KISSINGER
          (smiles)
     But they all got it back again, didn't
     they?
          (proffering a card)
     We should have lunch sometime.

                              TIME CUT:

NIXON and MITCHELL move to the edges of the PARTY, which is
now diminishing.  They bypass PAT, who is absently staring
off in conversation with MARTHA and SEVERAL OTHER LADIES
who lunch ... Nixon looks back at ROCKEFELLER leaving --
KISSINGER hovering near him.

          NIXON
          (seething)
     Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's
     going to get nominated west of the
     Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be
     drinking Scotches in retirement at
     some goddamn country club with the
     rest of the Republicans.

          MITCHELL
     Goes to show you all the moolah in the
     world can't buy you a brain.

          NIXON
          (snags a drink from a passing
           tray)
     Well, he seems to have bought
     Kissinger.

          MITCHELL
     The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the
     morals of an eel -- sells himself to
     the highest bidder.

          NIXON
          (brays loudly)
     You're the one who should be in
     politics, John.  You're tougher than I
     am.  You never crack.

          MITCHELL
     That'll be the day.

          NIXON
     Let's get out of here; it's too
     painful.  I hate it.
          (then)
     We went bowling last weekend.  Next
     weekend we're going to the zoo.
     Whoever said there was life after
     politics was full of shit.

          MITCHELL
     Make some money, Dick, prove yourself
     to the Wall Street crowd and let
     Goldwater and Rockefeller take the
     fall against Kennedy.

Nixon looks at him.

          NIXON
     Yeah.  John, I'm in hell.
          (then)
     I'll be mentally dead in two years and
     physically dead in four.  I miss -- I
     don't know -- making love to the
     people.  I miss -- entering a room.  I
     miss -- the pure "acting" of it.
     John, I've got to get back in the
     arena.

On Pat glancing over:

                          CUT TO:

INT. DALLAS CONVENTION SITE - DAY (1963)

SPOTLIGHT on a sexy Studebaker car of the era.  A DRUM
ROLL, and suddenly out of the various apertures of the car
pop six half-naked HOSTESSES doing the twist.  Wild cheers.

The ANNOUNCER describes the new gimmicks on the car (AD
LIB) as we swing to reveal NIXON, looking uncomfortable in
a Stetson cowboy hat shaking hands with AUTOGRAPH SEEKERS
and car buffs, posing for cheese-cake photographs.  A
banner behind him reveals: "Dallas Welcomes Studebaker
Dealers."

The Studebaker GIRLS are fanning out through the sales
booths, whistling, swinging whips, as a large man in a
Stetson, JACK JONES, accompanied by a suave-looking Cuban
born businessman, TRINI CARDOZA, breaks through the
autograph hounds to rescue Nixon.

          JONES
     That's enough now, let him be.  He's
     just like you and me, folks, just
     another lawyer ... Let's go, let's go,
     break it up ...

Moving Nixon out of there.

          NIXON
     Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a
     helluva party.

          JONES
     Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got
     these gals coming over to the ranch
     later for a little private "thing,"
     y'know ... There's some fellows I want
     you to meet.

          NIXON
     Well, uh, Trini and I have an early
     plane.  We were hoping to get back to
     New York in time for ...

          TRINI
     It'll be okay, Dick; these guys are
     interesting ... real quiet.  And the
     girls are, too.

          JONES
     Y'know, it's not every day we Texans
     get to entertain the future President
     of the United States.

          NIXON
     Like you said Jack, I'm just a New
     York lawyer now.

          JONES
          (chuckles, with a look to
           Trini)
     We'll see about that.

New FANS circle up, their WIVES giggling.

          FANS
     Oh, Mr. Nixon could you sign ...?  My
     wife and I think you are just the
     greatest.  Please run again ...

More fans flood in, circling him.  On Trini and Jack
watching this.

EXT. JONES RANCH - DAY

An entire LONGHORN STEER turns on a spit in a large
barbecue pit, basted by black SERVANTS.  We see a sprawling
Spanish-style RANCH HOUSE in the countryside.  The parking
area looks like a Cadillac dealership.  The CROWD is a
mixture of CORPORATE EXECUTIVES, CUBANS, and COWBOY-TYPES,
some WIVES.

TRINI is talking to TWO of the DANCERS, nodding his head in
NIXON'S direction.  They look, and smile at him.

Across the lawn, Nixon smiles back awkwardly as JACK JONES
nudges him.  They both eat steaks and corncobs.

          JONES
     I know for a fact that the one with
     the big tits is a Republican, and
     she'd do anything for the Party.

          NIXON
     She's quite pretty.

          JONES
     Her name's Sandy ...

Trini joins them, bringing the girls.

          NIXON
     By the way, Jack, this looks like a
     pretty straight-forward transaction to
     me, but we should get into it soon --
     just take a few minutes, maybe up at
     the house ...

          JONES
          (to Trini, coming up)
     He's all business, ain't he, Trini?
          (to Dick)
     Dick, we could've had our own goddamn
     lawyers handle this deal.  We brought
     you down here 'cause we wanted to talk
     to you ...

          TRINI
     Dick, this is Teresa, and this is
     Sandy.

          TERESA
     Hi ... Dick.

          SANDY
     Hi.

          NIXON
     Hello ...

Pause.

INT. JONES RANCH - DAY

A walk-in stone fireplace dominates the room; the heavy
beams hung with black wrought-iron candelabras.  Thick
cigar smoke impregnates the air; the crowd has
substantially thinned to the heaviest hitters.  The MEN,
now in shirt-sleeves, drink from bottles of bourbon.

A man -- MITCH -- emerges from one of the side rooms with a
DANCER.

Off to the side in a semi-private alcove, SANDY, the
dancer, tries to make conversation, but NIXON is showing
her pictures of his kids.

          NIXON
     That's Julie ... and that's Tricia.
     She, uh, reminds me a little bit of
     you ...

          SANDY
          ("interested")
     Oh yeah ... she really is ...
     wholesome.

Trini interjects, trying to help out.

          TRINI
     So what's up?  ... Uh, I get the
     feeling Sandy really likes you, Dick.

          SANDY
     I like that name, Dick.

          TRINI
     Why don't you two disappear in the
     bedroom in there.  Come back in half
     an hour ...

          NIXON
     Uh ... Trini.

Trini smiles and, leaving Dick the playing field, vanishes.
Sandy, feeling the vacuum, holds Nixon's hand.

          SANDY
     What do you say?  Do you like me,
     Mister Vice President?

Nixon swallows hard, blushing now.  He sweats, very
uncomfortable with this intimacy.

          NIXON
          (croaks)
     Yes, of course.  But ... uh ...

A brief IMAGE flashes by -- beastlike, offensive, unworthy.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     ... I don't really know you yet, Sandy
     ... What do you like?  I mean, what
     kind of clothes do you like?  Do you
     like blue ... red?

          SANDY
     Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...

          NIXON
     What kind of, uh ... music do you
     like?

          SANDY
     I like jazz ...

          NIXON
     Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...

          SANDY
     Elvis I like, too.

          NIXON
     Oh yeah, he's good.

Sandy puts her hands on his face and head.

          SANDY
     ... but it depends on what I'm doing
     to the music, Dick ...

          NIXON
     Uh, is your mother ... still alive?

          SANDY
     Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...

          NIXON
     She must be very attractive.  Would
     she like an autograph?  She might
     remember me ... Where's Trini?

Looking around desperately.

                           TIME CUT TO:

INT. JONES RANCH - DAY

Later.  The crowd has thinned further to a hard-core dozen.
The last man -- Mitch -- comes from the inner bedrooms,
zipping up, the Servants chasing out the straggling girls.
Another round of drinks is served.  The cigars are out.

          JONES
     Hell, Kennedy's pissed Cuba away to
     the Russians.  And he don't know what
     the hell he's doing in Vietnam.  These
     are dangerous times, Dick, especially
     for business ...

          NIXON
     Agreed.

A CUBAN in an Italian suit, one part sleazy, another part
dangerous, steps from the shadows.

          CUBAN
     We know what you tried to do for Cuba,
     Mr. Nixon.  If you'd been elected
     president in '60, we know Castro'd be
     dead by now.

NIXON shares a look with TRINI.

          NIXON
     Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to
     go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made
     his decision.  I appreciate your
     sentiments.  I've heard them from many
     fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing
     I can do anything about.  Now, it's a
     long drive back to Dallas tonight, and
     Trini and I have got an early flight
     tomorrow to New York ...

          JONES
          (interrupting)
     Dick, these boys want you to run.
          (the "boys" mutter in unison)
     They're serious.  They can deliver the
     South and they can put Texas in your
     column.  That would've done it in '60.

          NIXON
     Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.

          JONES
     That sonofabitch Kennedy is coming
     back down here tomorrow.  Dick, we're
     willing to put up a shitpot fulla
     money to get rid of him -- more
     money'n you ever dreamed of.

          NIXON
     Nobody's gonna beat Kennedy in '64
     with all the money in the world.

A beat.

          CUBAN
     Suppose Kennedy don't run in '64?

Nixon looks at him.  A subconscious IMAGE again --
something slimy, reptilian.

          NIXON
     Not a chance.

          CUBAN
     These are dangerous times, Mr. Nixon.
     Anything can happen.

Another pause.  Nixon gathers together his papers and
briefcase.

          NIXON
     Yes, well ... Gentlemen, I promised my
     wife.  I'm out of politics.

          MITCH
          (insolent smile)
     You just came down here for the
     weather, right, Mr. Nixon?

          NIXON
     I came down here to close a deal for
     Studebaker.

          TRINI
     What about '68, Dick?

          NIXON
     Five years, Trini?  In politics,
     that's an eternity.

          JONES
     Your country needs you, Dick.

Nixon shakes his hand, departs.

          NIXON
     Unfortunately, my country isn't
     available right now.

EXT. LOVE FIELD - DAY (1963)

A CROWD is waiting for Air Force One.  People hold banners,
signs: "Dallas Loves JFK," "We Love You Jackie."

A Cadillac pulls up at the far corner of the tarmac.  NIXON
gets out with CARDOZA.  They walk toward a small executive
PLANE.

Nixon pauses, looks up.  He feels something ominous in the
air.

          NIXON
     Trini, let's get out of here fast.  Go
     check on the pilot, or they'll hold us
     up till he's out of the airport.

As Trini hurries off to the plane, Nixon takes one last
look up at his fate written in the soft white clouds over
Dallas.  As we:

                          CUT TO:

DOCUMENTARY

JOHN KENNEDY coming off the plane at Love Field with
JACKIE, waving to the crowd.  The sound of a rushing,
monstrous engine.  Then wind.

                          CUT TO:

INT. NIXON'S FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY (1963)

NIXON sits, subdued, in an armchair in a small study,
caught between the fire in the grate, the TELEVISION images
of the assassination, and the phone call he's on.

          NIXON
          (low-key)
     Look, Edgar, these guys were really
     strange, I mean, y'know ...
     extremists, right-wing stuff, Birchers
     ... Yeah?

Nixon listens for several beats.  PAT, smoking nervously,
watches from another chair.  Newspapers are strewn all
around.

DOCUMENTARY IMAGES on the TV show a grieving JACKIE, BOBBY,
TEDDY and the TWO CHILDREN.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     I see ... Oswald's got a Cuba
     connection ... to Castro?  I see.  A
     real Communist.  That makes sense.
     Thank you, Edgar.

He hangs up.  It's evident he's still puzzled, but wants to
believe.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Hoover says this Oswald checks out as
     a beatnik-type, a real bum, pro-Castro
     ...

TV images of BOBBY KENNEDY.

          PAT
     Dick, you should call Bobby.

          NIXON
     He doesn't want me at the funeral.

          PAT
     You don't have to go.

          NIXON
          (glances at TV)
     De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And
     Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't
     not be there.

          PAT
     Then call him.  I'm sure it was an
     oversight.

          NIXON
     No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him
     and Teddy.  They always hated me.

          PAT
     They've lost a brother.  You know what
     that means, Dick.

Nixon sighs, watches the TV -- images of a touch football
game in Hyannis Port.

                    SHARP CUT BACK TO:

INT. NIXON HOUSE - ARTHUR'S BEDROOM - DAY (1925)

ARTHUR NIXON (7) cries in pain.  RICHARD (12) helps FRANK,
his father, hold him on the bed as a DOCTOR twists a long
needle into the base of Arthur's spine.

          ARTHUR
     Daddy!  Please!  Make it STOP!!!

Arthur's eyes roll onto Richard for help, Richard can't
bear it, pulls away.

INT. NIXON HOUSE - PARLOR - DAY (1925)

FRANK comes down the narrow stairs, shocked, fighting
tears.  HANNAH sits reading her Bible.  The BOYS linger
nervously around their made-up cots in the parlor.

          FRANK
          (sobs)
     The doctors are afraid the little
     darling is going to die ...

INT. NIXON HOUSE -  ARTHUR'S BEDROOM - DAY

ARTHUR laps at some tomato gravy on toast, which makes him
happy.  His face is angelic, as if he were getting better.

HANNAH feeds him, cleans his lips with a napkin, as RICHARD
sits close by, squeezing Arthur's hand, puzzled by it all.
FLASHES run through his head -- Arthur sitting on his lap,
learning to read; Dick swinging Arthur by his arms.  DON
and HAROLD are also there.  The Doctor has gone.

          ARTHUR
          (low)
     Thank you, Mama, I feel better ... I'm
     sleepy.

          HANNAH
          (removing the food)
     We'll let thee rest now, my little
     angel.

She tucks him in.  He yawns.  The brothers are awkward,
ready to leave.  Arthur turns his loving eyes on Richard.

          ARTHUR
     Richard, don't you think ... I should
     say a prayer before I sleep?

Richard is awkward, stutters.

          HANNAH
          (nearly cracking)
     Yes, Arthur, I do ...

He smiles at her, then:

          ARTHUR
     If I should die before I wake, I pray
     the Lord my soul to take ...

He slips off, into a coma.

Richard watches, devastated.

INT. NIXON HOUSE - PARLOR - ANOTHER DAY

RICHARD runs to his mother, HANNAH, who is coming down the
stairs with FRANK.  She seems very shaken, but quiet, off
in another world.  The moment Richard reaches her, throwing
his arms around her skirt, she snaps him back.  A harsh,
angry voice.

          HANNAH
     No! ... No.  Don't ...

Richard is shocked as his mother sweeps by in her private
grief.

INT. NIXON'S FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY

RESUME NIXON - his face lost in the silence of the memory.
The television SOUNDS fade back in alongside PAT'S voice.

TV IMAGE - LYNDON JOHNSON being sworn in.

          NIXON
     ... if I'd been president, they never
     would have killed me.

Pat is bewildered by the statement.

          PAT (O.S.)
     Dick?  Are you going to call?

He looks at her, absent.

          PAT (CONT'D)
     Bobby?

He looks back at the TV screen.

          NIXON
          (quietly)
     No ... I'll go through Lyndon.  We'll
     be invited.

We flash suddenly to Kennedy's head being blown apart.
Then back to Johnson as we:

                       CUT FORWARD TO:

DOCUMENTARY

SUBTITLE READS: "FIVE YEARS LATER - 1968"

IMAGE - CLOSE on LYNDON JOHNSON announcing:

          JOHNSON
     ... accordingly, I shall not seek, and
     I will not accept, the nomination of
     my party for another term as your
     president ...

                          CUT TO:

INT. NURSING HOME - DAY

HANNAH NIXON, in her seventies.

          REPORTER 1 (V.O.)
     ... Johnson's  withdrawal resurrects
     Richard Nixon as a strong Republican
     candidate against the war.  His
     mother, Hannah Nixon, just before her
     death last year, commented on her
     son's chances.

          REPORTER 2 (O.S.)
     Mrs. Nixon, do you think your son will
     ever return to politics?

          HANNAH
     I don't think he has a choice.  He was
     always a leader.

          REPORTER 2 (O.S.)
     Do you think he'd make a great
     president, Mrs. Nixon?

          HANNAH
     ... if he's on God's side, yes ...

EXT. NIXON'S FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY (1968)

REPORTERS flock outside the building as NIXON and his GROUP
exit their car, trying to ignore the press.

INT. NIXON'S FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY (1968)

NIXON enters, ebullient, with MITCHELL, HALDEMAN, ZIEGLER,
taking off their winter coats.

          MITCHELL
     Jesus, Dick, never seen anything like
     it!  Even the goddamn Times is saying
     you got it.

          HALDEMAN
     Vietnam's gonna put you in there this
     time, chief.

          ZIEGLER
     We got the press this time!

          NIXON
     And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!

          PAT (O.S.)
     So?  You've decided?

They turn.  PAT is in the corridor.

          PAT (CONT'D)
     Were you planning to tell me?

          NIXON
     We ... haven't announced anything ...
     uh ...

She's walking away, cold.  Dick follows, with a look to his
men.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Uh, wait ...

          MITCHELL
     You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was
     worth five, six million votes.

          NIXON
     Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon
     charm on her.

As he goes:

          HALDEMAN
          (to the others)
     The old Nixon charm?  Who could resist
     that.

INT.   NIXON'S FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

NIXON enters.  PAT is mechanically taking his identical
gray suits from the closet and laying them on the bed.

          NIXON
     Buddy? ...

          PAT
     You should be going ... the primaries
     are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire
     ...

          NIXON
     They love you, Buddy.  They need you,
     too.

          PAT
     I don't want them to love me.

          NIXON
     I need you out there.  It won't be
     like last time.  The war's crippled
     the Democrats.  I can win ... We
     deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy --
     at last.  Nobody knows better than
     you.  Frank Nixon's boy.

Pat slows her packing.  Nixon takes her hand.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Remember what Mom said?  We're not
     like other people, we don't choose our
     way.  We can really change things,
     Buddy.  We've got a chance to get it
     right.  We can change America!

She stops, looks at him, feels his surge of power.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     It was our dream, too, Buddy, together
     ... always.

          PAT
     Do you really want this, Dick?

          NIXON
     This.  Above all.

          PAT
     And then you'll be happy?

The briefest smile opens her face.  He takes the inch,
presses in, hugs her.

          NIXON
     Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will.
     Yeah!

          PAT
          (in his embrace)
     Then I'll be there for you.

          NIXON
          (exultant)
     You're the strongest woman I ever met.
     I love you, Buddy.

          PAT
     Can I just ask for one thing?

          NIXON
     Anything.

          PAT
     Will you ... would you kiss me?

He does so with all the earnestness he is capable of.

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY (1968)

NIXON, fielding questions, is on a small stage, surrounded
by a STUDIO AUDIENCE in a semi-circle.  A mike is around
his neck, no separation from the people.  PAT sits behind
him, a campaign smile painted on.  Nixon is visible to us
on TV monitors inside an engineer's booth.

          NIXON (ON TV)
     I would never question Senator
     Kennedy's patriotism.  But going
     around the country promising peace at
     any price is exactly what the North
     Vietnamese want to hear.

Cheers.  Applause.

          HALDEMAN
          (to the TV director)
     Cue the crowd.  Go to the woman's
     group.  Get the bald guy, he's great
     ...

          NIXON (ON T.V.)
     I, unlike Senator Kennedy, have a plan
     to end the war.  But not for peace at
     any price, but peace with honor!

EXT. LA COSTA COUNTRY CLUB - ESTABLISHING - DAY

EXT. LA COSTA COUNTRY CLUB - PRIVATE PATIO - DAY

J. EDGAR HOOVER (60's), short and fat, covered with steam
room sweat, looks like a Roman emperor, as he watches
television intermittently, taking pictures of CLYDE TOLSON
(50's), his long-time friend and associate.  Tolson has a
towel around his waist and one over his head.

          TOLSON
          (sarcastic)
     What do you think this plan is, Edgar?
     A nuclear attack?

          HOOVER
     He's lying, Clyde.  Always has.
     That's why Nixon's always been useful.
     Hold still.  And take your hand off
     your hip.

JOAQUIN, a very young, near-naked Hispanic boy, comes in
with refreshments: orange slices, fruit, and pastel drinks
with parasols.

                           INTERCUT TO:

INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

RON ZIEGLER checks his scripts as NIXON continues on the
other side of the glass.

          DIRECTOR
          (turns)
     Who's next?

          ZIEGLER
     The Negro.  We gotta have a Negro.

A BLACK MAN appears on the monitors.

          BLACK MAN
     Mr. Nixon ...

          NIXON
     Yes, sir!

          BLACK MAN
     You've made a career out of smearing
     people as Communists.  And now you're
     building your campaign on the
     divisions in this country.  Stirring
     up hatred, turning people against each
     other ...

Ziegler and HALDEMAN are apoplectic.

          HALDEMAN
     What the fuck's he doing?  He's making
     a speech.

          ZIEGLER
     Cut him off!

          DIRECTOR
     I can't cut him off!  This isn't
     Russia!

The Black Man turns to the studio audience.

          BLACK MAN
     You don't want a real dialogue with
     the American people.  This whole
     thing's been staged.  These aren't
     real people.  You're just a mouthpiece
     for an agenda that is hidden from us.

          HALDEMAN
          (screaming)
     Go to commercial!

          DIRECTOR
     There are no commercials.  You bought
     the whole half-hour, baby ...

The Black Man is walking down the aisle toward Nixon.

          BLACK MAN
          (impassioned)
     When are you going to tell us what you
     really stand for?  When are you going
     to take the mask off and show us who
     you really are?

Close on Nixon's upper lip, sweating.

Haldeman watches intently.

          HALDEMAN
     It's a high hard one, chief.  Park it.

Nixon gathers himself, looks firmly at the Black Man.

          NIXON
     Yes, there are divisions in this
     country ...

          BLACK MAN
     Who made them -- you made them!

          NIXON
     ... but I didn't create them.  The
     Democrats did!  If it's a dialogue you
     want, you're more likely to get it
     from me than from the people who are
     burning down the cities!  Just think
     about that ... The great Doctor King
     said the same things.  You know, young
     man, who a great hero is -- Abraham
     Lincoln.  Because he stood for common
     ground, he brought this country
     together ...

The audience applauds.  Haldeman punches Ziegler's arm.

          HALDEMAN
     I love that man!
          (then)
     Fire the sonofabitch who let that
     agitator in!

          ZIEGLER
          (relieved)
     Okay, go to the little girl.  Can he
     see the little girl?

          DIRECTOR
     She's right down front.

          NIXON
     I don't know if you can see her, but
     there's a little girl sitting down
     here with a sign.  Could you hold that
     up, sweetheart?

          ZIEGLER
     Bag the guy.  Take the sign!

The Camera cuts to a LITTLE GIRL holding a hand-lettered
sign.

          NIXON
     The sign has on it three simple words:
     "Bring us together!"  That is what I
     want, and that is what the great
     silent majority of Americans want!

The audience loves it.  APPLAUSE signs light up.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
          (shouts over)
     And that's why I want to be president.
     I want to bring us together!

EXT. LA COSTA COUNTRY CLUB - PRIVATE PATIO - DAY

Like a lizard, HOOVER eyes JOAQUIN, the Hispanic boy.

          TOLSON
     ... give me a break, Mary.

          NIXON (V.O.)
     You all know me.  I'm one of you, I
     grew up a stone's throw from here on a
     little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...

          HOOVER
          (mimics)
     It was the poorest lemon ranch in
     California, I can tell you that.  My
     father sold it before they found oil
     on it.

          NIXON (V.O.)
     It was the poorest lemon ranch in
     California, I can assure you.  My
     father sold it before they found oil
     on it.

          TOLSON
          (mimics)
     But it was all we had.

          NIXON (V.O.)
     ... but it was all we had.

          HOOVER
     You're new.  What's your name?

          JOAQUIN
     Joaquin, Mr. Hoover.

Hoover selects an orange slice, puts one end between his
teeth.  Wiggles it.  Joaquin bends over, bites off the
other end.  Tolson looks peeved.

          NIXON (V.O.)
     My father built the house where I was
     born with his own hands.  Oh, it
     wasn't a big house ...

          HOOVER
     Turn this crap off, Clyde.  It's
     giving me a headache ... You may go,
     Joaquin.

He takes a drink off Joaquin's tray as Clyde turns off the
TV.  Joaquin vanishes.

          HOOVER (CONT'D)
     I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.

          TOLSON
     Edgar, think twice.  He works in the
     kitchen.

          HOOVER
     Not Joaquin, you idiot.  Nixon.  Did
     you hear what he said in Oregon?
     About me having too much power.

          TOLSON
     It's between Nixon and a Kennedy
     again, Edgar ... Who do you want?

          HOOVER
     Kennedy -- never.  He'll fry in hell
     for what he did to me.  But Nixon
     doesn't know that, which is why I'm
     gonna have to remind him he needs us a
     helluva lot more'n we need him.

EXT. DEL MAR RACETRACK - STARTING GATE - DAY

THOROUGHBREDS explode out of the chutes.

EXT. DEL MAR RACETRACK - CLUBHOUSE - DAY

A private box just above the finish line.  HOOVER raises
his binoculars, watching the race.  He is wearing a white
tropical suit, Panama hat, white shoes.  CLYDE is dressed
similarly.

JOHNNY ROSELLI, white hair, deep tan, sharp dresser, sits
with him in the box, spots someone ...

          ROSELLI
     Your boy's on his way up ... I met him
     years ago.  In Havana.

ON THE TRACK: TWO HORSES are in a terrific stretch drive.

HOOVER watches impassively.

          ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
          (frantic)
     And down the stretch they come!  It's
     Sunday's Chance Son and Olly's Boy
     duelling for the lead ...

CLOSE: OLLY'S BOY puts a nose in front of SUNDAY'S CHANCE.

          HOOVER
     He's folding, Johnny.

ON THE TRACK: Sunday's Chance is tiring, falling behind
Olly's Boy.

          ROSELLI
     You just wait a second.

CLOSE: On Olly's Boy bandaged front legs.  Then, Olly Boy's
right foreleg snaps.  It sounds like a rifle shot.

Olly's Boy goes down over his shoulder.  The JOCKEY is
thrown across the track.

The CROWD is stunned.  Sunday's Chance wins easily.

Hoover turns to Roselli.

          TOLSON
     A bit extreme, isn't it?

          ROSELLI
     It's the drama.
          (gestures to the crowd)
     The crowd loves that shit.  Hey!
     There's Randolph Scott.  You might
     like that guy, friend of mine.  Wanna
     meet him?  Edgar?

SHOUTING and CHEERS behind them.  They turn.  NIXON is
making his way down the aisle, waving to the crowd.  He is
followed by HALDEMAN.

Hoover passes Roselli a ticket.

          HOOVER
     Not now, Johnny.  Cash this for me,
     would you?

          ROSELLI
     It's a two-dollar bet, Edgar.  You got
     thousands coming on this ... what the
     fuck?

          HOOVER
     I told you, just cash it, Johnny.  And
     don't swear around me ...

A beat.  Roselli crosses Nixon, who enters the box.

          NIXON
     Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde
     ... hi.

          TOLSON
     Mr. Nixon.

          HOOVER
     Thank you for coming, Dick.

          NIXON
     Winning?

          HOOVER
     Actually, I've just had a bit of luck.

          ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
     The management of Del Mar is saddened
     to announce that Olly's Boy will have
     to be destroyed ...

Groans from the crowd.

          NIXON
     Oh, my goodness ...

          HOOVER
     How about you?  Are you going to win?

          NIXON
     You should ask Bobby.

          TOLSON
          (sarcastic)
     ... little Bobby.

          HOOVER
     Would you walk with me down to the
     paddock?  I'd like to look at the
     horses for the eighth.

          NIXON
     Can't we just talk here?  I've got the
     police chiefs in San Diego.

          HOOVER
     I'm trying to spare you an
     embarrassment.  Johnny Roselli is on
     his way back here.

Nixon looks sick.

          NIXON
     Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?

          HOOVER
     Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.

          NIXON
     I never met the man.

          HOOVER
     I know you've been very careful not
     to.  That's why I'm concerned.

Nixon glances at Hoover.  Hoover smiles.

EXT. DEL MAR RACETRACK - PADDOCK - DAY (1968)

Moving with NIXON, HOOVER and TOLSON along the rail outside
the walking ring.  FBI AGENTS have cleared a circle around
them.  The HORSES for the next race are being saddled.
Nixon waves to PATRONS of the track.

          HOOVER
     You'll win the nomination.

          NIXON
     It could be '60 all over again, Edgar.
     Bobby's got the magic, like a goddamn
     rock star.  They climb all over each
     other just to touch his clothes!
     He'll ride his brother's corpse right
     into the White House.

          TOLSON
     Ummm...

          HOOVER
          (nods)
     If things remain as they are ... He's
     got the anti-war vote.

          NIXON
     Or he'll steal it like his brother.
     He's a mean little sonofabitch, Edgar
     ... He had the IRS audit my mother
     when she was dying in a nursing home.

          HOOVER
     I know ...

          TOLSON
          (casually)
     ... Somebody should shoot the little
     bastard.

          NIXON
     I wanna fight just as dirty as he
     does.

          TOLSON
     ... Use his women.

          NIXON
     ... Any information you have, Edgar.
     The sonofabitch is not gonna steal
     from me again!  Can you back me up on
     this?  Can I count on your support?

          HOOVER
          (amused)
     I look at it from the point of view
     that the system can only take so much
     abuse.  It adjusts itself eventually,
     but at times there are ... savage
     outbursts.  The late "Doctor" King for
     example.  A moral hypocrite screwing
     women like a degenerate tomcat,
     stirring up the blacks, preaching
     against our system ...
          (shakes his head)
     Sometimes the system comes close to
     cracking.

Hoover stop in front of a huge GELDING, pats his muzzle.

          HOOVER (CONT'D)
     We've already had one radical in the
     White House.  I don't think we could
     survive another.

Nixon feels uncomfortable.  Images, vague, disturbing.
Even the nostrils on the horse seem to be emitting a
devil's fire, and the noises of the snorting animal magnify
...

          NIXON
          (a beat)
     Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...

          HOOVER
          (precisely)
     You asked if you could count on my
     support ... As long as I can count on
     yours.

          NIXON (V.O., ON TAPE)
     The old queen did it on purpose.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - LINCOLN SITTING ROOM - NIGHT (1973)

RESUME SCENE - NIXON listens as the tape rolls.

          NIXON (ON TAPE)
     He wasn't protecting me.  He was
     putting me on notice.

          HALDEMAN (ON TAPE)
     What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli?
     Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.

          NIXON (ON TAPE)
     Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any
     gangster.  He was the gangster who set
     up Track 2 in Cuba.

INT. EXEC OFFICE BLDG - NIXON OFFICE - NIGHT (1972)

NIXON and HALDEMAN are alone.  The lights are on.  Nixon's
had a couple of drinks.  The talk is a little looser.

          HALDEMAN
          (confused)
     I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?

          NIXON
     Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba.
     Wherever's there's a need for an
     Executive Action capability, there's a
     Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay
     of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was
     our idea.
          (stands)
     We felt the invasion wouldn't work
     unless we got rid of Castro.  So we
     asked ourselves -- who else wants
     Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money
     people.   So we put together Track 2
     ...

CUBA MONTAGE

Images begin to project from that long-ago time.  A YOUNGER
NIXON.  Macho Cuban "Freedom Fighters" in the Keys and
Guatemala.  The CIA, the MOB -- including JOHNNY ROSELLI.
FAT CATS and CASINO BOSSES shaking hands with young Nixon
on his visit in the 40's.  A Rum and Coca-Cola SONG plays.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
          (softly)
     The first assassination attempt was in
     '60, just before the election.

          HALDEMAN
          (stunned)
     Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?

          NIXON
     He didn't veto it.
          (then)
     I ran the White House side.  The mob
     contact was Johnny Roselli.
          (then)
     One of the CIA guys was that jackass,
     Howard Hunt.

          HALDEMAN
     Jesus!

          NIXON
     And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all
     those Cubans.  All of them in the
     Watergate.  They were involved in
     Track 2 in Cuba.
          (then)
     Hunt reported to my military aide.
     But I met with him several times as
     Vice President.  That's what worries
     the shit out of me.  I don't know how
     much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.

          HALDEMAN
     So?  You wanted Castro dead.
     Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt
     and the others are CIA, why don't we
     just throw this back in the CIA's lap?
     Let Richard Helms take the fall?

          NIXON
          (pause)
     Because ... because Dick Helms knows
     too much ... If anyone in this country
     knows more than I do, it's Hoover and
     Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick
     Helms!  Period.

Pause.

          HALDEMAN
     Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so
     clean in all this, didn't he cancel
     Track 2?

          NIXON
     Because he didn't even know about it.
     The CIA never told him, they just kept
     it going.  It was like ... it had a
     life of its own.  Like ... a kind of
     "beast" that doesn't even know it
     exists.  It just eats people when it
     doesn't need 'em anymore.
          (drops back in his chair)
     Two days after the Bay of Pigs,
     Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my
     ass ...

DOCUMENTARY INTERCUT: Brief, moving, live-action image of
JOHN KENNEDY.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     ... he'd just found out about Track 2.

          HALDEMAN
     You never told him?

          NIXON
          (softly)
     I didn't want him to get the credit.
     He said I'd stabbed him in the back.
     Called me a two-bit grocery clerk from
     Whittier.

Nixon's face expresses the deep hurt of that insult.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     That was the last time I ever saw him.

IMAGE - the "Beast" - an image of Kennedy perverted, his
head blown off ...

          HALDEMAN
     If they didn't tell Kennedy about
     Track 2, how did Hoover find out?

          NIXON
     They had us bugged.  Christ, he had
     everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna
     support me in '68, but he was also
     threatening me.
          (then)
     That was Hoover: he'd give you the
     carrot, but he'd make damn sure the
     stick went right up your ass.

INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - PANTRY - 1968

DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE of chaos in the pantry.  The camera is
jostled.  Women screaming.  A man is being wrestled to the
floor.

ROBERT KENNEDY lies there, mortally wounded.

          NIXON (V.O.)
     When I saw Bobby lying there on the
     floor, his arm outstretched like that
     ...

INT. EXEC OFFICE BLDG - NIXON OFFICE - NIGHT (1973)

RESUME SCENE - NIXON and HALDEMAN

          NIXON
     ... his eyes staring ...
          (then)
     I knew I'd be president.
          (beat)
     Death paved the way, didn't it?
     Vietnam.  The Kennedys.
     It cleared a path through the
     wilderness for me.  Over the bodies
     ... Four bodies.

Haldeman corrects him.

          HALDEMAN
     You mean two ... two bodies?

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - LINCOLN SITTING ROOM - NIGHT (1973)

          HALDEMAN (ON TAPE)
     You mean two ... two bodies?

RESUME SCENE - NIXON takes a slug of Scotch, then he rubs
the bridge of his nose, looks up at the portrait of
Lincoln.  A pause.

          NIXON
          (slurs, softly to Lincoln)
     How many did you have?  Hundreds of
     thousands ... Where would we be
     without death, huh, Abe?

Nixon stands, steadies himself.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
          (softly)
     Who's helping us?  Is it God?  Or is
     it ... Death?

                           CUT BACK TO:

EXT. SANITARIUM CABIN - PORCH - ARIZONA - DAY (1933)

A lunar landscape -- barren, scorched, silent.  Suddenly,
violent, desperate coughing.

HAROLD NIXON (23) is doubled over the railing, a long
string of bloody mucus hanging from his lips.  He is
shockingly emaciated -- the last stages of tuberculosis.
HANNAH NIXON, in background attending TWO OTHER PATIENTS,
looks on at Harold.

RICHARD (19) hurries out of the cabin with a cotton cloth.
He holds Harold until he stops heaving.  Then, he wipes his
mouth.

          HAROLD
          (gasps)
     ... that was a whopper.

Richard carefully folds the cloth, drops it into a metal
container that is already full of them.  He stands there,
helpless, a solemn boy.

          HAROLD (CONT'D)
          (panting)
     Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.

          RICHARD
     What ... ?

          HAROLD
     Go to law school.  Mom and Dad'll be
     able to afford it now ...

Richard looks at him in horror.

          HAROLD (CONT'D)
     Mom expects great things from you ...

          RICHARD
     Harold ... can I get you anything?

Harold throws a loving arm around Richard, who tenses.  We
sense that Harold in some way could have helped Richard,
taught him to laugh a bit.

          HAROLD
          (a gentle smile)
     Relax, Dick, it's just me ... The
     desert's so beautiful, isn't it?
          (then)
     I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go
     home.

          RICHARD
          (stiffly)
     You're not gonna quit on me, are you,
     Harold?

Harold looks out over the landscape.  Silence.

INT. NIXON HOUSE - PARLOR - NIGHT (1933)

RICHARD sits staring into the fire.  He still wears his
black suit from Harold's funeral.  HANNAH enters quietly.

          HANNAH
     Richard?

He looks up at her.

          RICHARD
     I can't ...

          HANNAH
     Thou must.

She moves closer, casting a shadow over his face.

          HANNAH (CONT'D)
     It's a gift, Richard.  This law school
     is a gift from your brother.

          RICHARD
          (bitter)
     Did he have to die for me to get it?!

          HANNAH
     It's meant to make us stronger.
          (kneels)
     Thou art stronger than Harold ...
     stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen
     thee to survive ...

          RICHARD
     What about happiness, Mother?

          HANNAH
     Thou must find thy peace at the
     center, Richard.  Strength in this
     life.  Happiness in the next.

INT. REPUBLICAN CONVENTION - NIGHT (1968)

ON RICHARD NIXON (55) in his prime.  A profile of his face,
as the vast crowd goes berserk.  Nixon absorbs the
adoration: at last, he has arrived.  He looks down at
someone in the audience.  Points, smiles, waves.

Then he steps forward, thrusts his arms in the air -- the
twin-V salute.  The cheers rattle the hall as PAT and their
DAUGHTERS join him, followed by Vice President SPIRO AGNEW
and his FAMILY.  Nixon puts his arm around Pat.  She waves.
The crowd is on its feet.

          NIXON
          (privately, to Pat)
     Now tell me you didn't want this,
     Buddy.

Pat smiles back at him, caught up in it.  Then she kisses
him on the cheek.

                           TIME CUT TO:

NIXON addresses the DELEGATES (a composite of Nixon
speeches).

     United States.  I pledge to you that
     the current wave of violence will not
     be the wave of the future!

Vast APPLAUSE.

          NIXON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
     ... The long dark night for America is
     about to end ... Let us begin by
     committing ourselves to the truth --
     to find the truth, to speak the truth.
     And to live the truth ... A new voice
     is being heard across America today:
     it is not the voice of the protestors
     or the shouters, it is the voice of a
     majority of Americans who have been
     quiet Americans over the past few
     years ... a silent majority.

     Who are they?  Let me tell you who
     they are -- they're in this audience
     by the thousands, they're the workers
     of America, they're white Americans
     and black Americans ...

We cut among the DELEGATES, seeking to show the face of the
populace that is torn by civil war.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     ... they are the Mexican Americans and
     the Italian Americans, they're the
     great silent majority, and they have
     become angry, finally; angry not with
     hate but angry, my friends, because
     they love America and they don't like
     what's happened to America these last
     four years!  We will regain respect
     for America in the world.  A burned
     American library, a desecrated flag
     ... Let us understand: North Vietnam
     cannot defeat or humiliate the United
     States.  Only Americans can do that!

This brings the house down!  As we:

DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE - 6. CHICAGO is now a full-scale POLICE
RIOT.  The COPS have lost all control, swinging nightsticks
wildly, breaking heads, dozens of arrests.

Closing on NIXON at the podium.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Let's face it.  Most Americans today,
     in a crisis of spirit, are simply fed
     up with government at all levels.  All
     the Great Society activists are lying
     out there in wait, poised to get you
     if you try to come after them: the
     professional welfareists, the urban
     planners, the day-carers, the public
     housers.  The costly current welfare
     system is a mess, and we are on the
     brink of a revolt of the lower middle
     class.  The bottom line is -- no work,
     no welfare.  Our opponents have
     exaggerated and over-emphasized
     society as the cause of crimes.  The
     war on poverty is not a war on crime,
     and it is no substitute for a war on
     crime.
          (pause)
     I say to you tonight we must have a
     new feeling of responsibility, of self
     discipline.  We must look to renew
     state and local government!  We must
     have a complete reform of a big,
     bloated federal government.  The
     average American is just like the
     child in the family.  You give him
     some responsibility and he is going to
     amount to something.  If you make him
     completely dependent and pamper him,
     you are going to make him soft, and a
     very weak individual.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     I begin with the proposition that
     freedom of choice in housing,
     education and jobs is the right of
     every American.  On the other hand, I
     am convinced that while legal
     segregation is totally wrong, forced
     integration of housing or education is
     just as wrong!  We simply have to face
     the hard fact that the law cannot go
     beyond what people are willing to
     support.  This was true as far as
     Prohibition was concerned.  It is far
     more true with regard to education and
     housing ... Yet those of us in public
     service know -- we can have full
     prosperity in peace time ...
     Yes, we can cut the defense budget.
     We can reduce conventional forces in
     Europe.  We can restore the national
     environment.  We can improve health
     care and make it available more fairly
     to all people.  And yes, we can have a
     complete reform of this government.
     We can have a new American Revolution.

OMIT SCENE #58

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

The lights are blazing late with war talk.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - SIDE OFFICE - NIGHT

In a small paneled room, the talk is angry: BILL ROGERS,
Secretary of State, MEL LAIRD, Defense Secretary, to one
side; KISSINGER with HAIG, seen earlier, but now
Kissinger's assistant, to the other side of the desk, as
NIXON listens; HALDEMAN takes notes.  ZIEGLER looks on.
Though a stand-up chart displays a large map of Cambodia's
border with South Vietnam, we may note there are no
military personnel in the room.

          ROGERS
     ... It'd be a disaster for us, Mr.
     President.  There's a lot of sympathy
     out there for Cambodia, a tiny,
     neutral Buddhist nation.  There'd be
     protests in the streets, right out on
     your front lawn ...

          LAIRD
     ... Building this Cambodian army up
     will be harder even than the
     Vietnamese army.  They have no
     tradition of ... The government there
     would collapse if we ...

Nixon's eyes narrow, furious.

          NIXON
     So you're saying, "Do nothing" --
     that's what you're saying.  The same
     old shit.  Well, that's not good
     enough.  I'm sick of being pushed
     around by the Vietnamese like some
     pitiful giant.  They're using our POWs
     to humiliate us.  What we need now is
     a bold move to Cambodia; go right
     after the VC base camps, make 'em
     scream.  That's what I think.  You,
     Henry?

A pivotal moment for Henry.  Nixon is clearly scrutinizing
Kissinger, who glances at his rivals.

          KISSINGER
     Well, as you know, most of my staff
     have weighed in against this
     "incursion."  They believe it will
     fail to achieve anything fundamental
     militarily, and will result in
     crushing criticism domestically ...

          NIXON
          (interrupts)
     I didn't ask what your staff thinks,
     Henry.  What do you think?

          KISSINGER
          (pause)
     What I think is ... they're cowards.
     Their opposition represents the
     cowardice of the Eastern
     Establishment.  They don't realize as
     you do, Mr. President, that the
     Communists only respect strength, and
     they will only negotiate in good faith
     if they fear the "madman," Richard
     Nixon.

Nixon lets a dark smile curl one side of his mouth.

          NIXON
     Exactly!  We've got to take the war to
     them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right
     in the nuts.  More assassinations,
     more killings.  Right, Al?

          HAIG
     That's what they're doing.

          NIXON
     These State Department jerks, Bill,
     don't understand;
     you got to electrify people with bold
     moves.  Bold moves make history, like
     Teddy Roosevelt -- "T.R." -- rushing
     up San Juan Hill.  Small event but
     dramatic.  People took notice.

          ROGERS
     They'll take notice all right.

          NIXON
     The fact is if we sneak out of this
     war, there'll be another one a mile
     down the road.
          (pause)
     We bite the bullet here.  In Cambodia.
     We blow the hell out of these people!

          ZIEGLER
     What should we tell the press?

     You see these bums, you know, blowing

The GUARDSMEN are momentarily panicked, confused.

Then, suddenly: they open fire.  A melee.  Screaming.

     Today, less than twenty-four hours

NIXON sits at the head of an outdoor dinner table with
HALDEMAN, EHRLICHMAN, ZIEGLER, KISSINGER.  They are being

     Enraged student groups across the
     country are calling for a general
     strike tomorrow to shut down the
     entire university system until the
     Vietnam War is ended.

MITCHELL joins them.

          NIXON
          (grim)
     How many?

          MITCHELL
     Four.  Two boys.  Two girls.  And
     eight wounded.

          NIXON
     Jesus Christ!

          MITCHELL
     One of the fathers was on the TV
     saying, "My child was not a bum."  And
     it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell,
     Hoover told me one of the girls was a
     nymph.

          NIXON
     Shit, the press doesn't care about the
     facts.  Cronkite's sticking it to me.
     It's their first big hit on Richard
     Nixon.

          ZIEGLER
     The governor says they were rioting.

          EHRLICHMAN
     The governor's full of shit.  Most of
     them were changing classes.

          NIXON
     Oh, I suppose you would've just let
     them take over.  These aren't
     fraternity pranks, John.  It's
     anarchy.  A revolution!

          EHRLICHMAN
     I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.

          NIXON
     Why not?

          EHRLICHMAN
     Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a
     one-term presidency?  Because I think
     right now that's what we're looking
     at.

          NIXON
     I will not go down as the first
     American president to lose a war!
     Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi,
     bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we
     can get out and give the South
     Vietnamese a fighting chance.

          KISSINGER
     Exactly, sir.  That is your historical
     contribution: to lead boldly in an era
     of limits.

          NIXON
          (drinks)
     No one understands! -- even my own
     men.  What do you think the Communists
     respond to?  Honesty, liberal guilt,
     soul-wringing crap, fathers on TV
     crying?  Hell no!  I understand the
     Communist mind, I've studied it for
     thirty years.  They grasp
     "realpolitik" better than any of us,
     right, Henry?

Henry nods.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     We gotta make 'em think we're just as
     tough as they are -- that Nixon's a
     mad bomber, he might do anything!  I
     played a lot of poker in World War II
     (Haldeman and Ehrlichman know the
     story), and I won big, and let me tell
     you this -- unpredictability is our
     best asset.  That redneck Johnson left
     me with a shitty hand and I'm
     bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk
     in Vietnam and the dove in China.
     And if we keep our heads, we can win
     this thing.

          ZIEGLER
     What?  Win Vietnam, sir?

          ALL
     No ...

          NIXON
     No!  But what we can do with Vietnam,
     Ron, is drive a stake through the
     heart of the Communist alliance!
     Henry's already getting strong signals
     from the Chinese.  They hate the Viets
     more than the Russians, and they're
     worried about a unified Vietnam.  The
     Russians hate the Chinese and are
     supporting the Viets, you understand?
     If we stick it out in Vietnam ...
     we'll end up negotiating separately
     with both the Chinese and the Soviets.
     And we'll get better deals than we
     ever dreamed of from both ...

Kissinger nods.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     That's triangular diplomacy,
     gentlemen.

          KISSINGER
     Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is
     my contention.

          NIXON
     That's what geopolitics is about --
     the whole world linked by self
     interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the
     hell I can explain that on television
     to a bunch of simple-minded reporters
     and weeping fucking mothers!

          ZIEGLER
     But what am I telling the press about
     Kent State?

          NIXON
     Tell 'em what you like; they'll never
     understand it anyway.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Excuse me ... Are you talking about
     recognizing China, Mr. President?
     That would cost us our strongest
     support.

          NIXON
     No ... I can do this because I've
     spent my whole career building anti
     Communist credentials.

          HALDEMAN
     If Johnson or Kennedy tried it, they'd
     have crucified them, and rightfully
     so!

          MITCHELL
     It's damned risky, Mr. President.  Why
     don't we wait till the second term?

          NIXON
          (repeats)
     This will get me a second term.  Damn
     it, without risk, there's no heroism.
     There's no history.  I, Nixon, was
     born to do this.

          KISSINGER
     Mr. President, this cannot be
     breathed!  Especially to our secretary
     of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The
     Chinese would never trust us again.
     The only way, I emphasize only way, to
     pull this off is in secret.

          NIXON
          (cackles)
     This is a major coup, gentlemen -- our
     own State Department doesn't even
     know.  And if it leaks out of here
     tonight ...

A pause.  He eyes them.  Discomfort.

          HALDEMAN
     Well, one way or the other, Kent State
     is not good.  We have to get out in
     front of this thing.  The PR is going
     to murder us.

          NIXON
     Money.  Follow the money.

          HALDEMAN
     Sir?

          NIXON
     These kids are being manipulated by
     the Communists.  Like Chambers and
     Hiss.

          MITCHELL
          (smoking his pipe)
     This isn't '48, Dick.  They'll never
     buy it.

          NIXON
          (angry)
     How do you know that, John?  Did we
     try?  Are we just giving up like the
     rest of 'em?  What's Hoover found, for
     God's sake?

          HALDEMAN
     Well, he called the other day, sir.
     He asked for President Harding.

Laughter around the table.

          KISSINGER
     He's an idiot ...

          HALDEMAN
     Seriously, sir, he's gotta go ...

          NIXON
     We can't touch Hoover --

          EHRLICHMAN
     I thought the gloves were off.

          NIXON
     -- as long as he's got secret files on
     everybody.  I don't want 'em used
     against us.
          (frustrated)
     What about the CIA?  Helms's done
     nothing for us.  I want to see him.

          HALDEMAN
     Done.

          MITCHELL
     With Hiss, Mr. President, you had the
     microfilm, you had the lie.  With the
     students, we got no proof.

          NIXON
     The soldiers were provoked.  The
     students started it, for Christ's
     sake!

          EHRLICHMAN
     Sir, there's dead American kids here.
     Let's say we don't apologize for Kent
     State, but maybe we could have a
     national prayer day ...

          HALDEMAN
     ... never complain, never explain,
     John ...

          NIXON
          (yells)
     I tell you, the soldiers were
     provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting
     around.
          (irritated)
     Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever
     give the Democrats a weapon like this?
          (then)
     I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work,
     we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.

They all look at him.  He is resolute.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     That's right!  And if necessary, I'll
     drop the big one.

          KISSINGER
     We have to entertain the possibility
     ...

Nixon looks down at his steak.  It is oozing blood.  Too
much blood -- something is very wrong.  He shoots back,
momentarily terrified.

          NIXON
     Goddamn it!  Who the hell cooked this
     steak?
          (yells)
     Manolo, there's blood all over my
     plate.

NIXON throws down his knife and fork and walks off.

EXT. POTOMAC RIVER - YACHT SEQUOIA - NIGHT (LATER)

NIXON is on the bow, alone, watching the city slip by.
MITCHELL slides up beside him, offering him a freshened
drink.

          MITCHELL
     You all right?

          NIXON
     My brother Harold was about the same
     age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis
     got him.

          MITCHELL
     It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers
     were just kids, too.  They panicked.

          NIXON
     They were throwing rocks, John, just
     rocks.  They don't think I feel ...
     but I feel too much sometimes.  I just
     can't let a whole policy get dominated
     by our sentimentality.

          MITCHELL
     You're doing the right thing, Dick ...
     don't let 'em shake you.

          NIXON
     It broke my heart when Harold died.

          MITCHELL
     That was a long time ago.

Nixon looks out at the water.

          NIXON
     I think that's when it starts.  When
     you're a kid.  The laughs and snubs
     and slights you get because you're
     poor or Irish or Jewish or just ugly.
     But if you're intelligent, and your
     anger is deep enough and strong
     enough, you learn you can change these
     attitudes by excellence, gut
     performance, while those who have
     everything are sitting on their fat
     butts ...
          (then)
     But then when you get to the top, you
     find you can't stop playing the game
     the way you've always played it
     because it's a part of you like an arm
     or a leg.  So you're lean and mean and
     you continue to walk the edge of the
     precipice, because over the years
     you've become fascinated by how close
     you can get without falling ... I
     wonder, John, I wonder ...

Mitchell puts his hand on Dick's shoulder.

          MITCHELL
     Get off that.  That leads nowhere.
     You should offer condolences to the
     families of those kids.

          NIXON
     Sure, I'd like to offer condolences.

He shrugs off Mitchell's hand and walks down the deck into
the shadows.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     But Nixon can't.

INT. LIMOUSINE - THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Leaving the WHITE HOUSE, NIXON looks out at ANGRY
DEMONSTRATORS giving him the finger, shaking placards --
"IMPEACH NIXON" (spelled with a swastika), "PEACE NOW."
With him are HALDEMAN and EHRLICHMAN.

          HALDEMAN
          (with clipboard)
     ... and we've got the economic guys at
     five.  The Dow lost another 16 points.
     They're going to want a decision on
     the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding
     the line on a balanced budget?

          NIXON
     No ... a little deficit won't hurt.
     Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we
     stopping?

          HALDEMAN
          (to the driver)
     Run 'em over.

The presidential limousine has a difficult time negotiating
its way through the BLOCKADING BUSES.  A MAN with a NIXON
mask runs up to the window and peers in, before being
peeled off by SECRET SERVICE.  It is an ugly, violent
scene, but Nixon seems to delight in the threat of action.
He's in an upbeat mood.

          NIXON
     Get that little fucker!  Great tackle!
     Reminds me of my days at Whittier.
     Most of these kids are useless.

          HALDEMAN
     Probably flunking, nothing to do
     except come down here and meet girls.
     Henry's out there with them.

          NIXON
     There's a poison in the upper classes,
     Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too
     many cars, too many color TVs ...

          HALDEMAN
     Don't forget the South, sir, the West.
     Filled with the good football
     colleges, straight kids.  There's more
     of 'em with you than against you.  Not
     like these mudmutts.

          NIXON
     It's the parents' fault really.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Let's not forget they're just kids,
     they don't vote.

          HALDEMAN
     It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are
     you blind?  And we're putting fig
     leaves on the statues ...

          PROTESTOR
     Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh is going to win!

          HALDEMAN
     Get that fucker!

A glum moment.  Haldeman stares at him.  A PROTESTOR waves
a Vietcong flag in Nixon's face.  He gets pulled off the
limo.

          NIXON
          (exhilarated)
     But, hell, this is nothing compared to
     Venezuela.  When I was Vice President,
     Ike sent me down there like a blocking
     back.  They threw rocks, broke out our
     windows, almost overturned the car.
     Read Six Crises, Bob.  Boy, Pat was
     brave!

          HALDEMAN
     Yeah, we've got to get our vice
     president off the golf course and back
     there on the college circuit.  That's
     top priority.

          EHRLICHMAN
     He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every
     time you have him attack the press,
     they give it back to him in spades.
     He's become the most hated man in
     America.

          NIXON
          (chuckles)
     Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better
     him than me.  What the hell is he but
     an insurance policy?

          HALDEMAN
     We gotta keep reminding the media
     pricks, if Nixon goes they end up with
     Agnew.

They all laugh.

          EHRLICHMAN
     He's begging for a meeting, chief.  He
     wants to go overseas for awhile.

          NIXON
     Well, no place where they speak
     English.  That way he can always say
     he was misquoted.

Nixon emits a high, manic laugh.

The PROTESTORS are frustrated as the limousine breaks
through.

INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - DAY (1970)

The SEAL of the CIA: "You shall know the truth and the
truth shall make you free."  We CRANE BACK, revealing that
the seal is on the floor of the LOBBY as NIXON strides in
with his ENTOURAGE.

LT. GENERAL ROBERT CUSHMAN hurries out, ruffled, to meet
NIXON.

          CUSHMAN
     Mr. President, I don't know what to
     say.  As soon as we learned from the
     Secret Service you were en route, the
     Director was notified.  He should be
     here any minute.

          NIXON
     Where the hell is he?

          CUSHMAN
     Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis
     game, sir ...

          NIXON
          (impatient)
     So ... let's go ...

          CUSHMAN
          (walking with Nixon)
     He told me to take you to his
     conference room.

          NIXON
     No.  His office.
          (aside)
     I want a very private conversation.  I
     don't want to be bugged.

          CUSHMAN
     Then his office will be fine.

INT. OPERATIONS CENTER & HELM'S OFFICE - DAY

They walk past ANALYSTS laboring in isolation behind
Plexiglass walls; the hum of computers, a dark austerity to
the place.  They all glance up as NIXON strides past.

          NIXON
     How's the job coming, Bob?

          CUSHMAN
     Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no
     access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have
     a staff.

          NIXON
          (ominous)
     We'll see about that ...

          CUSHMAN
          (sensing change)
     He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're
     looking for a new director.

          NIXON
     Well, he certainly isn't acting like
     it.

          CUSHMAN
     That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a
     world-class poker player.

          NIXON
          (under his breath)
     Yeah?  Well, I own the fucking casino.

INT. HELMS OFFICE - DAY

A DUTY OFFICER opens the door of the director's office with
a flourish.  NIXON catches RICHARD HELMS throwing his
trench coat and tennis racket on a chair, obviously
hurrying in from a secret door.  Helms spots Nixon, extends
his hand with a reptilian smile.

          HELMS
     I'm honored, Dick, that you've come
     all this way out here to Virginia to
     visit us at last.

          NIXON
     My friends call me "Mister President."

          HELMS
     And so shall I.
          (to Cushman)
     Arrange some coffee, would you General
     Cushman?

Cushman stares back a beat, bitterly.  Nixon signals to
Haldeman and Ehrlichman that he, too, wants to be alone.
The door closes.

          NIXON
     Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general
     in the Marine Corps, the Deputy
     Director of the CIA ... and this is
     what you use him for?

          HELMS
     I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr.
     President.  You did.

Nixon paces the office, which is festooned with photos,
awards and an abundance of flowers, particularly orchids.
A collector.

          NIXON
     You live pretty well out here.  Now I
     understand why you want to keep your
     budget classified.

Helms sits on a settee, a hard-to-read man.

          HELMS
     I suppose, "Mister President," you're
     unhappy that we have not implemented
     your Domestic Intelligence plan, but
     ...

          NIXON
     You're correct.  I'm concerned these
     students are being funded by foreign
     interests, whether they know it or
     not.  The FBI is worthless in this
     area.  I want your full concentration
     on this matter ...

          HELMS
     Of course we've tried, but so far
     we've come up with nothing that ...

          NIXON
          (stern)
     Then find something.  And I want these
     leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson,
     the New York Times, the State
     Department -- I want to know who's
     talking to them.

          HELMS
     I'm sure you realize this is a very
     tricky area, Mr. President, given our
     charter and the congressional
     oversight committees ...

          NIXON
     Screw congressional oversight.  I know
     damn well, going back to the '50's,
     this agency reports what it wants, and
     buries what it doesn't want Congress
     to know.  Pay close attention to this.

Nixon fixes him with his stare.  Helms clears his throat.

          HELMS
     Is there something else that's
     bothering you, Mr. President?

          NIXON
     Yes ... It involves some old and
     forgotten papers.  Things I signed as
     Vice President.  I want the originals
     in my office and I don't want copies
     anywhere else.

Now knowing Nixon's cards, Helms relaxes -- about an inch.

          HELMS
     You're referring, of course, to
     chairing the Special Operations Group
     as Vice President.

          NIXON
     Yes ...

Helms wanders over to his prize orchids, fingers them.

          HELMS
     As you know ... that was unique.  Not
     an operation as much as ... an organic
     phenomenon.  It grew, it changed
     shape, it developed ... insatiable,
     devouring appetites.
          (then)
     It's not uncommon in such cases that
     things are not committed to paper.
     That could be very ... embarrassing.

Nixon is embarrassed, and does not like it.  Suddenly, the
Beast is in the room.

          HELMS (CONT'D)
          (reminding him)
     I, for one, saw to it that my name was
     never connected to any of those
     operations.

On Nixon, waiting.

          HELMS (CONT'D)
          (fishing)
     Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala?
     Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take
     similar precautions, Dick.

          NIXON
          (very uncomfortable)
     I'm interested in the documents that
     put your people together with ... the
     others.  All of them ...

A beat.  This is the fastball.  Helms pours himself a
coffee.

          HELMS
     President Kennedy threatened to smash
     the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You
     could do the same ...

          NIXON
     I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is
     secure.

          HELMS
          (stirs the coffee)
     Not if I give you all the cards ...

          NIXON
     I promised the American people peace
     with honor in Southeast Asia.  That
     could take time -- two, maybe three
     years ... In the meantime, your agency
     will continue at current levels of
     funding.

          HELMS
          (sips his coffee)
     Current levels may not be sufficient.

          NIXON
     The President would support a
     reasonable request for an increase.

Helms smiles.

          HELMS
     And me? ...

          NIXON
     Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any
     good.  Of course you'll continue as
     DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.

          HELMS
     And of course I accept.  I'm
     flattered.  And I want you to know, I
     work for only one president at a time.

          NIXON
     Yes.  And you will give General
     Cushman full access.

          HELMS
          (grudgingly accepts that)
     It will take a little time, but I'll
     order a search for your papers.
     Though it does raise a disturbing
     issue.

          NIXON
     What?

          HELMS
     Mr. Castro.

          NIXON
          (tense)
     Yes.

          HELMS
     We have recent intelligence that a
     Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at
     Cienfuegos.

          NIXON
     Well, we'll lodge a formal protest.

          HELMS
     I don't think we can treat this as a
     formality.  Mr. Kennedy made a verbal
     promise to the Russians not to invade
     Cuba.  But you authorized Dr.
     Kissinger to put this in writing.

Nixon is taken aback by Helms's inside knowledge.

          NIXON
     Are you tapping Kissinger?

          HELMS
     My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to
     know what others don't want me to
     know.

          NIXON
          (cold)
     Not if you have spies in the White
     House, it isn't your job.

          HELMS
     It is not my practice to spy on the
     president.  Doctor Kissinger manages
     to convey his innermost secrets to the
     world at large on his own.

          NIXON
          (absorbs this)
     Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism
     in Cuba for ten years ...

          HELMS
     ... But it has never been the policy
     of this government to accept that.
     And it is certainly not CIA policy.

          NIXON
     CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy,
     Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to
     you ...
          (beat, they stare at each
           other)
     I try to adjust to the world as it is
     today, not as you or I wanted it to be
     ten years ago.

          HELMS
     Is that why you and Kissinger are
     negotiating with the Chinese?

A beat.  Nixon stares.

          HELMS (CONT'D)
     This is an extremely dangerous
     direction, Mr. President.  Terrible
     consequences can result from such
     enormous errors in judgement.

          NIXON
     But ... if we were able to separate
     China from Russia once and for all, we
     can -- we could create a balance of
     power that would secure the peace into
     the next century.

          HELMS
     By offering Cuba to the Russians as a
     consolation prize?

          NIXON
     Cuba would be a small price to pay.

          HELMS
     So President Kennedy thought.

A disturbing image suddenly appears in Nixon's mind --
KENNEDY with his head blown off in Dallas.  Followed by an
IMAGE of his own death.  In a coffin.

The smell of the orchids in the room is overwhelming.
Nixon feels himself dizzy.

          NIXON
     I never thought Jack was ready for the
     presidency.  But I would never, never
     consider ...
          (then)
     His death was awful, an awful thing
     for this country.
          (then)
     Do you ever think of death, Mr. Helms?

          HELMS
     Flowers are continual reminders of our
     mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?

          NIXON
     No.  They make me sick.  They smell
     like death ... I had two brothers die
     young.  But let me tell you, there are
     worse things than death.  There is
     such a thing as evil.

          HELMS
     You must be familiar with my favorite
     poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?

          NIXON
     No.

          HELMS
     Black Irishman.  Very moving.
     "Turning and turning in the widening
     gyre / The falcon cannot hear the
     falconer / Things fall apart, the
     center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is
     loosed upon the world / And everywhere
     the ceremony of innocence is drowned /
     The best lack all conviction, while
     the worst are full of passionate
     intensity" ... But it ends so
     beautifully ominous -- "What rough
     beast, its hours come round at last /
     Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?"
     ... Yes, this country stands at such a
     juncture.

On Nixon, we:

                          CUT TO:

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIXON BEDROOM - NIGHT

NIXON has just returned from a dinner party, this tuxedo
coming off, on the phone, a Scotch in hand, in high
spirits.  A series of JUMP CUTS of his phone self as
follows:

          NIXON (ON PHONE)
     It was sudden death, Trini, but I
     think I kicked Helms's ass.
          (laughs)
     Yeah, and Kissinger's running around
     like a scared chicken right now; he
     doesn't know who's gonna grab his
     power.  Yeah ... you should see him.
     I call Haig, Kissinger shits!

More laughter.

                           JUMP CUT TO:

          NIXON (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
     Did you see the look on Hoover's face?
     He was redder than a beet.  That
     little closet fairy's got no choice.
     He hates McGovern and Kennedy so much,
     he's got to love me.  And Lyndon?

PAT enters, in a nightdress, smoking.

          PAT
     He looked old, didn't he?

          NIXON
          (hardly noticing)
     I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you
     do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he
     said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi,
     boy!  Bomb them where they live." ...
     John, do you think I was too soft on
     TV?

                           JUMP CUT TO:

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Bob, I want to get on this energy
     thing tomorrow -- we really have to
     rethink our needs to the end of the
     century.  Let's do it at 1:00.  And
     don't forget the budget boys.  I'm
     gonna carve the shit out of 'em.
          (beat)
     Well, no, clear the afternoon and tell
     Trini I'll be in Key Biscayne by 4:00
     ... No, alone ... Pat's staying here
     with the girls.

Pat approaches him, nuzzles him.  She seems a little
strange, tipsy ... but sexy in her nightdress.

          PAT
     I'd like to go with you.

          HALDEMAN (O.S.)
     Hello?

          NIXON
          (to Pat)
     Uh, you should check with Bob ...
          (to Bob)
     Listen, Bob, I'll call you in the
     morning.

He hangs up, awkward.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in
     here?

          PAT
     I've missed you.

          NIXON
          (suspecting drink on her
           breath)
     Are you okay?

          PAT
     Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne
     together?  Just the two of us.

          NIXON
     Because ... I have to relax.

          PAT
     I was thinking tonight -- do you
     remember, Dick?  Do you remember when
     you used to drive me on dates with the
     other boys?  You didn't want to let me
     out of your sight.

          NIXON
     Yeah, sure, a long time ago.

          PAT
     Yes, it's been a long time ...

A signal has been given.  Nixon recoils, embarrassed.  A
slight sweat.

          NIXON
     I don't need that, Buddy.  I'm not
     Jack Kennedy.

          PAT
          (rebuffed, distant)
     No, you're not.  So stop comparing
     yourself to him.  You have no reason
     to ...
     You have everything you ever wanted.
     You've earned it.  Why can't you just
     enjoy it?

          NIXON
     I do.  I do.  In my own way.

          PAT
     Then what are you scared of, honey?

          NIXON
     I'm not scared, Buddy.
          (a pause)
     You don't understand.  They're playing
     for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the
     kids, the liberals -- they're out
     there, trying to figure out how to
     tear me down.

          PAT
     They're all your enemies?

          NIXON
     Yes!

          PAT
     You personally?

          NIXON
     Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you
     understand that, you of all people?
     It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They
     want to destroy Nixon!  And if I
     expose myself even the slightest bit
     they'll tear my insides out.  Do you
     want that?  Do you want to see that,
     Buddy?  It's not pretty.

          PAT
     Sometimes I think that's what you
     want.

          NIXON
     You've been drinking.  What the hell
     are you saying?  Jesus, you sound like
     them now! ...
          (a beat, quietly)
     I've gotta keep fighting, Buddy, for
     the country.  These people running
     things, the elite ... they're soft,
     chickenshit faggots!  They don't have
     the long-term vision anymore.  They
     just want to cover their asses or meet
     girls or tear each other down.  Oh,
     God, this country's in deep trouble,
     Buddy ... and I have to see this
     through.  Mother would've wanted no
     less of me ... I'm sorry, Buddy.

Pat stands, about to leave.

          PAT
     I just wish ... you knew how much I
     love you, that's all.  It took me a
     long time to fall in love with you,
     Dick.  But I did it.  And it doesn't
     make you happy.  You want them to love
     you ...

Pat waves outward, indicating the world, the public.

          NIXON
          (interjects)
     No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...

          PAT
     But they never will, Dick.  No matter
     how many elections you win, they never
     will.

She leaves.  He is left in the middle of the room.  He
shuffles to the phone, picks it up.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          NIXON (V.O.)
     Manolo!  Where the hell are you?

The lights come on, revealing MANOLO SANCHEZ, the valet, in
the doorway, wearing a bathrobe and slippers.

          MANOLO
     I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can
     I get you?

          NIXON
     Just ... uh ... you know.

          MANOLO
     Of course.

Manolo moves to a cabinet on the far side of the pantry.
Takes out a bottle of Chivas, puts ice into a tumbler.

          NIXON
     Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?

          MANOLO
     Yes, Mr. President.

          NIXON
     We let you down, didn't we.  Your
     people.

          MANOLO
     That was Mr. Kennedy.

          NIXON
     You don't think he was a hero?

Manolo pours Nixon a drink.

          MANOLO
          (shrugs)
     He was a politician.

          NIXON
          (swallows the drink)
     Did you cry when he died?

          MANOLO
     Yes.

          NIXON
     Why?

          MANOLO
     I don't know.
          (then)
     He made me see the stars ...

          NIXON
          (looks outside, to himself)
     How did he do that?
          (then)
     All those kids ... Why do they hate me
     so much?

EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - PRE-DAWN

NIXON gets out of the front of the presidential LIMOUSINE.
MANOLO follows.

Nixon looks up: a surreal scene.  The Lincoln Memorial has
been turned into a pagan temple.  FIRES burn on the broad
marble steps, half-naked KIDS sleep on filthy blankets
below the immense columns.  Hendrix plays faintly on a
portable radio.  Nixon starts up the steps, picking his way
among the sleeping forms.

He passes a GIRL, tripping, eyes closed, twirling a long
scarf over her head.  He stares at her, steps on a sleeping
bag.

          STUDENT 1
     Fuck, man.  That's my fuckin' leg --

The BOY's jaw drops.  Nixon towers over him.  An
apparition.

          NIXON
     You just go back to sleep now, young
     fella.

          STUDENT 1
          (rubs his eyes)
     Whoa, this is some nasty shit ...

Nixon reaches the top of the monument.  Taped to one of the
pillars is a poster.  Nixon scowling, and the motto "Would
You Buy A Used Car From This Man?"

Nixon peers at it, moves inside.  He looks up at LINCOLN in
the eerie firelight.  Banners with peace signs have been
draped over his shoulders, bunches of flowers between his
fingers.

HALF A DOZEN STUDENTS are talking among themselves.  They
see Nixon, stop.  Stunned.  Nixon strides toward them.

          NIXON
     Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.

          STUDENT 2
     You're shittin' me.

          NIXON
     Where you from?

          STUDENT 2
     Syracuse.

          NIXON
     The Orangemen!  Now there's a football
     program.  Jim Brown.  And that other
     tailback ... The one with the blood
     disease ...

          STUDENT 2
     Ernie Davis.

          NIXON
     Right, right.  I used to play a little
     ball myself at Whittier.
          (laughs nervously)
     Of course, they used me as a tackling
     dummy.

A self-possessed YOUNG WOMAN abruptly interrupts.

          YOUNG WOMAN
     We didn't come here to talk about
     football.  We came here to end the
     war.

          NIXON
          (chastened)
     Yes, I understand that.

Pause.  Nobody responds.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Probably most of you think I'm a real
     SOB.  I know that.  But I understand
     how you feel, I really do.  I want
     peace, too, but peace with honor.

          STUDENT 3
     What does that mean?

          NIXON
     You can't have peace without a price.
     Sometimes you have to be willing to
     fight for peace.  And sometimes to
     die.

          STUDENT 3
     Tell that to the GIs who are going to
     die tomorrow in Vietnam.

          STUDENT 2
     What you have to understand, Mr.
     Nixon, is that we are willing to die
     for what we believe in.

          NIXON
          (looking up at Lincoln)
     That man up there lived in similar
     times.  He had chaos and civil war and
     hatred between the races ... Sometimes
     I go to the Lincoln Room at the White
     House and just pray.  You know, the
     liberals act like idealism belongs to
     them, but it's not true.  My family
     went Republican because Lincoln freed
     the slaves.  My grandmother was an
     abolitionist.  It was Quakers who
     founded Whittier, my hometown, to
     abolish slavery.  They were
     conservative Bible folk, but they had
     a powerful sense of right and wrong
     ... Forty years ago I was looking, as
     you are now, for answers.
          (then)
     But you know, ending the war and
     cleaning up the air and the cities,
     feeding the poor -- my mother used to
     feed hobos stopping over at our house
     - none of it is going to satisfy the
     spiritual hunger we all have, finding
     a meaning to this life ...

HALDEMAN arrives with SEVERAL SECRET SERVICE AGENTS,
looking very worried.  The crowd around Nixon has grown
much larger.

          HALDEMAN
     Mr. President!

          NIXON
     It's okay, Bob, we're just rapping, my
     friends and I.  We actually agree on a
     lot of things ...

          YOUNG WOMAN
     No, we don't!  You're full of shit!
     You say you want to end the war, so
     why don't you?  My brother died over
     there last November.  Why?  What good
     was his death?

          NIXON
     I know.  I know.  I've seen a lot of
     kids die, too, in World War II.

          STUDENT 2
     Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany.
     It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil
     war between the Vietnamese.

          NIXON
     But change always comes slowly.  I've
     withdrawn more than half the troops.
     I'm trying to cut the military budget
     for the first time in thirty years.  I
     want an all-volunteer army.  But it's
     also a question of American
     credibility, our position in the world
     ...

          YOUNG WOMAN
     You don't want the war.  We don't want
     the war.  The Vietnamese don't want
     the war.  So why does it go on?

Nixon hesitates, out of answers.

          YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
     Someone wants it ...
          (a realization)
     You can't stop it, can you?  Even if
     you wanted to.  Because it's not you.
     It's the system.  And the system won't
     let you stop it ...

          NIXON
     There's a lot more at stake here than
     what you want.  Or even what I want
     ...

          YOUNG WOMAN
     Then what's the point?  What's the
     point of being president?  You're
     powerless.

The girl transfixes him with her eyes.  Nixon feels it.
The nausea of the Beast makes him reel.  The students press
in on him from all sides.

          NIXON
          (stumbling)
     No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because
     ... because I understand the system.
     I believe I can control it.  Maybe not
     control it totally.  But ... tame it
     enough to make it do some good.

          YOUNG WOMAN
     It sounds like you're talking about a
     wild animal.

          NIXON
     Maybe I am.

A silence.  Nixon looks at her.

Haldeman and the SECRET SERVICE MEN fill the succeeding
beat of silence by moving Nixon off.  He allows himself to
be herded, waving absently to the protestors.

          HALDEMAN
     We really must go, Mr. President.

          NIXON
          (to all)
     Don't forget, the most important thing
     in your life is your relationship with
     your Maker ...
          (over his shoulder to all)
     Don't forget to be on God's side.

This doesn't go down well with the protestors.
("Bullshit!")

As Nixon is led down the steps to the limousine:

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     She got it, Bob.  A nineteen-year-old
     college kid ...

          HALDEMAN
     What?

          NIXON
     She understood something it's taken me
     twenty-five fucking years in politics
     to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia,
     the Wall Street bastards ...

          HALDEMAN
     Sir?

          NIXON
          (climbing into the limo,
           mutters)
     ... "The Beast."  A nineteen-year-old
     kid.  She understands the nature of
     "the Beast."  She called it a wild
     animal.

The door closes.  The LIMOUSINE is whisked away under
searchlights and heavy security.

SUBTITLE READS: "JUNE 1971 - A YEAR LATER"

DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE - The White House is still ringed.
ARMED TROOPS patrol Pennsylvania Avenue.  The BUSES are
drawn up.  SMOKE is in the air.  The SOUNDS of cherry bombs
going off.  Signs that read: "End the war!  Throw the
fascists out!  Dick Nixon before he dicks you!"

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - ROSE GARDEN - DAY

Inside the barricades, a fairyland.  A white lattice gazebo
draped with flowers.  TRICIA's wedding is in preparation.
GROUNDSKEEPERS and various PERSONNEL lay out the carpet to
the alter.

INT. EXEC OFFICE BLDG - NIXON OFFICE - DAY

J. EDGAR HOOVER joins NIXON, pulling on his wedding tuxedo,
at a window, looking out at the PROTESTORS.
Intermittently, Hoover helps him with his clothes.

          NIXON
          (musing)
     There must be a quarter-million out
     there, Edgar.  They've been at it now
     for a year.  Young kids just like
     Tricia.  I don't know.  Do you think
     they have a point, Edgar?  Maybe this
     whole damned system of government is
     ...

          HOOVER
          (suspecting softness)
     Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr.
     President: "The power was lying in the
     streets just waiting for someone to
     pick it up."  The Communists have
     never been closer.  Now is the time to
     go back to the old themes, the ones
     that made you president.  Let the
     Communists know you're onto them.

          NIXON
          (laughs)
     The little bastards think they can
     ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing
     naked in the Reflecting Pond.

          HOOVER
     Don't listen to 'em, don't quit.
     Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King
     were against the war.  Where are they
     now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on
     the war.  President Johnson bombed
     Laos for years and nobody knew or said
     a thing.  How the hell the Times ever
     got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a
     disgrace!

          NIXON
     We can't keep a goddamn secret in this
     government, Edgar.  They're stealing
     papers right out of his office.

          HOOVER
     Johnson had the same damned problem
     till he bugged his own office.

          NIXON
          (nods)
     We took his system out.

          HOOVER
     That was a mistake.  The White House
     was full of Kennedy people then.  It
     still is.

          NIXON
     Who do you think is behind it?

          HOOVER
     Well, you have CIA people all over the
     place.  Helms has seen to that.
          (beat, Nixon remains poker
           faced)
     Then there's Kissinger's staff.
     Kissinger himself, I believe, maybe
     the leaker.

          NIXON
          (stunned)
     Kissinger?

          HOOVER
     He's obsessed with his own image.  He
     wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little
     too much.  As the late "Doctor" King
     proved -- even an ape can win a prize
     with good press.

          NIXON
     Jesus, I'd like to book him into a
     psychiatrist's office.  He comes in
     here ranting and raving, dumping his
     crap all over the place ... Could you
     prove it, Edgar?

          HOOVER
     I always get my man.

          NIXON
     Yeah, you do.
          (then)
     I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd
     get the tapes?

          HOOVER
     No one.  Your property.  It would
     prove your case.  Why do you think
     Kissinger's taping your calls?  For
     history.  His word against yours --
     and right now he's got the records.

Nixon is stung by the comparison, fussing with his bow tie.
Hoover helps him.

          NIXON
     This damned tie ... Will you help me,
     Edgar?
          (then)
     Churchill used to say to me, "If you
     want your own history written
     properly, you must write it yourself."
          (starts out)
     All right, Edgar, but just don't let
     it come back to haunt me.

          HOOVER
          (a reminder)
     It won't.  As long as I'm here.

Nixon absentmindedly shows Hoover through a small door into
his BATHROOM ... There is an awkward pause, as both men are
too proud to pretend they are cramped in this place
together.  Hoover clears his throat and exits the regular
door.  As we hear the Love Theme from "Doctor Zhivago":

                          CUT TO:

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - DAY

The White House GUARDS wear German comic opera uniforms
including tall cylindrical hats with beaks.  We see
champagne, white lace, the MUSICIANS wearing morning coats.
HOOVER and TOLSON are together, very happy.  To the sound
of the wedding MUSIC, NIXON takes a turn with his daughter,
TRICIA, in gown.  He has never seemed happier.

          NIXON
     I am very proud of you today,
     princess.  Very.

When one of the GROOMSMEN cuts in, Nixon asks several
OTHERS to dance.  He retreats to JULIE's side.  Julie says
something sweet but unheard to him.

PAT is at a window, upset, looking out at the PROTESTORS as
Julie comes over to get her.

          JULIE
     Come on, Mother, join the ...
          (sees her look)
     What's the matter?

          PAT
     We're just not going to buckle to
     these people.

Pat puts on her party face and rejoins the crowd.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - CABINET ROOM - DAY (1971) - RAIN

CABINET MEMBERS chat, lean back in their chairs, smoking,
as NIXON suddenly erupts into the room, a focused fury on
his face.  He sits, slams the New York Times down.  CLOSE -
we can make out the words "Pentagon Papers."

          NIXON
     Gentlemen, we've had our last damn
     leak!  This is no way to run a goddamn
     government.  We're going to prosecute
     the hell out of Ellsberg and anyone
     else who wants to leak.  And that
     means any one of you who crosses the
     line, I'm personally going after ...

INTERCUTTING among the faces -- KISSINGER predominant.
Nixon glances in his direction, pause on him.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     The permissiveness of this era is
     over.  The belts are coming off and
     people are gonna be taken to the
     woodshed.  This government cannot
     survive with a counter-government
     inside it.  I know how traitors
     operate -- I've dealt with them all my
     life.  This bullshit to the effect --
     some stenographer did it, some
     stenographer -- that's never the case.
     It's never the little people -- little
     people do not leak.  It's always the
     sonofabitch like Ellsberg who leaks!
     The Harvard Hebrew boys with the
     private agendas who wanna be heroes.

Nixon grabs the paper, shakes it.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Ellsberg did this "for the good of the
     country."  I suppose you've never
     heard that one before.  Alger Hiss and
     the Rosenbergs said the same damn
     crap, and you know what happened to
     them -- ol' Sparky got them.  They've
     always underestimated Nixon, the
     intellectuals.  Well, we're gonna let
     them know we can fight just as dirty.
     This is sudden death, gentlemen.
     We're gonna get 'em on the ground,
     stick in our spikes and twist, show
     'em no mercy!

Nixon looks around the room.  The Cabinet members are
stunned.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     This administration is a goddamn
     disaster.  We got bums out there at
     the gates.  We've got thirty-eight of
     forty pieces of our domestic
     legislation defeated in Congress.
     Unless we turn things around, we'll
     all be looking for jobs next year.
          (then)
     Starting today, nobody in this room
     talks to the press without clearing it
     first with Haldeman.  That means a
     complete freeze on the New York Times,
     CBS, Jack fucking Anderson, and the
     Washington Post!  From now on,
     Haldeman is the Lord High Executioner.
     So don't you come whining to me when
     he tells you to do something, 'cause
     that's me talking.  And if you come to
     me, I'll be tougher than he is.
     Anybody tries to screw us, his head
     comes off.  Do you understand?  Good
     day, gentlemen ...

He walks out, leaving them stunned and silent.

          HALDEMAN
     Well, I guess that's it for today's
     meeting ...

INT. POULTRY PROCESSING PLANT - MIAMI - NIGHT

A chicken's head flies off.  The CUBAN CROWD is going crazy
as a FIGHTING COCK is moving in for the kill.  The ring is
surrounded by impromptu bleachers, the walls lined with
metal cages filled with chickens.  The slaughterhouse is
adjacent.

HOWARD HUNT stands at the edge of the crowd, holding a
greasy wrapper of churos, as the fight ends.

Cheers and groans.  Fistfuls of money are exchanged.

FRANK STURGIS turns from the ring, makes his way to Hunt,
hands him a twenty.

          STURGIS
     How the fuck did you know?

          HUNT
     Injections.  Even this noble sport's
     been fixed.
          (pockets the twenty)
     Seen the guys?

          STURGIS
     They're around.

Sturgis snags a piece of churo, swallows it.

          STURGIS (CONT'D)
     Why, you got a customer?

          HUNT
     The White House.

          STURGIS
          (stops)
     You're fucking me.

          HUNT
     We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're
     gonna plug a leak.

          STURGIS
     Who we working for?

          HUNT
     A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's
     Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?

He motions.

GORDON LIDDY comes out of the edges of the crowd, shakes
hands with Sturgis.

          HUNT (CONT'D)
     Gordon Liddy ... Frank Sturgis.

They turn the handshake into a parallel of the cock fight,
iron grips subtly crush each other's hand.

          LIDDY
          (after they break)
     Y'ever hold your hand over a fire?

Liddy pulls out a Zippo lighter.

          HUNT
     That's okay, Gordon

Hunt motions him off.  As Liddy drifts off:

          STURGIS
     Where'd you find him?

          HUNT
     Just don't tell him to do anything you
     don't really want him to do.

          STURGIS
     So, does Tricky Dick know about this?

          HUNT
     I won't tell him if you won't.

The HANDLERS throw TWO NEW FIGHTING COCKS into the ring.
They start to rip at each other.

          HUNT (CONT'D)
          (chewing on his churo)
     The claws are out, Frank.

INT. FIELDING PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - NIGHT (1971)

As seen before: a GLASS shatters, a CROWBAR jacks open the
door marked: "Dr. Lewis J. Fielding, Psychiatrist."

          NIXON (V.O.)
     History will never be the same.

Cabinets full of pills are overturned.  The disguised HUNT
and LIDDY, with the three CUBANS, go to work.  A FILE
FOLDER is ripped from a cabinet.  In the flashlight beam
the file reads "Daniel Ellsberg."  A VOICE calls out:
"Howard, I got it!"

          NIXON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
     We've taken a step into the future.
     We've changed the world.

"America the Beautiful" MUSIC takes us into:

INT. MAO TSE-TUNG'S OFFICE - BEIJING - DAY (1972)

SUBTITLE READS: "FEBRUARY 1972"

NIXON beams, standing under a huge red flag bearing the
hammer and sickle.  The "America" theme is being played on
a traditional Chinese instrument as CHINESE PHOTOGRAPHERS
are allowed to take stiff portraits.  The MEN chit-chat.

          NIXON
     I must say you look very good, Mr.
     Chairman.

          MAO
     Looks can be deceiving ...

          NIXON
     We know you've taken a great risk in
     inviting us here.

MAO stares at Nixon and replies in Chinese, which the
INTERPRETER repeats:

          MAO
          (half smiles)
     I took no risk.  I'm too old to be
     afraid of what anyone thinks.

Nixon forces a rigid smile as they move to the chairs.

                           TIME CUT TO:

MAO and NIXON are seated in armchairs opposite each other,
KISSINGER and CHOU EN-LAI to either side of Mao.  An
INTERPRETER between.  In media res:

          MAO (CONT'D)
     Don't ever trust them.  They never
     tell the truth or honor their
     commitments.  Vietnamese are like
     Russians.  Both are dogs.

          NIXON
     Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying:
     The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

          MAO
          (smiles)
     That has the added virtue of being
     true.

Mao doesn't seem to be taking any of this too seriously; in
fact, he seems a little medicated.

          KISSINGER
     You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I
     used your writings in my class.

          MAO
     What a waste of time.  My writings
     mean absolutely nothing.

          KISSINGER
     But your writings have changed the
     world, Mr. Chairman.

          MAO
     Fung pi! (Bullshit!)  I've only
     managed to change a few things around
     the city of Beijing.
          (then: to Kissinger)
     I want to know your secret.

          KISSINGER
     Secret, Mr. Chairman?

          MAO
     How a fat man gets so many girls.

Mao howls at his own joke.

          KISSINGER
     Power, Mr. Chairman, is the ultimate
     aphrodisiac.

Laughter.

          MAO
          (turns to Nixon)
     You know, I voted for you in your last
     election.

          NIXON
          (self-effacing)
     I was the lesser of two evils.

A moment.  Mao levels a gaze at him, deadly serious.

          MAO
     You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as
     evil as I am.  We're both from poor
     families.  But others pay to feed the
     hunger in us.  In my case, millions of
     reactionaries.  In your case, millions
     of Vietnamese.

          NIXON
          (taken aback)
     Civil war is always the cruelest kind
     of war.

          MAO
     The real war is in us.
          (then)
     History is a symptom of our disease.

DOCUMENTARY

FOOTAGE - THE BOMBING OF HANOI ... SUBTITLE READS:
"CHRISTMAS 1972."  HUNDREDS OF B-52 STRIKES, BOMBS POURING
OVER THE CITY.

          BBC REPORTER (V.O.)
     In a surprise Christmas bombing of
     Hanoi, President Nixon delivered more
     tonnage than was used at Dresden in
     World War II ... It is, without a
     doubt, the most brutal bombing in
     American history.

CROSSCUT:

DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE - 1. HANOI - the devastation of the
city.  It's on fire.  Bodies are being carried from a
collapsed HOSPITAL. 2. The USA - in contrast, shots in the
media of Christmas trees (Rockefeller Center, etc.);
families shopping; a children's choir singing "Gloria in
Excelsis Deo."

          REPORTERS (V.O.)
     ... This Christmas bombing has shaken
     up the Paris peace talks and created a
     huge amount of criticism across the
     globe.  Newspapers are calling it a
     "Stone Age tactic," and Nixon a
     "maddened tyrant" ... Nixon's only
     response: "When the Vietnamese take
     the peace talks seriously, I'll stop."

STOCK FOOTAGE - moving through a bank of clouds toward the
sun.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE - MAIN CABIN - SUNSET (1972)

NIXON is looking out the window, PAT next to him.  HALDEMAN
and EHRLICHMAN are out of earshot.

          PAT
     Penny for your thoughts.

          NIXON
     Is that adjusted for inflation?
          (she laughs)
     Think of the life Mao's led.  In '52 I
     called him a monster.  Now he could be
     our most important ally.
          (then)
     Only Nixon could've done that.

          PAT
     You're a long way from Whittier.

A beat.  He shares her look.

          NIXON
     Yes ... yes, I am.

Pat puts her hand on his hand.

          PAT
     Congratulations, Dick.

          NIXON
          (smiles)
     How am I going to break this to Bob
     Hope?

KISSINGER walks into the cabin.

          KISSINGER
     We've got the Russians where we want
     them!  They're calling us.  We will
     have a SALT treaty with them this
     year.

          HALDEMAN
     In time for the election?  Brezhnev's
     tough.  He knows McGovern's right on
     our ass ...

          KISSINGER
     He doesn't have a choice!  He has to
     shift missiles from Europe to the
     Chinese border.  With one stroke, the
     balance of power moves completely in
     our favor.  This is a coup, Mr.
     President!

          EHRLICHMAN
     For you, Henry?  Nobel Peace Prize,
     maybe ...

Sees the look on Nixon's face.

          NIXON
     Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm
     kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is
     gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on
     this one.

          PAT
     It's not the press that matters.
     Nixon's wife is proud of him.

He squeezes her hand.

          HALDEMAN
     And his staff.  Come on, the copy they
     were filing from China was great.

          NIXON
     Wait till the Mai-tais wear off.

          EHRLICHMAN
     The country's loving it.

          NIXON
     The hard-core four million "Nixon
     nuts" aren't gonna go for it ...
     They'll say I sold out to the
     Communists.

          KISSINGER
     You'll pick up the middle on this one
     - the Jews and Negros.

          NIXON
     Jews and Negros don't win elections,
     Henry.  Better to hang them around the
     Democrats' necks.

          HALDEMAN
     The Jews aren't the middle, Henry.
     They're the far left.

          NIXON
     You're talking too much about black
     Africa, Henry.  It's killing us with
     the rednecks.

          HALDEMAN
     The blacks are lost, the "schwartzes"
     are gone ...

          NIXON
     Don't let it lose us the right-wing
     vote ...

A silence as the sour notes depress everyone.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
          (feeling the deflation)
     Hey, I sound like my father now.
     Let's have a drink!

Pat smiles.  ZIEGLER pokes his head in.

          ZIEGLER
     Mr. President, the press guys asked if
     you could come back for a minute.

          NIXON
     The hell with 'em.

          KISSINGER
     I'll go back, Mr. President.

Everyone glares at Henry.

          ZIEGLER
     No, they want you, Mr. President.  I
     really think it would be a good move.

          NIXON
     Gentlemen, I go now to discover the
     exact length, width and depth of the
     shaft.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE - PRESS CABIN - SUNSET

NIXON closes the door behind him, turns.

DOZENS of REPORTERS stand, burst into applause.

He is momentarily stunned, then he moves down the aisle.
Shaking hands.  The reporters continue applauding.  Nixon,
for once, is deeply moved.  On the sound of applause, we:

                          CUT TO:

EXT. JONES RANCH - DAY (1972)

          REPORTER (V.O.)
     J. Edgar Hoover is dead at the age of
     seventy-seven.  The legendary crime
     buster served his country as Director
     of the FBI for almost half a century,
     from 1924 to 1972.

An enormous BRAHMA BULL, red-eyed, snorting, thrashes
viciously against the reinforced walls of its pen.  NIXON
and JACK JONES watch as SECRET SERVICE hover nearby.

          JONES (V.O.)
     There's two kinds of bulls, Dick.
     Your good bull and your bad bull.
     This here's a bad bull.  You piss him
     off, he'll kill everything in his
     path.  Only way to stop him is to
     shoot him.

A WRANGLER climbs carefully into the chute.  The Brahma
lunges for him.

          JONES (CONT'D)
     Eddie, you be damned careful with that
     beast.  His nuts are worth a helluva
     lot more'n yours.

He leads Nixon down the steps.

          JONES (CONT'D)
          (cagey)
     So, what's this about, Dick?

          NIXON
     It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's
     third party is only going to help
     McGovern.  I need your support.

          JONES
     Well, you sure been chock full of
     surprises so far, "Mister President."

INT. JONES RANCH - LIVING ROOM - DAY (1972)

NIXON and HALDEMAN are standing by the hearth.  The years
have gone by but, in different clothing and hairstyles, it
is much the same group of a DOZEN BUSINESSMEN gathered
around, drinking Jack Daniels and smoking cigars.  Among
them we recognize the CUBAN and MITCH.  It's heated.

          JONES
     It looks like to me we're gonna lose
     the war for the first goddamned time
     and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going
     along with it, buying into this
     Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with
     the Communists.  "Detente" -- it
     sounds like two fags dancing.

          NIXON
     Jack, we're not living in the same
     country you and I knew in '46.  Our
     people are just not gonna sacrifice in
     major numbers for war.  We can't even
     get 'em to accept cuts in their gas
     tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the
     Japanese are bleeding the shit out of
     our gold ..

          JONES
     And whose fault is that?  If we'd won
     in Vietnam ...

          NIXON
     It's nobody's fault, Jack.  It's
     change -- which is a fact of history.
     Even that old cocksucker Hoover's
     dead.  Things change.

An uncomfortable silence.  A servant brings coffee to
Nixon, but Haldeman cuts him off.  No one gets close to his
guy.

          MITCH
     So ... how's the food over there in
     China, Mr. Nixon?

          NIXON
     Free, if you're the president.

Nervous laughter.

          MITCH
     What are you going to do about this
     Allende fellow nationalizing our
     businesses in Chile?  You gonna send
     Kissinger down there?

          NIXON
     We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende,
     I mean -- just as fast as we can.
     He's on the top of the list.

          MITCH
     How about Kissinger along with him?

          NIXON
     Kissinger's misunderstood.  He
     pretends to be a liberal for his
     Establishment friends, but he's even
     tougher than I am ...

          CUBAN
     So Kissinger stays.  Just like Castro,
     Mr. Nixon?

          NIXON
     Yeah, he stays ...

An uncomfortable silence.  Jones walks closer to Nixon.

          JONES
     Desi's got a point.  What the hell are
     we gonna do about the Communists right
     here in our backyard?!

          NIXON
     What do you mean, Jack?

          JONES
     I mean I got federal price controls on
     my oil.  The ragheads are beating the
     shit out of me.  And I got your EPA
     environment agency with its thumb so
     far up my ass it's scratching my ear.

          HALDEMAN
     Gentlemen, I think it's about time for
     us to be getting to the airport.

          NIXON
     Let him finish, Bob.

          JONES
     ... And now I have a federal judge
     ordering me to bus my kids halfway
     'cross town to go to school with some
     nigger kids.
     I think, Mr. President, you're
     forgetting who put you where you are.

          NIXON
     The American people put me where I am.

Jones smirks.  They all smirk.  A dreadful moment.

          JONES
     Really?  Well, that can be changed.

Dead silence.  Nixon moves closer to Jones.

          NIXON
     Jack, I've learned that politics is
     the art of compromise.  I learned it
     the hard way.  I don't know if you
     have.  But I tell you what, Jack ...
     If you don't like it, there's an
     election in November.  You can take
     your money out into the open, give it
     to Wallace ... How about it, Jack?
     Are you willing to do that?  Give this
     country over to some poet-pansy
     socialist like George McGovern?

Nixon is right in Jones's face now.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Because if you're uncomfortable with
     the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...

          JONES
     Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening
     me, Dick?

          NIXON
          (softly)
     Presidents don't threaten.  They don't
     have to.
          (then)
     Good day, gentlemen.

As he walks out with Haldeman, there is a stone silence.

EXT. TEXAS LANDSCAPE - DAY

As the PRESIDENTIAL CAR pulls away in a three-car
entourage, we hear:

          REPORTERS (V.O.)
     ... With George Wallace out of the
     race, paralyzed by an assassin's
     bullet, Richard Nixon has crushed
     George McGovern in the 1972
     presidential election.  It is the
     second biggest landslide in American
     history, but ...

EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - DAY (STOCK FOOTAGE)

The plane flying through the clouds.  A royal feeling.

          REPORTERS (V.O.)
     ... the Democrats have increased their
     majority in the House and the Senate.
     As the new term begins, there is
     mounting evidence of strong hostility
     to President Nixon's mandate for a
     "New American Revolution."  However,
     it does not seem that the Watergate
     investigations have, up to now,
     damaged Nixon politically in any
     significant way ...

INT. AIR FORCE ONE - PRESIDENT'S CABIN - NIGHT

NIXON looks out the window, turns to HALDEMAN next to him,
making notes on his ubiquitous clipboard.  ZIEGLER is
nearby.

          NIXON
     You know, they all miss the point.
     Probably our biggest achievement as an
     administration, when it's all said and
     done, isn't China or Russia.  It's
     pulling out of Vietnam without a right
     wing revolt.

          HALDEMAN
     I believe you're right, boss.

          NIXON
     ... but even the presidency isn't
     enough anymore ...

          HALDEMAN
     Sir?

          NIXON
     The presidency won't protect us, Bob.
     We're beyond politics now ...

Haldeman is puzzled.  EHRLICHMAN enters the cabin, excited,
extending a cable.  He is followed by long-haired JOHN
DEAN.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Sir, just in from Paris -- the
     Vietnamese have accepted!  Henry's
     peace proposal.  The bombing worked!
     They're caving.

Nixon reads Kissinger's cable, but he doesn't express any
happiness.

          HALDEMAN
          (excited)
     Congratulations, boss.
          (handshake offered)
     A great victory!  The madman theory
     wasn't so crazy after all.

          NIXON
          (to himself)
     This could be it ... this could be it.
     Four long years ...

          EHRLICHMAN
     Henry's on his way back to meet us.
     He wants to make sure he gets in all
     the photographs.  Incidentally ...
     maybe this isn't the right time but
     ... uh, you should know ... Bill
     Sullivan over at the FBI got back to
     us with his report on Kissinger.

Nixon looks up, interested.

          EHRLICHMAN (CONT'D)
          (nods)
     Yeah ... Sullivan thinks Henry's
     leaking.  He's the one ...

          HALDEMAN
     Yeah, I knew it.  I knew it from '69
     on, and I said it all along, didn't I
     ...

Nixon's expression changes totally, narrowing, cold.

          NIXON
     No, you didn't, Bob.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ...
     and to the Times.  Told them he was
     dead set against the bombing, that you
     were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to
     handle you "with kid gloves" ...

Waiting on Nixon, who goes into some inner state alone,
dark brows furrowing with built-up rage.

          HALDEMAN
          (his darker side emerging)
     So that explains his press notices.
     Working both sides of the fence:
     Jewboy Henry, always trying to get his
     Nobel Prize, get laid ...

          NIXON
          (in his own world)
     My God, my God!  He talked to the New
     York Times?

          HALDEMAN
     We ought to fire his whining ass.
     Right now when he's on top.  You know
     what -- it'll set the right example
     for the rest of this administration.

          EHRLICHMAN
     I would personally enjoy doing that,
     sir.

          NIXON
          (conflicted)
     No, no.  He's our only "star" right
     now.  He'd go crying straight to the
     press.  He'd crucify us -- the
     sonofabitch!
          (lethal)
     Get someone from our staff on his ass.
     Tap his phones.  I want to know
     everyone he talks to.

          HALDEMAN
     Then we'll see how long the Kissinger
     mystique lasts.

In a foul mood now, paranoia setting in like a storm cloud
on his face, Nixon shifts back to Dean, who is scared of
this Nixon and tries to pacify him.

          NIXON
     So, what about those Watergate clowns,
     John?  This fuck Sirica's crazy.
     Thirty-five-year sentences!  There
     were no weapons.  Right?  No injuries.
     There was no success!  It's just
     ridiculous.

          DEAN
     Sirica's just trying to force one of
     them to testify.  But they're solid.

          NIXON
     Then what about this Washington Post
     crap?  Woodwind and Fernstein?

          ZIEGLER
          (corrects him)
     Bernstein.

          NIXON
     Who the fuck are they?
          (to Haldeman)
     Bob, are you working on revoking the
     Posts's television license?
          (Haldeman nods)
     Good.

          DEAN
     Well, they're trying to connect Bob
     and John to a secret fund, but they
     don't have much.

          HALDEMAN
          (with a look to Ehrlichman)
     They don't have anything on us.

          DEAN
     The FBI's feeding me all their
     reports.  I didn't think you should
     lose any more sleep on it, sir.

          NIXON
          (mutters, relieved)
     Good man, John, good man.

They all fall silent, feeling that false sense of security
as the sound of the jet engines takes over.  Suddenly,
there is an air pocket and they rock back and forth.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - PRESS CONFERENCE - EAST ROOM - DAY

SUBTITLE READS: "JANUARY 1973"

NIXON is concluding his statement to the PRESS.  HALDEMAN
in the background with ZIEGLER.

          NIXON
     ... I can therefore announce that our
     long and tragic involvement in Vietnam
     is at an end.  Our mission is
     accomplished, we have a cease-fire,
     our prisoners of war are coming back,
     and South Vietnam has the right to
     determine its own future.  We have
     peace with honor.

The REPORTERS are immediately on their feet.  A MONTAGE of
QUICK CUTS follows to give the impression of a hostile and
never-ending barrage of questions without satisfactory
answers.

          REPORTER 1 ("DAN RATHER"-TYPE)
     Sir, isn't it true little has been
     achieved in this peace agreement that
     the Communists have not been offering
     since 1969?
     That in fact your administration has
     needlessly prolonged the war and, at
     certain stages, has escalated it to
     new levels of violence?

                         JUMP TO:

          REPORTER 2 ("LESLIE STAHL"-TYPE)
     Mr. President, what is your reaction
     to James McCord's statement that high
     White House officials were involved in
     the Watergate break-in?

                         JUMP TO:

          REPORTER 3 ("SAM DONALDSON"-TYPE)
     Sir, the Washington Post is reporting
     that Mr. Haldeman and Mr. Ehrlichman
     have secretly disbursed up to $900,000
     in campaign funds.  Is there any truth
     to that?

          NIXON
          (snaps)
     I've said before and I'll say again: I
     will not respond to the charges of the
     Washington Post.  Nor will I comment
     on a matter that's currently before
     the courts.

          REPORTER 4
     Do you intend to cooperate with
     Senator Ervin's committee?

          REPORTER 5
     Will you agree to the appointment of a
     special prosecutor?

The questions flood in.  Nixon is overwhelmed.  He gathers
his papers and starts to move off.  A darkly funny thing
happens: ZIEGLER wanders into his path, almost colliding.
Nixon, pissed, grabs Ziegler by the shoulders, spins him
back towards the REPORTERS, and pushes him at them.
Ziegler stumbles, looks confused.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY (1973)

NIXON storms into his office, picking up an ashtray and
hurling it across the room -- it shatters against the wall.
Everyone in the room with him -- KISSINGER, HALDEMAN,
EHRLICHMAN -- is stunned.

          NIXON
     I end the longest war in American
     history and they keep harping on this
     chickenshit!  You know who's behind
     this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy!
     He drowns a broad in his car and he
     can't run for president.

          EHRLICHMAN
     He got pretty burned at
     Chappaquiddick.

          NIXON
     My point exactly!  Somebody had to die
     before his shit got in the paper!
     Fucking Kennedys get away with
     everything.  Do you see me screwing
     everything that moves?
          (then)
     For Christ's sake!  I did what the New
     York Times editorial page said we
     should do!  I ended the war, I got
     SALT I with the Russians, I opened
     China!  So why are these cocksuckers
     turning on me?  Because they don't
     like the way I look.  Where I went to
     school.

          HALDEMAN
     Because they're not Americans.

          NIXON
     Right.  They don't trust!  They don't
     trust America!

          HALDEMAN
          (venting with him)
     Why would they?!  Who the hell's
     Sulzberger anyway?  Their parents are
     gold traders from Eastern Europe.
     They buy things.  They come to Jew
     York City and they buy up things.  One
     of the things they buy is the New York
     Times.
          (glares at Kissinger)
     And you know what?  Be proud because
     they'll never trust you, sir, because
     we speak for the average American.

Ehrlichman shares a look with Kissinger as Nixon and
Haldeman feed into each other.

          NIXON
     You know why they're turning on me?
     They're not serious about power,
     that's why.  They're playing with
     power.  They're forgetting the
     national interest.  In the old days,
     people knew how to hold power, how to
     set limits.  They wouldn't have torn
     this country apart over a third-rate
     burglary.
     All they care about now are their
     egos, looking good at cocktail parties
     ...

          HALDEMAN
     ... beating out the other papers,
     chasing girls ...

          NIXON
     ... worrying whether someone said
     something "nice" about them.  All
     short-term, frivolous bullshit; Ben
     Bradlee worrying about Teddy Kennedy
     liking him ...

Kissinger tries to get the focus back.

          KISSINGER
     Mr. President, I feel we're drifting
     toward oblivion here.  We're playing a
     totally reactive game; we've got to
     get ahead of the ball.
          (pause, in an embarrassed
           voice)
     We all know you're clean ... Right?
     So let's do a housecleaning.  Take the
     gloves off.

Haldeman shares a look with Ehrlichman.  Is he referring to
them?  Nixon turns slowly on Kissinger, cryptic.

          NIXON
     Housecleaning?  It would be ugly,
     Henry, really ugly ...

          KISSINGER
     But it must be done; your government
     is paralyzed.

          NIXON
     All kinds of shit would come out.
     Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew
     about that, Henry, didn't you?

          KISSINGER
          (vague)
     I ... I heard something ... It sounded
     idiotic.

          NIXON
     Idiotic?  Yes, I suppose it was.

          EHRLICHMAN
     But you're the one who said we should
     expose him as some kind of sex fiend.
     Someone took you literally.

          KISSINGER
          (stung, and suddenly
           knowledgeable)
     I never suggested for some imbeciles
     to go break into a psychiatrist's
     office.  How stupid of ...

          NIXON
     That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The
     point is, you might lose some of your
     media-darling halo if the press starts
     sniffing around our dirty laundry.

          KISSINGER
          (indignant)
     I had nothing to do with that, sir,
     and I resent any implication ...

          NIXON
     Resent it all you want, Henry, but
     you're in it with the rest of us.
     Cambodia, Ellsberg, the wiretaps you
     put in.  The President wants you to
     know you can't just click your heels
     and head back to Harvard Yard.  It's
     your ass too, Henry, and it's in the
     wind twisting with everyone else's.

A stony silence.  The men, all clenched jaws, wait.
Kissinger, icily, clicks his heels and withdraws.

          KISSINGER
          (at the door)
     Mr. Nixon, it is possible for even a
     president to go too far.

          NIXON
     Yeah ...

Nixon laughs maniacally.  JOHN DEAN crosses in as Kissinger
exits.  Dean closes the door behind him.

          HALDEMAN
     You played it perfectly, sir --
     cocksucker!  He's going to think twice
     before he leaks again.

          NIXON
          (exultant)
     He'll be looking in his toilet bowl
     every time he pulls the chain.

They laugh madly, like hatters at a tea party.

          DEAN
          (worried)
     Mr. President, Hunt wants more money.
     Another hundred-and-thirty thousand.

          NIXON
     Son of a bitch.

          DEAN
     He says if he doesn't get it right
     away, he's going to blow us out of the
     water.  And he means it.  Ever since
     his wife died in the plane crash, he's
     been over the edge.

          NIXON
     Pay him.  Pay him what he wants.

          HALDEMAN
     We've got to turn the faucet off on
     this thing.  It's out of control ...
          (as he crosses to Dean, sotto
           voce)
     You might burden just me with this in
     the future.

          NIXON
     It's Helms -- it's got to be.

          HALDEMAN
     We could leverage Helms.

          NIXON
     How?

          HALDEMAN
     When I met with him, he said ...

INT. CIA - HELMS'S OFFFICE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

HELMS, sitting across from HALDEMAN.

          HALDEMAN
     ... this entire affair, the President
     wants you to know, is related to the
     Bay of Pigs, and if it opens up ...

Helms grips the arms of his chair, leans forward excitedly,
and yells at Haldeman.

          HELMS
     The Bay of Pigs had nothing to do with
     this!  I have no concern about the Bay
     of Pigs!!

Haldeman is shocked by Helms's violent reaction, but
remains very cool.

          HALDEMAN
     This is what the President told me to
     relay to you, Mr. Helms.

          HELMS
          (settling back)
     All right ...

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY (1973)

RESUME SCENE - HALDEMAN, EHRLICHMAN, DEAN and NIXON.

          HALDEMAN
          (fishing)
     ... I was wondering what's such
     dynamite in this Bay of Pigs story?
          (Nixon stares, nothing)
     ... although it was clearly effective,
     because all of a sudden it was no
     problem for Helms to go to the FBI and
     try to put a lid on Watergate.

          NIXON
     What about the documents he promised?

          HALDEMAN
     He'll give us the documents.
          (then)
     But I think he should be offered the
     ambassadorship to Iran.  Then he'll go
     without a whimper.

Nixon stares at him, distracted.

          NIXON
     I promised Iran to Townsend.

          HALDEMAN
     Put Townsend in Belgium; it's
     available.

          NIXON
     Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's
     not worth more than 100, 150 ...

          EHRLICHMAN
     What about England?

          NIXON
     Forget it.  Ehrenberg's paid three
     times that much ...

          HALDEMAN
     Helms wants Iran or there might be
     problems.  All of his old CIA buddies
     are over there making a fortune off
     the Shah.

          NIXON
     For God's sake, when does this end?!

          DEAN
          (suddenly)
     Executive clemency ...

          NIXON
     What?

          DEAN
     Hunt has nothing to lose now.  Pardon
     all of them.  Nobody's going to
     investigate a crime for which the
     criminals have already been pardoned.

          NIXON
     I like that.  That's a solution.

          EHRLICHMAN
     It'll never wash.  Pardoning them
     means we're guilty.  The people, the
     press will go nuts.

          NIXON
     And what am I supposed to do?  Just
     sit here and watch them coming closer?
     Eating their way to the center?
          (paces)
     Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR
     cut a deal with Lucky Luciano.
     Christ, even Ike had a mistress!
     What's so special about me?
          (then)
     What about Lyndon?  He could make a
     couple of calls to the Hill and shut
     this whole thing down.  Did anyone
     talk to him?

          HALDEMAN
          (hesitant)
     I did.  He hit the roof.  No dice.  He
     says if you come out with a story
     about how he bugged your plane, he's
     going to reveal ...

He looks at Ehrlichman and Dean, pauses.

We CUT ACROSS the room from Ehrlichman's point of view as
Haldeman whispers the rest of the message in Nixon's ear.

Nixon's face goes ashen.

          NIXON
          (low key)
     All right ... all right.

He walks to the window.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
          (to himself)
     I don't know, I don't know ... I just
     know we've made too many enemies.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to
     testify before Earvin's committee.

          NIXON
     No, you're not!  You're going to claim
     executive privilege and you're going
     to stonewall it all the way -- plead
     the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a
     shit.  They can't force the
     President's people to testify.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Executive privilege will make it look
     like we're covering up.

          NIXON
     We are covering up!  For some petty,
     stupid shit.
          (then)
     There are things I can say -- when
     other people say them, they'd be lies.
     But when I say them nobody believes me
     anyway ...

Pause.  A look between Haldeman and Ehrlichman, puzzled.

          DEAN
     Then we're going to have to give them
     Mitchell.

Nixon turns, stunned.

          NIXON
     Mitchell?  Mitchell's ... family.

          DEAN
     Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes
     here.

Nixon looks like he's just been punched in the stomach.

          HALDEMAN
          (softly)
     John's right.  It's not personal,
     boss.  It's just the way the game is
     played.  Sometimes you have to punt.

Nixon looks out the window.  Suddenly, he looks very old
and very tired in the gray Washington light.

          NIXON
     Jesus, I'm so goddamn worn out with
     this ...

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY

HALDEMAN and EHRLICHMAN leave the President's office.
They're pensive, on the move.  They come to a huddle next
to a window in an isolated alcove.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Who's gonna tell Mitchell?

          HALDEMAN
     You do it.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Why me?

          HALDEMAN
     'Cause he hates you.  It's worse when
     you get it from someone you trust.

          EHRLICHMAN
     He's wrong, you know -- about Kennedy,
     LBJ, Truman.

          HALDEMAN
     How so?

          EHRLICHMAN
     Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like
     this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the
     break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got
     an attempted firebombing at the
     Brookings Institution, planting
     McGovern stuff on the guy that shot
     Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack
     Anderson.

          HALDEMAN
     The "Old Man" plays politics harder
     than anybody else.

          EHRLICHMAN
     You think this is just about politics?

They go inanimate as a White House STAFFER passes.

          EHRLICHMAN (CONT'D)
          (privately)
     You think LBJ would ever have asked
     Hunt to forge a cable implicating John
     Kennedy in the assassination of the
     President of Vietnam?
          (whispering fiercely)
     How long have you known him, Bob?
     Twenty years?
          (then)
     You ever shake hands with him?  You
     ever have a real conversation with
     him?  We don't have a clue what's
     going on inside that man.  And look
     what we're doing for him ...

Ehrlichman glances around to make sure no one is listening.
He leans close.

          EHRLICHMAN (CONT'D)
     This is about Richard Nixon.  You got
     people dying because he didn't make
     the varsity football team.  You got
     the Constitution hanging by a thread
     because the "Old Man" went to Whittier
     and not to Yale.
          (then)
     And what the hell is this "Bay of
     Pigs" thing?  He goes white every time
     it gets mentioned.

Haldeman, more bothered than he pretends, looks around.

          HALDEMAN
     It's a code or something.

          EHRLICHMAN
     I figured that out.

          HALDEMAN
          (low whisper)
     I think he means the Kennedy
     assassination.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Yeah?

          HALDEMAN
     They went after Castro.  In some crazy
     way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't
     think the "P" knows what happened, but
     he's afraid to find out.  It's got him
     shitting peach pits.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Christ, we created Frankenstein with
     those fucking Cubans.

Haldeman sighs, lets his guard down.

          HALDEMAN
     Eight words back in '72 -- "I covered
     up.  I was wrong.  I'm sorry" -- and
     the American public would've forgiven
     him.  But we never opened our mouths,
     John.  We failed him.

          EHRLICHMAN
     Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"?
     That'll be the day.  The whole suit of
     armor'd fall off.

          HALDEMAN
     So you tell Mitchell ...

EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. BRIDGE - NIGHT

JOHN DEAN stands at the center of the bridge, looks down
the Potomac.

          REPORTER (V.O.)
     Lyndon Johnson passed away today at 74
     -- one of the most tragic of American
     presidents ...

          HUNT (O.S.)
     You're early, John.

Dean jumps.  Turns.  HOWARD HUNT is standing behind him.

          DEAN
     I was sorry to hear about your wife.

          HUNT
          (a look)
     Yes ... I got the money.

          DEAN
     The President would like to know if
     that was the last payment.

          HUNT
     I'll bet he would.

          DEAN
     Is it?

          HUNT
          (a beat)
     In Richard Nixon's long history of
     underhanded dealings, he has never
     gotten better value for his money.  If
     I were to open my mouth, all the
     dominoes would fall.

Hunt starts to walk away.

          DEAN
     Can I ask you a question?

Hunt turns.

          DEAN (CONT'D)
     How the hell do you have the temerity
     to blackmail the President of the
     United States?

          HUNT
     That's not the question, John.  The
     question is: Why is he paying?

          DEAN
     To protect his people.

          HUNT
     I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are
     his people.  And we're going to jail
     for him.

          DEAN
     Howard, you'll serve no more than two
     years, then he'll pardon you.

          HUNT
          (lights his pipe)
     John, sooner or later -- sooner, I
     think -- you are going to learn the
     lesson that has been learned by
     everyone who has ever gotten close to
     Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness
     reaching out for the darkness.  And
     eventually, it's either you or him.
     Look at the landscape of his life and
     you'll see a boneyard.

Hunt throws a match into the river.

          HUNT (CONT'D)
     ... And he's already digging your
     grave, John.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY

JOHN DEAN, looking glum, walks down the corridors for his

     FBI Director-designate, L. Patrick
     Gray, shocked the Senate by revealing

     Gray also said that Dean lied when he
     claimed Howard Hunt did not have an

DEAN is explaining his new outlook to a quiet NIXON.

     know about these things because we're
     not criminals.

On Nixon listening behind his desk, hands cupped over his
mouth, frown across his face -- the classic Nixon image of

moves towards a MIKE drilled in the edge of the desk.

     Uh, I would say these people are going
     to cost a million dollars over the
     next two years ...

          NIXON
     We could get that.

          DEAN
     Uh huh ...

          NIXON
     We could get a million dollars.  We
     could get it in cash.  I know where it
     could be gotten.

INTERCUT: the TAPE rolling.

          DEAN
          (pause)
     I'm still not confident we can ride
     through this.  Some people are going
     to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the
     only problem.  Haldeman let me use the
     $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make
     the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role,
     a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in.
     And I'm ...
     uh, I think it's time we begin to
     think in terms of cutting our losses.

          NIXON
          (worried about Dean)
     You say, John, cut our losses and all
     the rest.  But suppose the thing blows
     and they indict Bob and the others.
     Jesus, you'd never recover from that,
     John.  It's better to fight it out
     instead, and not let people testify
     ...

          DEAN
     Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can
     contain it anymore.  There's a cancer
     on the presidency.  And it's growing.
     With every day that ...

          NIXON
     Jesus, everything is a crisis among
     the upper intellectual types, the
     softheads.  The average people don't
     think it's much of a crisis.  For
     Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no
     one's dying here.  Isn't it
     ridiculous?

          DEAN
     I agree it's ridiculous but --

          NIXON
     I mean, who the hell cares about this
     penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it
     right.  He said: "Well for Christ's
     sake, everybody bugs everybody else;
     we know that." ... It's the cover-up,
     not the deed that's really bad here.
          (then)
     If only Mitchell could step up and
     take the brunt of it; give them the
     hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't
     come back for the main course.  That's
     the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's
     going to get it in the neck anyway.
     It's time he assumed some
     responsibility.

Dean has a nervous look in his eye.

          DEAN
     He won't.  He told Ehrlichman he
     won't.

A lightning-like IMAGE reveals MITCHELL, responding to
EHRLICHMAN.  This is Nixon's mind at work.

          MITCHELL
     You tell Brother Dick I got suckered
     into this thing by not paying
     attention to what these bastards were
     doing.  I don't have a guilty
     conscience ... And he shouldn't
     either.

Nixon glances towards the microphone as he moves around the
desk to get closer to Dean.

          NIXON
          (loud and clear)
     He's right.  Maybe it's time to go to
     the hang-out route, John.  A full and
     thorough investigation ... We've
     cooperated with the FBI, we'll
     cooperate with the Senate.  What do we
     have to hide?

          DEAN
          (prompted)
     No, we have nothing to hide.

          NIXON
          (repeating)
     We have nothing to hide.
          (then)
     But the only flaw in the plan is that
     they're not going to believe the
     truth.  That is the incredible thing!

Dean, who is worried about his own hide if the truth comes
out, sees the point of this.

          DEAN
     I agree.  It's tricky.  Everything
     seems to lead back here, and, uh ...
     people would never understand.

Nixon awkwardly puts his arm around Dean's shoulder.  Dean
begins to sense a betrayal in the offing.

          NIXON
     John, I want you to get away from this
     madhouse, these reporters, and go up
     to Camp David for the weekend.  And I
     want you to write up a report.  I want
     you to put everything you know about
     Watergate in there.  Say: Mr.
     President, here it all is.

Another lightning-like IMAGE is Nixon's worst fear -- JOHN
DEAN is at the table, plea-bargaining with TWO PROSECUTORS,
their backs to us.

          DEAN (V.O.)
     You want me to put it all in writing?
     Over my signature?

          NIXON (V.O.)
     Nobody knows more about this thing
     than you do, John.

A pause.

          DEAN
     I'm not going to be the scapegoat for
     this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in
     just as deep as me.

          NIXON
     John, you don't want to start down
     that road.  I remember what Whittaker
     Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he
     was a man who suffered greatly -- he
     said, "On the road of the informer,
     it's always night."
          (then)
     This is beyond you or even me.  It's
     the country, John.  It's the
     presidency.

          DEAN
     I understand that, sir.

          NIXON
     Good.  You know how I feel about
     loyalty.  I'm not going to let any of
     my people go to jail.  That I promise
     you.
          (moves closer)
     The important thing is to keep this
     away from Haldeman and Ehrlichman.
     I'm trusting you to do that, John.  I
     have complete confidence in you.

Off Dean's face we:

                          CUT TO:

TELEVISION SCREEN - NIXON - NIGHT (1973)

NIXON on the TV screen, shaken, ashen-faced.

          NIXON (ON TV)
     I was determined that we should get to
     the bottom of Watergate, and the truth
     should be fully brought out no matter
     who was involved ...

INT. CIA - HELMS'S OFFICE - NIGHT (1973)

RICHARD HELMS, absently watching NIXON on TV, carries a
handful of documents to a CIA incinerator.  He drops them
in the fire, watches them burn.

          NIXON (ON TV)
          (struggles)
     Today, in one of the most difficult
     decisions of my presidency, I accepted
     the resignations of two of my closest
     associates -- Bob Haldeman and John
     Ehrlichman -- two of the finest public
     servants it has been my privilege to
     know ... The counsel to the President,
     John Dean, has also resigned.

CLOSE on Helms burning documents.

LIMBO - HALDEMAN watches TV, his WIFE and CHILDREN next to
him.  He thinks back to:

INT. EXEC OFFICE BLDG - NIXON OFFICE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Haldeman's mind -- the last one-to-one session.  HALDEMAN
leaves the office, looking back over his shoulder at NIXON
alone in the gathering shadows.

          HALDEMAN
     More light, chief?

          NIXON
          (distracted, waves)
     No ...

Haldeman exits.

BACK TO SCENE:

          NIXON (ON TV) (CONT'D)
     ... There can be no whitewash at the
     White House ... two wrongs do not make
     a right.  I love America.  God bless
     America and God bless each and every
     one of you.

          HALDEMAN
          (to himself)
     Sir ... six bodies.

His wife puts her hand on his knee in support.  He squeezes
her hand.

LIMBO -

EHRLICHMAN also watches, with FAMILY.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

NIXON sits at his desk, holding a rigid expression.

          FLOOR MANAGER (O.S.)
     And ... we're clear.

We stay on Nixon as the film lights go off, leaving him in
shadow.  He is devastated.

ALEXANDER HAIG, Nixon's new chief-of-staff, seen earlier,
watches Nixon for a moment, turns to a VIDEO CREW.

          HAIG
          (softly)
     Out.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (1973)

NIXON at one end of the lengthy table, PAT at the other,
eat in a dreadful silence, attended by MANOLO and SERVANTS
who move nervously, anxious to have the dinner over with.

          PAT
          (at last)
     I'm giving a tea for the wives of the
     POWs.

Nixon doesn't respond.

          PAT (CONT'D)
     Are you going to Key Biscayne?

Nixon doesn't look up.

          NIXON
     Yes.

          PAT
     When?

          NIXON
     Tomorrow.

          PAT
     Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been
     calling.  But you won't talk to him
     ... if he's convicted, will you pardon
     him?

          NIXON
     No.

She looks at him.

          PAT
     ... Why are you cutting yourself off
     from the rest of us?
          (then)
     Can't we discuss this?

Nixon slowly sets his spoon down.  An icy stare.

          NIXON
     What exactly did you want to discuss,
     Pat?

          PAT
     You.  What' you're doing --

          NIXON
          (interrupts)
     And what am I doing?

          PAT
     I wish I knew.  You're hiding.

          NIXON
     Hiding what?

          PAT
     Whatever it is you've always been
     hiding.  You're letting it destroy
     you, Dick.  You won't even ask for
     help.  You're destroying yourself,
     Dick.

Nixon pauses, rings the dinner bell.  MANOLO reappears at
the door.

          NIXON
     Mrs. Nixon is finished.

Pat looks as if she's been slapped; slowly puts down her
silverware.  MANOLO clears away her plate.

          PAT
     I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't
     talk to me, you ...

          NIXON
     Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I
     don't want to deal with them.  And
     him.  And you.

Pat sits rigid for a moment.

          PAT
     How much more?  How much more is it
     going to cost?  When do the rest of us
     stop paying off your debts?

Nixon puts down his fork, embarrassed.  Manolo has beaten a
hasty retreat.

          NIXON
     I'd like to finish my dinner in peace.
     It's not too much to ask.

Pat stands slowly.

          PAT
     No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with
     you anymore.  I'm finished trying.

          NIXON
     Thank you.

          PAT
          (incredulous)
     Thank you?
          (then)
     Dick, sometimes I understand why they
     hate you.

Nixon watches her walk out the door.  Then, he picks up his
fork and continues eating.

          SENATOR SAM ERVIN (V.O.)
          (drawls)
     The Senate Select Committee on
     Watergate will come to order ...

A gavel POUNDS O.S.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - HAIG'S OFFICE - DAY

NIXON STAFFERS are gathered around Haig's TV set at as we:

                           CROSSCUT TO:

INT. COMMITTEE CHAMBER - (SEEN ONLY ON TV) - DAY (1973)

JOHN DEAN reads his statement to the COMMITTEE.
Conservatively groomed, horn-rimmed glasses, shorter hair,
Dean speaks in a monotone.  A pretty blond woman, his WIFE,
sits noticeably behind him.

          DEAN (ON TV)
     ... it was a tremendous disappointment
     to me because it was quite clear that
     the cover-up, as far as the White
     House was concerned, was going to
     continue ...

          STAFFERS
     Lying sack of shit!  Little mommy's
     boy -- go tell the teacher, will ya
     ...

HAIG looks at Dean on TV, shakes his head, disgusted, and
goes out.

          HAIG
     The weasel's got no proof.  Just
     remember that it's still an informer's
     word against the President's.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY

HAIG walks past STAFF into the Oval Office.

          DEAN (ON TV)
          (droning on)
     ... it was apparent to me I had failed
     in turning the President around ... I
     reached the conclusion that Ehrlichman
     would never admit to his involvement
     in the cover-up ... I assumed that
     Haldeman would not, because he would
     believe it was a higher duty to
     protect the President ...

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - DAY (1973)

HAIG slides into the room where NIXON and LEONID BREZHNEV,
Premier of the USSR, are engaged in a friendly meeting
through an INTERPRETER.  ANDREI GROMYKO completes the glum
Soviet threesome.

          BREZHNEV
          (in Russian)
     ... Mao told me in 1963: "If I have
     nuclear weapons, let 400 million
     Chinese die, 300 million will be
     left."
          (leans closer)
     Mao suffers from a mental disorder; we
     know this a long time in my country.
          (then)
     This is the man you want to be your
     ally?

          NIXON
     He was your ally for twenty years,
     Leonid.

          BREZHNEV
          (makes a funny gesture)
     Yes, yes, Dick.  Life is always the
     best teacher, you know this -- and you
     too will discover how treacherous he
     can be.  But it must not interfere
     with the building of a SALT II treaty
     between our great countries.  Peace in
     our era is possible ...

Nixon looks to Haig, who whispers something in his ear.

          NIXON
     Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.

Nixon and Haig move to a corner of the room, whisper.

          BREZHNEV
          (to Gromyko)
     If Haldeman and Ehrlichman are
     indicted, it will wound him, perhaps
     fatally.

          GROMYKO
     That depends on who they believe --
     Nixon or Dean.

Brezhnev looks at Nixon, who is visibly shaken.

          BREZHNEV
          (shakes his head)
     Incredible.  He looks like a man with
     little time left.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIXON BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)

Nixon's daughter, JULIE, earnest, bright-eyed, looks at her
father.

          JULIE
          (hesitantly)
     Did you ... Daddy?  Did you cover it
     up?

NIXON looks at her steadily.

          NIXON
     Do you think I would do something like
     that, honey?

Julie shakes her head vigorously, then puts her hands to
her eyes.

          JULIE
     Then you can't resign!  You just
     can't.  You're one of the best
     presidents this country's ever had!
     You've done what Lincoln did.  You've
     brought this country back from civil
     war!  You can't let your enemies tear
     you down!
          (calmer)
     You've got to stay and fight.  I'll go
     out there and make speeches, Dad.  No
     one knows the real you.  How sweet you
     are, how nice you are to people.  I'll
     tell them.

She embraces him almost desperately, kissing him on the
forehead, crying.

          JULIE (CONT'D)
     Daddy, you are the most decent person
     I know.

          NIXON
          (over her shoulder)
     I hope I haven't let you down.

          JULIE
          (hugging him through her
           tears)
     They just don't know; they don't know
     the real you.

On Nixon - CLOSE.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - PAT'S BEDROOM - DAY (1973)

PAT is still wearing her nightdress, coffee and cigarette
in hand, as her press secretary, HELEN SMITH, runs through
a sheaf of papers.  A TELEVISION drones in the background.

          SMITH
          (cheery)
     ... and on Friday we have the high
     school students from Ohio, Saturday is
     the Women's National Republican Club
     ...

          NEWSCASTER 1 (V.O.)
     In a development that could break
     Watergate wide open, Alexander
     Butterfield, testifying today before
     the Senate Select Committee, revealed
     the existence of a taping system that
     may have recorded conversations in the
     White House, the EOB, and the Camp
     David retreat ...

Pat glances up over the top of her glasses.

          SMITH
     And on Sunday you're saying hello to
     the VFW Poppy Girl ...

She realizes Pat is not listening.

          SMITH (CONT'D)
     Mrs. Nixon ... ?

Close: on Pat as she slowly raises a hand to her lips.

          NEWSCASTER 1 (V.O.)
     White House sources say that over the
     past three years, President Nixon has
     recorded virtually every conversation
     he has had, including those with his
     staff, and even members of his own
     family ...

Pat is horrified.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIXON'S BEDROOM - DAY

NIXON sits in his bed, alone, still in his pajamas.  It's
clear he hasn't slept.  He looks shell-shocked.

          NEWSCASTER 1 (V.O.)
     This is a stunning revelation.  If
     such tapes exist, they could tell us
     once and for all: What did the
     President know and when did he know it
     ...

The CAMERA closing on NIXON.  His deepest secrets are now
being revealed.  He begins coughing violently.  He tries to
cover his mouth, but notices now that his hand and the
sheets around him are covered with blood.  He screams,
terrified.

          NIXON
     Oh God - Pat!

                           HARD CUT TO:

INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY (1973)

NIXON on a gurney, being wheeled down a hospital corridor.
PAT, wearing dark sunglasses, is with him, very concerned.
A plastic mask is over his face.

He struggles to get up, but a NURSE gently presses him back
down.  SECRET SERVICE AGENTS surround the gurney.  HAIG
clears the corridors nervously.

          HAIG
     Clear the path!  The President is
     coming through.  Clear a path.  I'm in
     charge here.

PAT gets the DOCTOR's attention on the move.

          PAT
          (privately)
     Is it TB?

          DOCTOR
     No.
     He's sure he has tuberculosis.

          DOCTOR
     No, it's an acute viral pneumonia.
          (lowers his voice)
     But that's not what we're worried
     about.  We found an inflammation in
     his left leg.  It's phlebitis ...

CLOSE on Nixon, eyes closed; the overhead lights reflect in
the mask.

          REPORTERS (V.O.)
     Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald
     Cox has broadened his investigation to
     include President's Nixon's business
     dealings and house payments.  Nixon
     apparently paid no income tax in the
     years 1970, '71 and '72 ... and may
     have illegally used government funds
     to improve his San Clemente Western
     White House.

HAIG holds open the doors as the ORDERLIES push Nixon into
the respiratory unit.

INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - RESPIRATORY UNIT - DAY

A DOCTOR and NURSE remove the mask from NIXON'S face.

          REPORTERS (V.O.)
     Attorney General Elliot Richardson
     will present evidence to a grand jury
     that Vice President Agnew is guilty of
     bribery, extortion and tax evasion ...

Nixon immediately starts gasping.  He again tries to rise,
but hands push him back.  The doctor fits the mouthpiece of
the respirator into Nixon's mouth.  Images of the Beast
pervade the room.

Nixon begins breathing ... His eyes going past PAT to ...

IMAGES OF THE PAST - OF HIS PARENTS, FRANK, HANNAH, LITTLE
ARTHUR, HAROLD ... THE GROCERY STORE.

INTERCUT WITH:

EXT. STREET - DAY

MARTHA MITCHELL is acting strangely behind enormous
sunglasses -- at an impromptu interview on the STREET.

          MARTHA
     ... Can you keep a secret, honey?
     Tween you, me and the gatepost, Tricky
     Dick always knew what was going on ...
     every last goddamn detail.  And my
     husband's not taking the rap this time
     ... They know they can't shut me up,
     so they'll probably end up killing me,
     but I depend on you, the press, to
     protect me ... and my husband, because
     that's what it's going to come to ...

EXT. STREET - DAY

JOHN MITCHELL, angry, beleaguered, bypasses cameras outside
a COURTHOUSE.

          MITCHELL
     She doesn't know what she's talking
     about.  Stop bothering her.  She's not
     well.  Hell, she's nuts -- you
     bastards've seen to that.
          (brushing past another
           question)
     You can stick it right up your
     keester, fella.  Our marriage is
     finished, thank you very much ...

He pushes on.

                         BACK TO:

INT. BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - RESPIRATORY UNIT

NIXON in the hospital, breathing.

          REPORTER (V.O.)
     Archibald Cox declared war on
     President Nixon today by issuing a
     subpoena for nine of the President's
     tapes ...

          NIXON (V.O.)
          (yells)
     Never!  Over my dead body!

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING CORRIDOR - DAY (1973)

NIXON, his leg swollen, limps down the corridor, furious.
HAIG walks with him, ZIEGLER and the lawyer, BUZHARDT,
bringing up the rear.  HAIG clears the corridor of
potential eavesdroppers.

          NIXON
     It's the President's personal
     property!  I will never give up my
     tapes to a bunch of Kennedy-loving
     Harvard Democrat cocksuckers!

          HAIG
     This could trigger the impeachment.
     They'll go to the Supreme Court next.

          NIXON
     Let 'em try!  I appointed three of
     those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my
     tapes!

          HAIG
     Can the president afford to ignore a
     subpoena?

          NIXON
     Who the fuck does Cox think he is?
          (fumes)
     I never made a dime from public
     office!  I'm honest.  My dad died
     broke.  You know the sonofabitch went
     to law school with Jack Kennedy? ...
     The last gasp of the Establishment!
     They got the hell kicked out of 'em in
     the election, so now they gotta squeal
     about Watergate 'cause we were the
     first real threat to them in years.
     And by God, Al, we would have changed
     it, changed it so they couldn't have
     changed it back in a hundred years, if
     only ...

          HAIG
     Congress is considering four articles
     of impeachment, sir.

          NIXON
     For what?!

          BUZHARDT
     Sir, the charges are serious -- first,
     abuse of power; second, obstruction of
     justice; third, failure to cooperate
     with Congress; and last, bombing
     Cambodia ...

          NIXON
     They can't impeach me for bombing
     Cambodia.  The President can bomb
     anybody he wants.

          ZIEGLER
     That's true ...

          BUZHARDT
     Sir, we'll win that one, but the other
     three ...

          NIXON
     You know, Fred, they sell tickets.

          ZIEGLER
     Sir?

          NIXON
     They sell tickets to an impeachment.
     Like a fucking circus ... Okay, so
     they impeach me.  Then it's a question
     of mathematics.  How many votes do we
     have in the Senate?

A beat.  Then:

          HAIG
     About a dozen.

          NIXON
          (wounded)
     A dozen?  I got half of 'em elected.
     I still got the South and Goldwater
     and his boys.  I'll take my chances
     with the Senate.

          ZIEGLER
     We should ...

          HAIG
     Then we'll have to deal with the
     possibility of removal from office,
     loss of pension, possibly ... prison.

          NIXON
     Shit, plenty of people did their best
     writing in prison.  Gandhi, Lenin ...

          ZIEGLER
     That's right.

          NIXON
          (beat, glowers darkly)
     What I know about this country, I ...
     I could rip it apart.  If they want a
     public humiliation, that's what
     they'll get.  But I will never resign
     this office.  Where the fuck am I?

They look at him strangely.  They've stopped at the doors
of the East Room.  The SOUND of VOICES and VIOLIN playing
inside.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
          (to Ziegler)
     What's in there?

          ZIEGLER
     POWs.  And their families.

          NIXON
     So I'm supposed to be ...

          ZIEGLER
     Compassionate.  Grateful.

          NIXON
     Proud?

          ZIEGLER
          (confused)
     Sir?

          NIXON
     Of them.

          ZIEGLER
     Yes, yes.

          NIXON
          (back to Haig, bitterly)
     Fire him.

          HAIG
     Who?

          NIXON
     Cox!  Fire him.

          HAIG
     But he works for the Attorney General.
     Only Richardson can fire him.

          BUZHARDT
          (concerned)
     Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...

          NIXON
          (ignoring Buzhardt, to Haig)
     Then tell Richardson to fire him.

          HAIG
     Richardson won't do that.  He'll
     resign.

          NIXON
     The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If
     you have to go all the way down to the
     janitor at the Justice Department,
     fire the sonofabitch!  And ...

          ZIEGLER
     He asked for it.

          HAIG
     May I just say something, sir?  I
     think you should welcome the subpoena.
     The tapes can only prove that Dean is
     a liar.

          ZIEGLER
     That's right, sir.

A moment.

          NIXON
     There's more ... there's more than
     just me.  You can't break, my boy,
     even when there's nothing left.  You
     can't admit, even to yourself, that
     it's gone, Al.
          (pointing to the East Room)
     Do you think those POWs in there did?

          ZIEGLER
     No, sir ...

          NIXON
     Now some people, we both know them,
     Al, think you can go stand in the
     middle of the bullring and cry, "Mea
     culpa, mea culpa," while the crowd is
     hissing and booing and spitting on
     you.  But a man doesn't cry.
          (then)
     I don't cry.  You don't cry ... You
     fight!

INTERCUT soft IMAGES over NIXON being pounded at FOOTBALL.

Nixon straightens himself, puts on a smile, nods to
Ziegler.  Ziegler opens the door.  A ROAR of CHEERS and
MARTIAL MUSIC greets the President, as he disappears
inside.

TELEVISION SCREEN - NBC LOGO - LIMBO

          ANNOUNCER
     We interrupt this program for a
     special report from NBC News.

A REPORTER appears, stunned.

          REPORTER (ON TV)
     The country tonight is in the midst of
     what may be the most serious
     constitutional crisis in history.
     In the wake of Vice President Spiro
     Agnew's forced resignation on charges
     of corruption, President Nixon has
     fired Special Prosecutor Archibald
     Cox.

DOCUMENTARY IMAGES - ARCHIBALD COX walking in the street,
having heard the news, smiling.

          REPORTER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
     Attorney General Elliot Richards has
     resigned rather than comply with the
     President's order, and Deputy Attorney
     General William Ruckelshaus was fired
     when he refused to carry out the order
     ...

DOCUMENTARY IMAGES - FBI AGENTS carrying boxes of files out
of the Special Prosecutor's office.  RUCKELSHAUS getting
into a car, refusing to comment.  ELLIOT RICHARDSON moving
down the gauntlet of REPORTERS.  We CUT BACK to the
REPORTER on camera, grim.

          REPORTER (ON TV) (CONT'D)
     Tonight, the country, without a Vice
     President, stands poised at a
     crossroads -- has a government of laws
     become a government of one man?

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT (1973)

As before, the black iron bars.  The facade of the mansion.
The light in the second floor.  We move in slowly.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - LINCOLN SITTING ROOM - NIGHT (1973)

NIXON is really drunk now, listening to some GIBBERISH on
the tape.  We move in on his profile, framed by Lincoln in
the background.  We should not be able to make out the
voices -- occasional words like "Castro," "Kennedy."  But
that's about it ... nothing more.  And as we move closer on
Nixon, bleary-eyed, we should feel he has no idea, either,
of what he's listening to.  It's just ... noise.  PAT's
voice cuts in.  She's standing at the doorway.  She's been
drinking too, but is sharp.

          PAT
     They're like love letters.  You should
     burn them.

Nixon, startled, tries to shut off the tape, but he hits
the wrong button and we hear high-speed VOICES in reverse.

          PAT (CONT'D)
     Why didn't you?

          NIXON
          (slurs)
     You can't expect me to explain that to
     you.

          PAT
     What matters to me is whether you
     understand it.

A beat.  He finally gets the tape stopped.

          NIXON
     They're evidence.  You can't legally
     destroy evidence.

Pat stares at him.

          PAT
     You don't expect me to believe that
     for one minute, do you?
          (then)
     Does it matter what's on them?
     Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your
     secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me
     and you and ...

          NIXON
     Don't be ridiculous!

          PAT
     I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how
     ugly you can be -- you're capable of
     anything.  But you see, it doesn't
     really matter, at the end of the day,
     what's on them.  Because you have
     absolutely no remorse.  No concept of
     remorse.  You want the tapes to get
     out, you want them to see you at your
     worst ...

          NIXON
     You're drunk!

Pat laughs, "Yeah, I am."

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     No one will ever see those tapes.
     Including you!

A beat.

          PAT
     And what would I find out that I
     haven't known for years.
          (then)
     What makes it so damn sad is that you
     couldn't confide in any of us.
     You had to make a record ... for the
     whole world.

          NIXON
     They were for me.  They're mine.

          PAT
     No.  They're not yours.  They are you.
     You should burn them.

She turns and walks out.  Nixon is turbulent, upset.  He
turns and suddenly sees the ghost of his young mother,
HANNAH, sitting there in the shadows, staring at him.

He jumps.  Those eyes of hers.  Penetrating, gazing right
through him.

          HANNAH
     What has changed in thee, Richard ...
     When thou were a boy ...

          NIXON
          (blurts out)
     No!  Please!  Don't talk to me!
     Anything ... but don't talk to me.

A SHARP CUT snaps us from the reverie, and Nixon is alone
in his sitting room, the door closed, the VOICE on the tape
droning.  He downs pills with the Scotch.

          NIXON (ON TAPE) (CONT'D)
     ... these guys went after Castro.
     Seven times, ten times ... What do you
     think -- people like that, they just
     give up?  They just walk away?
          (then)
     Whoever killed Kennedy came from this
     ... this thing we created.  This Beast
     ... That's why we can't let this thing
     go any farther.

He looks over at the recorder, slowly turning.  He pushes
"Stop" and then runs it back on "Rewind."  High-speed
voices.  He pushes "Stop" again.  A series of TIME CUTS
shows Nixon getting drunker, playing all sections of the
tape.  The camera closes on the tape machine.  It's all a
blur as we hear a HUM growing louder and louder, as we inch
in on an abstract CLOSE-UP of the TAPE moving across the
capstan.

          REPORTER (V.O.)
     In the latest bombshell, the
     President's lawyers revealed that
     there is an eighteen-and-a-half minute
     gap in a critical Watergate tape ...

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - DAY (1974)

A frenzy of paperwork as the PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS --
BUZHARDT and ST. CLAIR -- sit hunched around a table piled
with transcripts, helped by TWO YOUNG ASSISTANTS.

NIXON is aghast as he reads some of the highlighted
sections.  HAIG and ZIEGLER attend.

          REPORTER 1 (V.O.)
     ... In an attempt to head off
     impeachment proceedings, the President
     has agreed to release transcripts of
     forty-six taped conversations ...

          REPORTER 2 (V.O.)
     ... In a simple ceremony, Gerald Ford
     was sworn in as Vice President.  A
     longtime, popular member of Congress,
     Ford reinforces a sense of ...

          REPORTER 3 (V.O.)
     ... citing White House wrong-doing,
     the judge has dismissed all charges
     against Daniel Ellsberg.

          REPORTER 4 (V.O.)
     ... the grand jury has indicted former
     Nixon aides Bob Haldeman, John
     Ehrlichman and former Attorney General
     John Mitchell ...

Nixon shakes the paper in the faces of Buzhardt and St.
Clair.

          NIXON
     You're lawyers.  How can you let this
     shit go by!
          (points)
     Look!  This?  Nixon can't say this.

          BUZHARDT
     You did say it, sir.

          NIXON
     Never.  I never said that about Jews!

Buzhardt glances at St. Clair.

          BUZHARDT
     We could check the tape again, sir.

          NIXON
     You don't need to check the tape.  I
     know what I said.

He grabs the Magic Marker out of the lawyer's hand and
furiously blacks out an entire section.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost
     your mind?  Nixon can't say this.
     "Niggers"!

          ZIEGLER
     Well, we could delete it.

          ST. CLAIR
     We're doing the best we can, sir.

          NIXON
     Well, it's not good enough ...

          ST. CLAIR
     We can black it out.

          ZIEGLER
     Or we could write "expletive deleted."

          NIXON
     ... and get rid of all these
     "goddamns" and "Jesus Christs"!

          ST. CLAIR
     Sir, all these deletion marks in the
     transcripts will make it look you
     swear all the time.

Nixon grows cold, stares steadily at St. Clair.

          NIXON
     For Christ's sake, it soils my
     mother's memory.  Do you think I want
     the whole goddamn world to see my
     mother like this?  Raising a dirty
     mouth!

          BUZHARDT
     But sir, we'll have to start over from
     the beginning.  We don't have the
     staff to ...

Nixon loses it, sweeps the pile of transcripts off the
table.  They fly around the office.

          NIXON
          (screams)
     Then start over!  The world will see
     only what I show them.  From page one!

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT (1974)

NIXON sits at his desk, grimacing tightly into the TV
CAMERA.  Next to him is a stack of blue binders emblazoned
with the presidential seal.

          NIXON
     Good evening, my fellow Americans.
     Tonight I'm taking an action
     unprecedented in the history of this
     office ...

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - HAIG'S OFFICE - NIGHT (1974)

KISSINGER and HAIG watch NIXON on television.  They share a
drink.

          NIXON (ON TV)
     ... an action that will at last, once
     and for all, show that what I knew and
     what I did with regard to the
     Watergate break-in and cover-up were
     just as I have described them to you
     from the very beginning ...

          HAIG
     He's completely lost touch with
     reality.

          NIXON (ON TV)
     I had no knowledge of the cover-up
     until John Dean told me about it on
     March twenty-first.  And I did not
     intend that payment to Hunt or anyone
     else be made ...

          KISSINGER
     Can you imagine what this man would
     have been had he ever been loved?

          NIXON (ON TV)
     ... because people have got to know
     whether or not their President is a
     crook.  Well, I am not a crook.  I
     have never made a dime from public
     service ...

          KISSINGER
     Oh God, I'm going to throw up.

          HAIG
     They'll crucify him ...

Kissinger turns to Haig.

          KISSINGER
     Does anybody care anymore?
          (then)
     What happens after ... ?

They share a look.

                           INTERCUT TO:

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - PAT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

PAT sits alone, drinking, as the television drones on with
the latest invasion of her privacy.  As we move in, we see
the spirit drawn out of her.  She seems numb.

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DOCUMENTARY IMAGE - NIGHT (1974)

          REPORTERS (V.O.)
     The Supreme Court ruled today eight-to
     zero that President Nixon's claims of
     "executive privilege" cannot be used
     in criminal cases, and that he must
     turn over all subpoenaed tapes ... a
     firestorm on Capitol Hill as ...

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDORS & STAIRS - NIGHT (1974)

SUBTITLE READS: "JULY 1974," over EMPTY SHOTS of an EMPTY
HOUSE, filled with gloom and dread.  The FOOTSTEPS of two
silhouettes crack the silence as they make their way
towards the Lincoln Sitting Room.  It is an eerie echo of
the film's opening shots of the White House.  The
silhouettes now become apparent as GENERAL HAIG and HENRY
KISSINGER.

          REPORTERS (V.O.)
     ... The House Judiciary Committee has
     voted twenty-seven-to-eleven to
     recommend impeachment to the full
     House.  The deliberations now go to
     the House floor ... In its report, the
     Committee offers evidence that Nixon
     obstructed justice on at least thirty
     six occasions, that he encouraged his
     aides to commit perjury, and that he
     abused the powers of his office ... In
     a separate report, the Senate Select
     Committee details the misuses of the
     IRS, the FBI, the CIA and the Justice
     Department.  It denounces the
     Plumbers, and it raises questions of
     whether the United States had a valid
     election in 1972.

HIGH ANGLE - Haig knocks and enters the Lincoln Sitting
Room.  A shaft of LIGHT from inside zigzags the darkness.
And we hear a snatch of LOUD MUSIC before the door is
closed.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - LINCOLN SITTING ROOM - NIGHT (1974)

NIXON sits in his chair in a suit and tie, listening to
"Victory at Sea" at top volume.  In front of him is a
picture album -- 1922 portraits of the NIXON FAMILY.
HAROLD holding ARTHUR.  RICHARD stares glumly at the camera
between HANNAH and FRANK.

GENERAL HAIG, with KISSINGER behind, approaches with some
papers held out in his hand.  Nixon sees them, turns down
the hi-fi.

          NIXON
     "Victory at Sea," Al ... Henry.  The
     Pacific Theatre.  Christ, you can
     almost feel the waves breaking over
     the decks.

          HAIG
     I'm afraid we have another problem,
     Mr. President.

He hands him a paper.  Nixon glances at it.

          HAIG (CONT'D)
     June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part
     that's underlined.  Your instructions
     to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the
     FBI.

          NIXON
     So?

          HAIG
     Your lawyers feel it's the ...
     "smoking gun."

          NIXON
     It's totally out of context.  I was
     protecting the national security.  I
     never intended --

          HAIG
     Sir, the deadline is today.

          NIXON
     Can we get around this, Al?

          HAIG
     It's the Supreme Court, sir; you don't
     get around it.

Nixon, silenced, looks down at the paper in his hands and
sighs.

          HAIG (CONT'D)
     If you resign, you can keep your tapes
     as a private citizen ... You can fight
     them for years.

          NIXON
     And if I stay?

A long moment.

          HAIG
     You have the army.

Nixon looks up at him, then over at Henry.

          NIXON
     The army?

          HAIG
     Lincoln used it.

          NIXON
     That was civil war.

          HAIG
     How do you see this?

Nixon closes his eyes.  Haig takes the transcript back.

          HAIG (CONT'D)
     We can't survive this, sir.  They also
     have you instructing Dean to make the
     payoff to Hunt.

          NIXON
     There is nothing in that statement the
     President can't explain.

          HAIG
     Sir, you talked about opening up the
     whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.

          NIXON
     That's right ...

          HAIG
     Three days before, on the June
     twentieth tape -- the one with the
     eighteen-minute gap --

          NIXON
          (interrupts)
     I don't know anything about that.

          HAIG
          (continues)
     ...
     you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs"
     several times.  Sooner or later
     they're going to want to know what
     that means.  They're going to want to
     know what was on that gap ...

          NIXON
     It's gone.  No one will ever find out
     what's on it.

Haig moves closer and leans down, very low, whispers.

          HAIG
     They might ... if there were another
     ... recording.

Nixon glances up at him.

          HAIG (CONT'D)
     We both know it's possible.
          (then)
     I know for a fact it's possible.

Nixon stares up at him.

          HAIG (CONT'D)
     I've spoken to Ford ... And there's a
     very strong chance he'll pardon you
     ...

Haig hands him a letter of resignation.

INSERT: "I hereby resign the office of President of the
United States."

          HAIG (CONT'D)
     This is something you will have to do,
     Mr. President.  I thought you would
     rather do it now ... I'll wait
     outside.

Haig drifts out as Kissinger comes out of the shadows.
Nixon looks down blankly at the sheet of paper in front of
him.

          KISSINGER
     May I say, sir, if you stay now it
     will paralyze the nation and its
     foreign policy ...

Nixon looks up at Kissinger.  The Judas himself -- at least
one of them.  There is irony here that is apparent to Nixon
but not to Kissinger.

          NIXON
     Yes, you always had a good sense of
     timing, Henry.  When to give and when
     to take.
     How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will
     react?
          (sitting up, suddenly
           intense)
     Do you think this is how they'll
     remember me, Henry, after all the
     great things you and I did together?
     As some kind of ... of ... crooks?

          KISSINGER
          (prepared response)
     They will understand, sir.  To be
     undone by a third-rate burglary is a
     fate of biblical proportions.  History
     will treat you far more kindly than
     your contemporaries.

          NIXON
     That depends who writes the history
     books.  I'm not a quitter ... but I'm
     not stupid either ... A trial would
     kill me -- that's what they want.
          (with some satisfaction)
     But they won't get it.

He signs the resignation paper.  A pause.  It lies there.

          KISSINGER
          (grandiosely)
     If they harass you, I, too, will
     resign.  And I will tell the world
     why.

          NIXON
     Don't be stupid.  The world needs you,
     Henry; you always saw the big picture.
     You were my equal in many ways.
          (then)
     You're the only friend I've got,
     Henry.

          KISSINGER
     You have many friends ... and admirers
     ...

          NIXON
     Do you ever pray?  You know ...
     believe in a Supreme Being?

          KISSINGER
     Uh ... not really.  You mean on my
     knees?

          NIXON
     Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a
     lot.  It's been a long time since I
     really prayed.
          (a little lost)
     Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a
     little.

As Nixon gets down on his knees, Kissinger perspires
freely.  He clumsily follows the President down to the
floor.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     ... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass
     you.

          KISSINGER
     Not at all.  This is not going to
     leak, is it?

          NIXON
          (looks at Henry)
     Don't be too proud; never be too proud
     to go on your knees before God.

He prays silently, then suddenly he sobs.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Dear God!  Dear God, how can a country
     come apart like this!  What have I
     done wrong ... ?

Kissinger is experiencing pure dread, his shirt soaked with
sweat.  He opens his eyes and peeks at Nixon.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     ... I opened China.  I made peace with
     Russia.  I ended the war.  I tried to
     do what's right!  Why ... why do they
     hate me so!

A silence.  Nixon wraps his arms across his chest and rocks
back and forth in an upright fetal position.  Kissinger,
looking very distressed, reaches over and touches the
President, trying awkwardly to console him.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
          (woozily at his hands)
     It's unbelievable, it's insane ...

On that note, we:

                          CUT TO:

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - CORRIDORS & ENTRY - NIGHT (1974)

A solitary SENTINEL -- a Marine Guard -- stands at strict
attention, eyes forward, as we hear the VOICES of:

The THREE SILHOUETTES of NIXON, KISSINGER and HAIG walking
out.  HIGH ANGLES allow us to hear their VOICES echoing off
the empty rooms, and sometimes catch a glimpse of a passing
face.
From the voice we can tell that Nixon has resumed his
customary bluffness, a sense of bravado in the face of
defeat.

          NIXON (O.S.)
     ... they smelled the blood on me this
     time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ...
     that rusty, metallic smell ...

          HAIG (O.S.)
     I know it well, sir.

          NIXON (O.S.)
     It came over from Vietnam, you know.

          HAIG (O.S.)
     Sir?

          NIXON (O.S.)
     That smell.  I mean, everybody
     suffered so much, their sons killed.
     They need to sacrifice something,
     y'know, appease the gods of war --
     Mars, Jupiter.  I am that blood,
     General.  I am that sacrifice, in the
     highest place of all ... All leaders
     must finally be sacrificed.

They turn a corner, come into more light.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     Things won't be the same after this.
     I played by the rules, but the rules
     changed right in the middle of the
     game ... There's no respect for
     American institutions anymore.  People
     are cynical, the press -- God, the
     press -- is out of control, people
     spit on soldiers, government secrets
     mean nothing ...

Nixon separates from Haig and Kissinger who bid him a last
"Mr. President."

          NIXON (CONT'D)
          (remote)
     I pity the next guy who sits here ...
     Goodnight, gentlemen ...

Haig and Kissinger depart.

Nixon shuffles back alone, coming to a stop in front of a
larger-than-life, full-length oil portrait of JOHN F.
KENNEDY.  Nixon studies the portrait, pads closer.  Looks
up.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     When they look at you, they see what
     they want to be.
          (then)
     When they look at me, they see what
     they are ...

PAT, overhearing, comes from the shadows in a nightgown.
She looks weary, crazed.

          PAT
     Dick, please don't ...

He half turns to her.  He is unshaven, eyes red-rimmed, a
wounded animal who can no longer defend himself.

          NIXON
     I can't ... I just don't have the
     strength anymore ...

His voice trails off.  For a moment, it looks like he's
going to collapse.  Pat moves toward him to support him.

          PAT
     It'll be over soon.

          NIXON
     No ... it's just going to start now
     ...
          (looks into her eyes)
     If I could just ... If I could just
     ... sleep.

          PAT
     There'll be time for that.

He's barely aware of her.

          NIXON
     Once ... when I was sick, as a boy ...
     my mother gave me this stuff ... made
     me swallow it ... it made me throw up.
     All over her ... I wish I could do
     that now ...

Pat puts her arm around him.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     I'm afraid, Buddy ... There's darkness
     out there.

Pat is crying now.  She tries to soothe him, strokes his
brow like a sick child.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     I could always see where I was going.
     But it's dark out there.
     God, I've always been afraid of the
     dark ... Buddy ...

Nixon breaks down.  She slowly leads him up the grand
staircase -- into the shadows of history.

INT. THE WHITE HOUSE - EAST ROOM - DAY

The EPILOGUE and END CREDITS run over NIXON as he addresses
the assembled WHITE HOUSE STAFF.  PAT and the FAMILY flank
him.

          NIXON
     ... I remember my old man, I think
     they would've called him a little man,
     a common man.  He didn't consider
     himself that way.  He was a streetcar
     motorman first, and then he was a
     farmer, and then he had a lemon ranch.
     It was the poorest lemon ranch in
     California, I assure you.  He sold it
     before they found oil on it.

IMAGES of FRANK and HANNAH NIXON now arise in Nixon's
consciousness -- a past he would never really connect his
own life to.  As if it were a storybook, a fabled America
that never was.  The MUSIC should, in a sense, accentuate
this divorce of sentiment from reality.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     ... and then he was a grocer.  But he
     was a great man because he did his
     job, and every job counts up to the
     hilt, regardless of what happens ...
     Nobody will ever write a book,
     probably, about my mother.  Well, I
     guess all of you would say this about
     your mother: my mother was a saint.
     And I think of her, two boys dying of
     tuberculosis and seeing each of them
     die, and when they died ... Yes, she
     will have no books written about her.
     But she was a saint ... But now,
     however, we look to the future.

Nixon is holding himself together by sheer force of will.
Many members of his STAFF are weeping.  He pulls an old
well-leafed book open, puts a set of eyeglasses on to read
from it, the first time he's ever worn them in public.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     ... I remember something Theodore
     Roosevelt wrote when his first wife
     died.  He was still a young man, in
     his twenties, and this was in his
     diary -- "T.R." -- ... "She was
     beautiful in face and form and
     lovelier still in spirit ...
     When she had just become a mother,
     when her life seemed to be just begun,
     and when the years seemed so bright
     before her, then by a strange and
     terrible fate death came to her.  And
     when my heart's dearest died, the
     light went from my life forever ..."
     That was "T.R." in his twenties.  He
     thought the light had gone from his
     life forever.

He puts down the book, nearly cracking.

          NIXON (CONT'D)
     ... But of course he went on to become
     President, sometimes right, sometimes
     wrong, always in the arena, always
     vital ... We sometimes think, when
     things happen that don't go the right
     way, we think that when someone dear
     to us dies, when we lose an election,
     when we suffer a defeat, that all is
     ended ... but that's not true.  It is
     only a beginning, always; because the
     greatness comes not when things always
     go good for you, but the greatness
     comes, and you're really tested, when
     you take some knocks, some
     disappointments, when sadness comes
     ... Because only if you have been in
     the deepest valley can you ever know
     how magnificent it is to be on the
     highest mountain ... To have served in
     this office is to have felt a very
     personal sense of kinship with each
     and every American.  In leaving it, I
     do so with this prayer.  May God's
     grace be with you in all the days
     ahead.

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

A MARINE CORPS HELICOPTER waits at the end of a red carpet.
NIXON and PAT make their way towards it, followed by
FAMILY.

          NIXON (V.O.)
     ... Remember: always give your best,
     never get discouraged, never be petty.
     Always remember: Others may hate you,
     but those who hate you don't win
     unless you hate them ... and then you
     destroy yourself.

They climb the steps and Nixon turns on the top step and
smiles bravely.  Then he waves good-bye.

          NIXON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
     ... Only then will you find what we
     Quakers call "peace at the center."
     Au revoir -- we'll see you again!

He raises his arms in his characteristic twin-V salute.
And we:

                              FADE OUT.

EPILOGUE runs over a DARK SCREEN

          EPILOGUE
     Nixon always maintained that if he had
     not been driven from office, the North
     Vietnamese would not have overwhelmed
     the South in 1975.  In a sideshow,
     Cambodian society was destroyed and
     mass genocide resulted.  In his
     absence, Russia and the United States
     returned to a decade of high-budget
     military expansion and near-war.
     Nixon, who was pardoned by President
     Ford, lived to write six books and
     travel the world as an elder
     statesman.  He was buried and honored
     by five Presidents on April 26, 1994,
     less than a year after Pat Nixon died.

We include a DOCUMENTARY CLIP of his FUNERAL, eulogized by
President CLINTON, the four other PRESIDENTS alongside him.
ROBERT DOLE eulogizes him as a "great American."

          EPILOGUE (CONT'D)
     For the remainder of his life, Nixon
     fought successfully to protect his
     tapes.  The National Archives spent
     fourteen years indexing and
     cataloguing them.  Out of four
     thousand hours, only sixty hours have
     been made public.

We end on an IMAGE OF YORBA LINDA, CALIFORNIA ... turn of
the twentieth century where it began.  We focus on the
faces of the early pioneers who settled the land -- we
drift over the faces of HANNAH and FRANK, in their stern
postures -- past the BROTHERS, including the two deceased
ones ... to little RICHARD, eyes all aglow with the hopes
of the new century.
