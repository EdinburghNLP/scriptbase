The Ice Storm by James Schamus. Based on the novel by Rick Moody. First Draft Revised January 5, 1996


EXT. TRAIN - DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN

Suburban Connecticut, outside of New York City, 1973. The
still after a terrible storm. Trees dripping, their branches
torn, the air warming just before the break of a new day. The
train lies dark and motionless, a few flashing yellow
emergency lights up front, as a work crew removes debris from
the track.

INT. TRAIN. PRE-DAWN

Various passengers, huddled uncomfortably, cold, asleep.

On Paul Hood, 15-and-a-half, stoner-preppie look, hunched up
in his seat under the faint emergency exit light. He reads
his Fantastic Four comic book by the pale light of the
emergency exit sign.

Suddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the
train's engines returns.

The conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic
nasal voice.

               CONDUCTOR 
     Good morning ladies and gentlemen --

He sounds like a baseball announcer.

               PASSENGERS
          (mumbling, ad lib)
     What ladies?

               CONDUCTOR 
     -- this train originating at New
     York's Grand Central Station is
     back in service - next stop will be
     New Canaan, Connecticut. New
     Canaan, Connecticut, next stop!

He moves on to the next car.

The train begins to move.

Paul rubs his elbow against the window and looks out into the
still-dark early morning.

He looks back down at his comic book.

On the comic book: Reed Richards (also known as Stretch) has
zapped his young son with a cosmic ray gun to neutralize the
destructive energy that Annihilus has implanted in him. 

The Thing, Medusa, Flame, and Richards' wife Sue Storm look
on, stunned.
     "THEN YOU'VE TURNED HIM INTO A
     VEGETABLE. YOUR OWN SON." "DON'T
     YOU SEE, SUE? HE WAS TOO
     POWERFUL... IF HIS ENERGY HAD
     CONTINUED TO BUILD, HE WOULD HAVE
     DESTROYED THE WQRLD!"

Paul looks up again, thinking.

               PAUL (V.O.)
     In issue number 141 of The
     Fantastic Four, published in
     November 1973, Reed Richards has to
     use his anti-matter weapon on his
     own son, who Annihilus has turned
     into a human atom bomb. His son is
     the result of Richards' coupling
     with the earthling Sue Storm, and
     the problem is that the cosmic rays
     that infused Richards and the rest
     of the Fantastic Four on their
     aborted moon mission have made
     young Franklin a volatile mixture
     of matter and anti-matter.

EXT. TRAIN BRIDGE. PRE-DAWN

The train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested
landscape.

               PAUL (V.O.)
     And that's what it is to come from
     a family, if you analyze it
     closely. Each of them is negative
     matter for the other ones. And
     that's what dying is -- dying is
     when your family, which is in fact
     your personal negative matter from
     which you emerge -- it's when the
     family takes you back, thus hurling
     you back into negative space...

INT. TRAIN. CONT'D.

On Paul, as the sun breaks over the horizon. His face glows
warmly in the yellow light. He looks down idly at the comic
book.

               PAUL (V.O.)
     So it's a paradox -- the closer
     you're drawn back in, the further
     into the void you're thrown.

EXT. CONRAIL STATION. EARLY MORNING

The train slowly pulls in.

The train doors open, and Paul, weary from the long night,
emerges. He sees his family gathered at the other end of the
platform -- Ben, 40, a bit worse for wear but still retaining
traces of his boyish looks; Elena, 37, distant and elegant
even in her oversized sweater; and Wendy, 14, a sullen
suburban Lolita.

He pauses, regarding them.

They stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him.

EXT. ST. PETER'S SCHOOL. MORNING

To establish. A typical New England prep school.

INT. PAUL AND FRANCIS'S DORM ROOM. MORNING

Cramped, a mess, but quaint. Paul shares the room with
Francis Davenport IV, a dissolute, smart-ass son of money.

Paul's alarm clock rings. He slams his hand down on it and
jumps out of bed, fully clothed in his rumpled preppie
uniform of frayed khakis, loose tie, shirt with one tail
untucked in, etc. Across the room, Francis beckons from his
desk, as he finishes loading up a four-foot-high bong.

               FRANCIS 
     Arise and shine, young Hood.

               PAUL 
     I hope you changed the water in
     that bong from last night.

               FRANCIS 
          (finishing a hit)
     The water, as you call it, is a
     special mixture of amaretto and
     Ben&Ben blended for just the exact
     chemical interaction with the last
     of our precious Thai stick.

Paul reluctantly walks over and takes a hit. He coughs,
spewing uninhaled smoke.

               FRANCIS (CONT'D)
     Waste not Master Hood -- that was
     $20 for the bag.

               PAUL 
          (gathering books, papers,
           almost talking to
           himself)
     Man, Francis, you are one drug
     addled elitist freak, and when the
     revolution comes I do not want to
     be lined up with you and shot,
     'cause you're fucking ripe for
     political reeducation, you know,
     like in the fields.

               FRANCIS 
     Paul, cancel your mental
     appointments, baby. What are you,
     like still stoned from last night?

               PAUL 
          (spraying some chloroform
           mouth spray)
     I gotta get to English class.

INT. ST PETERS' CLASSROOM. DAY

An English class in progress.

Paul Hood sits blankly, hardly listening, until he hears the
teacher call out.

               TEACHER 
     Libbets?

               LIBBETS 
     What Dostoyevsky is saying here is
     that to be a Christian is to
     choose, because you have to choose
     of your own choice, but since you
     can't choose to be good because
     that would be too rational you have
     to choose to be bad -- it's
     existential.

               TEACHER 
     Thank you Libbets, that's a very
     compelling summary, but --

Paul looks at her, smitten. Marge, Paul's friend, notices his
look.

INT. ST. PETER'S HALLWAY. DAY

As class lets out, Paul accosts Libbets.

               PAUL 
     Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm
     also really a fan, and what you
     were saying, you know, have you
     ever read The Idiot?

               LIBBETS 
     The Idiot?

               PAUL 
     If you liked Notes from
     Underground, you'll love The Idiot.

               LIBBETS
          (turning to go)
     Great, thanks for the tip.

               PAUL
          (after her)
     The Idiot.

INT. ST. PETER'S HALLWAY. DAY

Paul walks with Marge.

               PAUL 
     I'm in love with Libbets Casey.

               MARGE 
     Yeah, well, you've been in love
     with like every other girl here, I
     was wondering when you'd get around
     to Libbets.

               PAUL 
     It's beyond mere physical
     attraction.

               MARGE 
     That's good, because I don't think
     Libbets is capable of the sex act.

               PAUL 
     Truly? Do speak.

               MARGE 
     My diagnosis is messed in the head.
     A poor little rich girl -- I mean
     check out the jeans and fur look.
     And lend your ears to this
     brutality. Like her mom and step
     dad and her step-sisters are going
     to Switzerland to ski over
     Thanksgiving break -- and like they
     didn't invite her!

               PAUL
     How do you know this shit?

               MARGE 
     They did it last year too. It's
     like traditional or something.
     They've got this humongoid Park Ave
     apartment and she just holes up
     there with a wad of cash. 
          (beat)
     Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?

               PAUL 
          (pause)
     You think Francis is going to beat
     me to the punch here?

               MARGE 
     Since he sleeps with every girl you
     ever show an interest in, why don't
     you just keep your Libbets thing a
     secret from him?

               PAUL 
     Good thinking Marge.

INT. SCHOOL PARTY. NIGHT

Paul, Francis and friends enter the dark, crowded room.
Various kids are awkwardly dancing to some progressive fm
style undanceable rock (Jethro Tull, etc.) Francis hands Paul
the tail end of a joint, but Paul waves it away.

               PAUL 
     No more man. I'm about to drop as
     it is.

               FRANCIS 
     See ya.

               PAUL 
     Where you going?

               FRANCIS 
     Paul, let me enlighten you about
     something.
     You and I exist on two opposite
     sides of a great existential
     divide, that being your pathetic
     virginity on the one hand and my
     astonishing number of sexual
     conquests on the other. I'm off to
     get laid. See you.

               PAUL 
     Flame on, asshole.

               FRANCIS 
     And remember, with your erogenous
     zones lubricated as such with the
     mighty herb, do not attempt
     terrestrial contact with members of
     the opposite sex -- because you
     drone on like a motherfucker when
     you're stoned.

He waves his fingers toward Paul's eyes, in the classic
"stoned" gesture, then wanders off.

Paul looks on at the gathering. Marge waves to him from the
dance floor.

                              LATER:

INT. SCHOOL PARTY. CONT'D

Paul wanders, stoned, through the party. He sees Libbets from
across the room. She seems to be surrounded by friends.

INT. PARTY. CONT'D

Paul has cornered Libbets and is talking over the music.
There are just a few people left, most of them making out
with each other.

               PAUL 
          (stoned)
     -- because I've been reading
     Kerouac and Ginsberg and those guys
     were creating beat culture and
     traveling and sleeping wherever,
     and, of course, with all kinds of
     people, but when you read carefully
     the various contemporary accounts
     of their lives, and, uh, these guys
     didn't bathe much, I mean they were
     really filthy, with like genital
     crabs, lice, exceptionally strong
     body odor...

Libbets smiles through her yawn.

EXT. SCHOOL BENCH. NIGHT

Paul sits alone on the bench, freezing cold, eating a donut.
Some kids from across the lawn yell good-night to him.

INT. DORM ROOM. EVENING.

Paul is at his desk. Francis enters, wrapped in a towel,
fresh from the shower.

               PAUL 
     How can you do that man?

               FRANCIS 
     Do what?

               PAUL 
     Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's
     already getting dark outside, and
     you're just getting up.

               FRANCIS 
          (beat)
     Um, Libbets Casey.

               PAUL 
     What?

               FRANCIS 
     Aha! I could sense the vibe.

               PAUL 
     What do you mean?

               FRANCIS 
     Am I right or am I right?

               PAUL 
     Shit. You're not planning --

               FRANCIS 
     My man, I speak to you solely as a
     comrade in arms offering
     unconditional aid. I've been giving
     this one a lot of thought, and I
     believe that the two of you
     together might just reach that
     higher ground that --

A knock at the door.

               STUDENT  (O.S.)
     Hood, telephone.

Paul rolls off his bed, opens the door.

               PAUL 
     Don't mess with Libbets. I mean it!

INT. DORM HALLWAY. NIGHT

Paul walks to the pay phone at the end of the hall.

               PAUL 
     Hello?

INTERCUT - HOOD HOUSEHOLD. NIGHT

It's a modern (shag carpet, geometric-patterned wallpaper,
etc.) suburban house.

Ben Hood talks on the phone, a drink in his hand.

               BEN 
     Paul?

In the background, we can see Wendy watching Richard Nixon on
TV.

               PAUL 
     Hi dad.

               BEN 
     Hey guy. Things ok up there? You
     all right?

               PAUL 
     I'm fine dad.

               BEN 
     Well good. Just confirming. You'll
     be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.

               PAUL 
     Well dad, actually I thought I'd
     take the morning train on
     Thanksgiving -- got a lot of
     studying, papers, you know, lab
     experiments --

               BEN 
     Lab experiments? Right smart guy --
     Paul, you know your mother's gonna
     be disappointed not to see more of
     you -- In fact, let me make this
     more than a simple request guy, I
     think you should...

IN THE BACKGROUND:

               NIXON
          (on TV, from San Clemente
           press conference) 
     Well, with regard to the questions
     as to why Americans feel we were
     wrong to make the tapes, that is
     not particularly surprising. I
     think that most Americans do not
     like the idea of taping
     conversations and, frankly, it is
     not something that particularly
     appeals to me...

               BEN 
     Hold on for a second.
          (turning)
     Wendy, you want-to say hi to your
     brother?

She frowns.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     Come on!

She gets up sullenly and goes to the phone.

               WENDY 
     Charles.

               PAUL 
     Charles. Have you been keeping out
     of my shit? Have you refrained from
     entering the sacred precincts of my
     room?

               WENDY 
     I have not touched your sh--
          (looks at father)
     Stuff. You watching this?

               PAUL 
     Watching what?

               WENDY 
     Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He
     should be shot.

               BEN
          (overhearing)
     Hey, that's the president of the
     goddam United States you're talking
     about, Wendy!

From the kitchen, Elena overhears. She's dressed to go out,
but in the process of making a Kraft macaroni and cheese
dinner for Wendy.

               WENDY 
     He's a liar!
          (still talking more to her
           father than into the
           phone)
     Dean told him on March 21st about
     Kalmback and Hunt, all about the
     payoffs to the Watergate burglars,
     so you tell me where the so-called
     "Dean Report" is, but you can't
     because it doesn't exist, because
     he lied about Haldeman and
     Erlichman and the April 17 tape,
     that's why! Liar!

Ben retreats, going to the wet bar to pour another drink.

               BEN
          (muttering)
     OK, OK, the defense rests.
          (to Elena in the kitchen)
     Want another?

               ELENA (O.S.)
     No thank you. We should be off.

               BEN 
     Gotcha.

He puts the bottle back down without pouring.

INTERCUT BACK TO PAUL:

               PAUL
          (on the phone)
     Hey Charles. Charles, calm down --
     I wasn't in on it.

Elena, putting on her coat, comes into the den and gives
Wendy a kiss on the forehead as Wendy mumbles her good-byes
to Paul on the phone.

               ELENA 
     Dinner's on the counter. We'll be
     at the Williams's -- you know the
     number. 
          (takes the phone from
           Wendy)
     Paul. Hi. Is there anything you'll
     want, any particular kind of food
     or snack or anything we can stock
     up on?... You're all right? ... OK.
     See you next week. I love you.

Back to Nixon on the TV.

               NIXON 
     We must recognize that one excess
     begets another, and that the
     extremes of violence in the 1960s
     contributed to the extremes of
     Watergate...

On Wendy as she regards the TV, hearing her parents'
farewells as they leave through the front door.

EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. NIGHT

A large New England Colonial, with a few modern additions and
touches. We hear the sound of dinner chatter.

INT. WILLIAMS DINING ROOM. NIGHT

The kitchen door swings open into the dining room, and Mikey
and Sandy Williams emerge, each holding platters of food.
Mikey, 15-and-a-half, lost in space, and Sandy, 14, a sullen
and barely pubescent boy, each have towels draped over their
forearms -- they are the evening's "waiters".

They move unsteadily to the table, at which sit their parents
Janey (38, a hard-edged, sharp-witted beauty) and Jim (43,
large and a bit goofy, a genius inventor), together with
their guests, Ben and Elena Hood, and neighbors Dorothy and
Ted Franklin.

We jump cut through the evening's conversations, seen mostly
from the furtive POV's of the boys.

               BEN 
     His brother came back --

               DOROTHY 
     From where?

               BEN 
     Vietnam.

               DOROTHY 
     Oh. Are we going to talk about
     this, about...?

               ELENA 
     You should hear. It's very sad, he
     was --

                              JUMP CUT:

Janey is whispering something into Mikey's ear, who returns
to the kitchen.

               JIM 
     It was a benefit for the ACLU or
     something, and Harry Reems himself
     was there --

               DOROTHY 
     The man with the -- from Deep
     Throat?

               JIM 
     The very one -- something about a
     first amendment defense fund --
     well I believe in it --

               DOROTHY
     Ted took me to see it.

               JANEY 
     Ted, how romantic.

               DOROTHY
     I have to say, the movie didn't do
     much for me. But being in that
     theater, surrounded by all those
     horny young college boys and
     perverts, there was something in
     the air that --

                              JUMP CUT:

The boys are pouring wine.

               JIM 
     -- pulls right up to the pump,
     jumps out like there's no gas
     shortage, oblivious, and by this
     point everybody in line's piling
     out of their cars ready to kill the
     guy, when they notice it's that
     Reverend Edwards --

               BEN 
     The Unitarian? The new one?

               JIM 
     Yeah -- claims he pulled off Creek
     Road and didn't notice the line
     going back Mill Street for half a
     mile.

               BEN 
     He's either got his head in the
     clouds or up his --

               DOROTHY 
     I hear he's slept with half the
     women in his congregation --

               TED 
     Lucky bastard!

As this is said, Mikey accidentally spills some wine on Ben.

               BEN 
     Hell! -- I mean, no problemo there
     Mikey. Here, I --

Janey leans over with her napkin and attempts a cursory wipe
of Ben's pants. Is there a just barely noticeable frisson
between Ben and Janey as she removes the napkin? If there is,
Elena doesn't -- or pretends not to -- notice.

                              CUT TO:

The boys, now in pajamas (Sandy's with padded feet, Mikey's a
combination of t-shirt and pj bottoms) are bringing out
coffee and dessert. The adults eye Mikey's handling of the
coffee pot with some nervousness.

               DOROTHY
          (unconvincing)
     So fascinating. Do you get free
     tickets to the movies, that kind of
     thing?

               BEN 
     No, my job is just to analyze the
     entertainment stocks and advise our
     institutional investors on where to
     put their money. It's --

               ELENA 
     Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job
     that requires a certain prescience
     with regards to entertainment
     trends. You were the first to
     predict that Billy Jack would be a
     hit --

               BEN
          (with a bit too much
           conviction) 
     And as usual no one believed me...

Silence.

                              CUT TO:

The dinner party has moved to the living room for after
dinner drinks. Elena remains behind to help Janey pick up the
table. She stacks a plate on top of another.

               JANEY 
     Please don't.

               ELENA 
     It's not a bother.

               JANEY 
     I insist.
          (beat)
     Don't touch them.

Elena realizes that there's an edge to Janey's voice.

               ELENA 
     Oh.

               JANEY
          (realizing she's gone too
           far)
     It's really quite all right.

               ELENA 
     Of course.

INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

The party progresses. Mikey and Sandy are lying on their
stomachs at the top of the stairs, out of sight.

               DOROTHY 
     And to think -- they met at a key
     party of all things.

               ELENA 
     A key party?

               DOROTHY 
     You know, it's a California thing.
     That scuzzy husband of hers dragged
     her kicking and screaming to one
     when they were out in L.A. you
     know, the men put their car keys in
     a bowl, and then at the end of the
     evening the women line up and fish
     them out and go home with whoever's
     keys they've got. Anyhow that's how
     she met this Rod person or whatever
     his name is and he's left his wife
     and she's packing for California.
     Irwin is devastated. It's so
     ironic.

               JANEY
     Ironic? 

               DOROTHY
          (caught out)
     Well, um, yes. Ironic. His name is
     Rod.

INT. WILLIAMS FRONT HALLWAY. NIGHT

The guests are leaving. The men shake hands, the women kiss,
and the men and women awkwardly peck each others' cheeks.

               ELENA 
     Thank you Janey.

               DOROTHY 
     It was lovely!

               BEN 
     Hey Jim, next time you've got to
     fill me in on whatever it is you're
     up to these days.

               JIM 
     Will do.

INT. STAIRWAY. NIGHT

At the top of the stairs, a rather dejected Sandy and Mikey
finish spying on the leave-takings below. Mikey nudges Sandy,
and they silently head back the upstairs hall.

INT. MIKE'S ROOM. NIGHT

They enter Mike's room -- the door has a "nuclear waste 
positively no admittance" sign on it.

As Mikey reaches his bed, he doubles over, groaning, and
starts to make retching noises. He then throws himself onto
the bed, his head leaning over the far side.

Sandy walks over and sees a pile of vomit next to the bed.
Taken aback for a moment, he then reaches forward and picks
it up -- it's fake plastic vomit. He throws it on top of
Mike's back, but Mikey doesn't take notice.

               SANDY
     Stupid!
          (pause, looking sullenly
           at Mike's back)
     Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?

               MIKEY
          (not looking up, but
           alarmed)
     Who said so?

               SANDY
     No one.

               MIKEY
     I don't have a girlfriend.

Mikey returns to his reading -- a copy of The Sensuous Woman,
obviously well pawed over. He absentmindedly picks his nose.
As he flips the pages, a beautiful, almost electrical HUMMING
SOUND begins to fill his ears. He frowns and pauses to listen
to it.

Sandy, who has picked up a balsa wood miniature plane,
obviously doesn't hear it.

Mikey focuses on the plane as Sandy waves it through the air.
Perhaps the hum is the sound of its engines as it soars
through the sky...

INT. WENDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

There is a large poster of a cartoon version of Richard Nixon
"Tricky Dick" -- on her wall. Wendy is on the phone to her
friend Beth.

               WENDY 
     -- he knows that when the March
     24th tape -- you know with Dean,
     where Dean tells him that there's a
     cancer growing on the presidency --

She pauses as Beth asks a question.

               WENDY (CONT'D)
     Who? No way. He's like a big
     infected whitehead wearing jeans. I
     wouldn't --

She hears the downstairs door open.

               WENDY (CONT'D)
          (whispering)
     -- shit, it's my parents.

She turns her light out.

INT. HOOD UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. NIGHT

Ben and Elena walking past Wendy's room to their bedroom.

               BEN 
     You'd think she'd learn how to cook
     a chicken, eh? My drumstick was
     still frozen when you cut inside
     there. I'm probably going to get
     whatever that disease -- and Jim,
     how that guy ever became a
     millionaire --

He pauses before a hall table, and, with his eyes, traces the
telephone cord under Wendy's room.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     Hmm. I knew she'd still be up.
     Watch this --

But Elena simply continues into the master bedroom.

He starts to pull gently on the cord. And continues pulling.
No response for a few seconds. Then:

CONTINUED: 25

               WENDY (O.S.)
          (yelling behind her door)
     Dad stop it!

               BEN 
     Get to sleep young lady -- and I
     mean it.

Wendy opens the door to her room.

               WENDY 
     Fascist!

               BEN 
     If I were a fascist I would have
     sent you to one of those Southern
     military academies a long time ago.
     Now get to bed.

She slams the door.

He opens it.

INT. WENDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 

Ben enters the room, angry.

               BEN 
     Hey!

Wendy jumps into bed and under the covers, pulling them up
over her head. He stands over her, looking down at the
crumpled pile of sheet and blanket.

               BEN (CONT'D)
          (softening)
     Hey, kiddo. Sleep well, huh.

He places his hand where her cheek should be, and caresses
the sheet.

               WENDY
          (without pulling the sheet
           down, but nicely)
     Good-night dad.

               BEN 
     Good night kiddo.

Ben turns to the door, where he sees a silent Elena standing
in her nightgown, a slight smile on her face.

INT. HOOD BEDROOM. NIGHT

Elena is sitting cross-legged, eyes closed, on her side of
the bed. We hear the toilet flush from the master bath, and
see Ben emerge in his boxers. He pauses in front of the bed,
looking at Elena.

               ELENA
          (without opening her eyes)
     You're staring at me.

               BEN 
     I wasn't star--

               ELENA 
     I've been thinking, Ben, about
     Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd
     come with me sometime to meet Dr.
     Woolens.

               BEN 
     That shrink -- the one you always
     wanted me to see? I thought you
     dropped him.

               ELENA 
     I did, but -- somebody should
     probably see her, talk to her...
     You think she's ok?

               BEN 
     Why shouldn't she be?

Elena just gives him a look, more sad than angry.

               BEN (CONT'D)
          (pause)
     Then again, why should she be? I
     mean with us, with our...

               ELENA 
     So maybe you'll come too?

               BEN 
     Oh not again Elena! If we've got
     problems, why can't you just come
     out and talk about them.

               ELENA 
     It's you Ben who needs to talk.
     I've had my say, and I'm waiting to
     hear back from you.

               BEN 
     Yeah but Elena, even you don't
     believe all that "I'm OK. You're
     OK" stuff you keep babbling about --
     you say so yourself. I've been all
     ears for about ten years now on his
     subject, and --

               ELENA 
     -- And you haven't moved out yet.
     It's because you're too lazy, Ben.
     Too scared or lazy to either deal
     with us or simply make a decision --

               BEN 
     Elena.

Silence.

               ELENA 
          (sighing)
     Sleep in the study? Please.

Ben picks up a pillow and walks out, pausing wistfully at the
door.

               BEN 
     Good night.

               ELENA 
     Good night.

INT. WENDY'S ROOM. NIGHT

Wendy hears her parents' door close and sees a strip of light
illuminate under her door as the hall light goes on, then
off.

EXT. MANHATTAN OFFICE BUILDING. DAY

A nondescript, cleanly "modern" building. Engraved on the
doors: "Shackley and Schwimmer, Securities Brokerage -
Established 1964"

INT. SHACKLEY AND SCHWIMMER CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY

Ben, seated, is finishing a brief presentation to a small
group of men, which includes George Clair, mid-thirties,
unctuously handsome.

               BEN 
     But what, exactly, is stagflation,
     this mixture of inflation and
     stagnation, and how should we in
     the securities industry understand
     and accommodate it? Well -- and I
     hope I'm not out of bounds here -
     think of the money supply as a
     large male organ, continuously
     inflating, and yet, the societal
     vaginal cavity simply wants more.
     As the vicious circle of higher
     returns without real satisfaction
     continues, the money-organ may seem
     to be in demand, but in fact even
     the most inflated capital is
     unwanted. This is why I suggest
     that while we engage this mawing
     abyss for the highest returns, we
     at the same time fantasize, so to
     speak, of the safe harbor of
     capital appreciation.

The aging boss nods agreement.

               SHACKLEY
          (more or less mumbling)
     Brilliant, brilliant.

George Clair just grins.

INT. BEN HOOD'S OFFICE. DAY

Ben is gathering papers, readying to leave. He looks up to
see George Clair in his doorway.

               GEORGE 
     Hey there Benjie, you're becoming
     quite the in-house philosopher.
     When do you have time to think up
     all that stuff -- Shackley sure
     eats it up.

INTERCUT HALL IN FRONT OF BEN HOOD'S OFFICE

As we see that Clair is deftly fondling Hood's attractive
secretary as she is seated in the cubicle beside the door to
his office. She looks up coyly at Clair, hidden for the
moment from Ben's view.

Ben comes out of his office, pulling his coat on. Clair and
the secretary pull back, but it's clear that Ben has some
sense of what's transpiring between them.

               BEN 
     George, I'm just trying to get a
     global view of things -- can't just
     look at the small picture.

There's an obvious rivalry between the two of them.

               GEORGE 
     And speaking of which, you have
     those market share charts Mr.
     Shackley was asking about?

               BEN 
     Gotcha George, not a problem.
     Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start
     covering the old filmed
     entertainment sector yourself?

               GEORGE 
     Ben you know that's your territory 
     - and I wouldn't dream to trespass 
     - you're the expert. Hey, how do
     you think Paramount's gonna do with
     that Blatty novel, what's it
     called? The Exorcist?

               BEN 
     Overpriced bomb, cost over $6
     million -- no stars, and no one's
     into the horror genre these days
     anyway. I'm advising the company
     recommend reducing positions there.
     It's disaster films that are gonna
     stay at the top.

               GEORGE 
     Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a
     little early today?

               BEN 
     Got a meeting uptown.

               GEORGE
          (already moving off)
     Right o'.

               BEN 
     Up the organization!
          (then, to himself)
     Bastard.

The secretary pretends not to hear.

EXT. UNIVERSITY CLUB. DAY

An august New York institution. To establish.

INT. CLUB RESTAURANT. DAY

A stuffy, Ivy League atmosphere. A decades-old tradition of
serving overcooked American food. Ben is seated across from
his father, Harold Hood, a retired curmudgeon. There is a
walker parked by Harold's chair.

               HAROLD
          (waylaying a passing
           waiter) 
     I'd asked for that double martini
     about three hours ago!

               WAITER 
     Coming right up, sir.

               HAROLD 
     So asking me out for lunch -- what
     prompted this exceptional event? --
     Of course I'm paying.

               BEN 
     We don't have to always go to your
     club, dad.

               HAROLD 
     And why are you still calling me
     dad? You're forty years old
     already, and --

               BEN 
     -- Well what am I supposed to call
     you?

               HAROLD 
     That's besides the point.

The martini arrives, along with Ben's beer.

               BEN 
     I was actually trying to see about
     getting a little advice, you know --

               HAROLD 
     Advice? I'm supposed to be getting
     the stock tips from you, Ben.
     Unless - have you quit your job?
     They fired you?

               BEN 
     You know, dah--

He looks up and sees his father slurping his martini, not
paying attention.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     Actually it's not about work, it's
     advice about --

               HAROLD 
     Oh for crying out loud Ben, you
     don't mean to tell me that your
     marriage is going down the drain
     now --

               BEN 
     Well, Elena and I have kind of been
     talking, not really talking, but --

               HAROLD
     -- Your mother, God bless her,
     stood by me for forty-two years --
     we never once contemplated divorce 
     - I assume you're talking here
     about divorce? The very thought --

               BEN
     But dad, you guys truly hated each
     other, I mean really hated each --

               HAROLD 
     -- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad? 
          (back to Ben)
     You want advice Ben? If your big
     brother were still alive I'd have
     him go out into the back yard and
     beat some sense into your head.
     Look kid, you married that woman
     against my advice --

               BEN
     -- What advice? You never --

               HAROLD
     That's besides the point. The point
     is if I'd had any sense in me I'd
     have divorced your mother 40 years
     ago, and that's the truth, and here
     it is, 1972 --

               BEN
     -- 73

               HAROLD
     -- 73, and divorce is as easy as
     paying off a traffic ticket, and
     for crying out loud, Ben, be a man
     and just get it over with. I would
     have if I'd had the chance.

Ben ponders, as the food arrives.

               BEN 
          (weakly)
     But...

               HAROLD 
     But what?

               BEN 
     But I -- well maybe I love her.
     Elena.

His father rolls his eyes and stabs his salad with a fork.

               HAROLD 
     Christ Ben! Make up your mind and
     eat your lunch.

INT. BOOK STORE. DAY

Elena browses the self-help section. A longish-haired,
slightly gone-to-seed, but still handsome clergyman pauses
next to her. He's wearing an ecclesiastical collar and bell
bottoms.

He pulls out a copy of Me, Myself and I, glancing again at
Elena.

               PHILIP 
     Elena. Elena Hood, am I right?

               ELENA 
     Yes.

               PHILIP 
     Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards.
     You came by and checked out the
     congregation a couple of times last
     year.

               ELENA 
     Yes, it was -- I ended up --

               PHILIP
          (smiling)
     No need to make excuses --

EXT. NEW CANAAN HIGH SCHOOL FIELD. DAY

A cool gray afternoon. A group of boys are playing flag
football on the field, while two groups of girls are gathered
underneath the bleachers at either end, warily smoking
c1garettes.

Wendy, Beth, and a couple of other girls are gathered in one
group.

               BETH
          (referring to one of the
           girls gathered in the
           other group)
     She said you licked Dave Brewster's
     weenie in the third floor bathroom.

               WENDY 
     She's a liar. I wouldn't touch Dave
     Brewster's dick if you paid me.
     It's probably crawling with v.d.
     after he put it in her, which he
     did.

The conversation peters out at this point, as the two groups
of girls give each other the hairy eyeball from afar.

Wendy looks through from beneath the bleacher seats onto the
field where the boys are playing.

A group of boys break from a huddle, Mikey among them.

The quarterback takes the hike and Mikey runs out for a pass.
As he runs, his breathing increases in volume, filling his
ears, and transforming into the humming sound he'd heard
before.

The quarterback spots him and throws a long one.

He runs in an oblivion of beautiful white sound.

The ball drops next to him as he continues, in a world of his
own, to run.

Suddenly, the humming ends and he stops and turns around, to
see all the other kids just standing there looking at him.
One of them makes a pot-smoking gesture, as if that's the
explanation.

               MIKEY
          (as he returns to the
           group, ball in hand)
     Did anybody hear that?

The other kids snicker. Wendy looks on, and catches Mikey's
eye for a fleeting moment.

               WENDY 
     I gotta go.

She takes hold of her bicycle and pushes off.

INT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY

Elena and Philip are seated at a booth.

               PHILIP
     It's been a tremendously
     transformative year -- maybe a
     little controversial of course, but
     we're breaking down the old
     Unitarian barriers --

               ELENA 
     I suppose my reluctance was the
     group aspect of it -- I've never
     been much of a joiner, although I
     still consider myself a somewhat
     religious person --

               PHILIP 
     Well I of course flatter myself
     that our church is not exactly what
     most people would call organized
     religion -- at times it's the
     disorganization that's liberating --
     and of course I've begun to
     minister much more in what one
     might call therapeutic
     environments, in small groups, and
     one on one, couples --

Elena looks outside the window, and sees Wendy speed past on
her bicycle.

               ELENA 
          (cutting him off)
     My daughter. I haven't been on a
     bike for years.
          (still not really looking
           at him)
     When was the last time you rode a
     bike?

               PHILIP
          (a bit taken aback by the
           abrupt topic change)
     They say you never forget.

               ELENA
          (jarred back to his
           presence) 
     Forget what?

               PHILIP 
     Forget how to ride a bike.

Silence.

               ELENA 
     No, of course you don't, you're
     right.

EXT. FIVE AND DIME STORE. DAY

Wendy pulls her bike up to the back, locks it, and walks in.

INT. FIVE AND DIME STORE. DAY

Wendy moves with a certain amount of stealth through the
aisles, arriving at the candy selection.

She looks around.

She takes a package of twinkies and slips them into the
oversized pockets of her painter's pants.

She turns around, and her breath goes out of her -- an OLD
WOMAN has been watching her shoplift. The woman looks sadly
at her, but says nothing. Wendy slowly walks past her and out
the back door of the store. The woman looks on.

EXT. FIVE AND DIME STORE. DAY

As she walks her bike onto the sidewalk, Wendy comes across
Sandy.

               SANDY
     Hey Wendy.

               WENDY
     Hey Sandy.

               SANDY
     Mikey was looking for you.

               WENDY
     Yeah? See ya.

She pushes off on her bike.

Sandy gazes after her. He takes his G.I. Joe out of his coat
pocket, and points it at her.

               SANDY 
     Bam.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS. DAY

Wendy flies along on her bike. It's a desolately beautiful
fall day.

EXT. SILVER MEADOWS PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE. DAY

Wendy rides by the front gates of the posh grounds of the
private psychiatric clinic. A security guard leans against a
booth.

Once a bit past the gate, she gets off her bike and walks it
into a grove of trees near the front drive.

EXT. SILVER MEADOWS. DAY

Mikey is waiting amid the trees next to his bike as Wendy
arrives.

               MIKEY 
     Want some gum?

               WENDY 
     Sure.
          (pulling them out of her
           pocket)
     Twinkie?

               MIKEY
          (opens his mouth,
           displaying the gum on his
           tongue)
     I'm chewing.

She puts the Twinkies back, and pops the gum in her mouth.

They stand together chewing.

               WENDY
          (after a pause)
     Did you tell Sandy?

               MIKEY 
     Tell Sandy? What?

Wendy doesn't say anything.

               MIKEY (CONT'D)
     You didn't tell him either, did
     you?

EXT. SILVER MEADOWS SWIMMING POOL. DAY

The wind is picking up and the light is fading. Mikey and
Wendy climb the fence around the pool, which is empty and
half-covered in dead leaves and twigs.

They climb down into the concrete recess and walk into the
deep end, leaning against the far wall of the pool.

They each matter-of-factly take their gum out and put it
behind their ears.

They begin not so much to kiss as to place their tongues in
each others' mouths.

We see them from high above the pool, as the dead leaves
swirl lightly around them, Mikey groping under Wendy's
poncho.

EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. DAY

To establish.

INT. WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM. DAY

A couple are in the final throes of lovemaking. We see Janey
Williams's face, more or less enjoying the proceedings. The
man gives a final heave and groan, and rolls off to reveal
himself to be -- Ben Hood.

                              JUMP CUT TO:

Janey smokes a cigarette. Ben is babbling.

               BEN
     We were golfing, and you know,
     golfing to me is something I'm
     supposed to enjoy, and I was on the
     goddam golf team in college, so
     it's something one would assume I
     do well -- I used to do well -- but
     basically these days golfing for me
     is like hoeing, or plowing.

Janey smiles briefly at this.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     It's like farming. I am basically
     chewing up large tracts of
     expensively landscaped scenery with
     overpriced sticks, and George Clair
     has obviously, in the mere two
     years since he joined the firm, he
     has obviously been taking secret
     lessons with a golf pro, and I
     assume the entirety of his
     disposable income has been devoted
     to humiliating me on the golf
     course. And the guy talks -
     incessantly -- throughout the
     entirety of the miserable 18 holes 
     - on topics that are the supposed
     domain of my department --

               JANEY
     Ben--

               BEN
     Yeah?

               JANEY
          (gently)
     You're boring me. I have a husband.
     I don't particularly feel the need
     for another.

               BEN
     You have a point there. That's a
     very good point. We're having an
     affair. Right. An explicitly sexual
     relationship. Your needs. My needs.
     You're absolutely right.

               JANEY
     You should probably get dressed.
     The boys will be home soon.

               BEN
     Gotcha.

She wraps a blanket around herself and gets up.

EXT. BACK OF WILLIAMS HOUSE. EVENING

Ben cautiously walks out he back door and heads for the side
gate.

INT. HOOD KITCHEN. EVENING

Wendy enters the house as Elena is finishing supper
preparations.

               WENDY 
     Hi mom.

               ELENA 
     Hi Wendy.

Without waiting for instructions, Wendy starts pulling out
plates and silverware and setting the table.

               ELENA (CONT'D)
     I saw you on your bike today.

               WENDY 
     With Mikey?

               ELENA 
     Who?

               WENDY 
     Nobody.

               ELENA 
     Mikey Williams?

               WENDY 
     We were just riding around.

Elena takes this in.

               ELENA 
     Well, you looked very -- free --
     when I saw you.

Wendy continues setting the table.

               ELENA (CONT'D)
     Weightless almost -- as if I were
     seeing my own memories of being a
     girl. There was something internal
     about it.

               WENDY 
     Mom. Are you ok?

               ELENA 
     Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You
     must think I'm ripe to be checked
     into Silver Meadows.

               WENDY 
     You're not a psycho!

               ELENA 
     The people at Silver Meadows aren't
     psychos.

               WENDY 
     I know. They're rich drug addicts
     and celebrities. When I saw James
     Taylor there, and --

               ELENA 
     We've been through this Wendy 
     James Taylor was actually at that
     clinic up near Boston.

               WENDY 
     Well, I saw what I saw, and if you
     don't want to believe me --

               ELENA 
     Oh Wendy.

Wendy frowns.

               WENDY 
     They need the money for my band
     uniform at school.

               ELENA 
     I thought you quit the band - I
     never hear you practice anymore.

               WENDY 
     I don't really need to practice. I
     just play a few notes, you know, so
     I thought maybe I'd stay in.

               ELENA 
     Well, I'm sure your father and I
     would love to hear what you're
     playing these days. Maybe after
     dinner.

INT. HOOD LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

Ben and Elena take their seats on the sofa. Wendy stands
before them holding an enormous trombone, with a music stand
and sheet music in front of her.

She puffs a series of seemingly disconnected notes in waltz
time.

When she's done, she looks up from the sheet music to her
parents.

They applaud.

               BEN
     Can't wait to see how it fits in
     with all the other instruments.

Elena gives him a look.

INT. HOOD KITCHEN. NIGHT

Elena is sorting through bills and writing checks at the
kitchen table. Ben comes in and fills a glass with ice.

               ELENA
     The Halfords have invited us again
     this year.

               BEN
     You want to go?

               ELENA
     What do you think?

               BEN
     Well, it is a neighborhood
     tradition.

He comes up behind her, looks down at the checkbook.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     I'm, uh, going to bed.

               ELENA
     So early?

               BEN
     Rough day. Good night.

He leans over and kisses her on the cheek. She sniffs.

               ELENA
     Is that a new aftershave?

He recoils a bit.

               BEN 
     Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You
     like it?

               ELENA 
     Hmm. Good night.

He walks uncertainly from the room. Does she suspect?

INT. MIKE'S ROOM. NIGHT

Mikey is painfully at work writing an English essay. Sandy
comes to the door with a geometry textbook.

               SANDY 
     Mikey?

               MIKEY 
     Yeah?

               SANDY 
     Geometry?

               MIKEY 
     Sure, anything but this English.

Sandy puts the open textbook in front of him.

               SANDY 
     Why are you so good at math but not
     in English?

               MIKEY 
     I'm not good at math. Just
     geometry.

He looks at the book.

               MIKEY (CONT'D)
          (drawing out his examples
           on a piece of paper) 
     It's like, you know when they say
     "two squared"? And you think it
     means 2 times 2, equals 4? But
     really they really mean a square. A
     square with a side of two. And the
     area of the square is four. Like
     every time you use the word, like
     squared, or cubed, it's really
     space, it's not numbers, it's
     space.
     And it's perfect space, but only in
     your head, because you can't draw a
     perfect square, like in the
     material world, but in your mind,
     you can have perfect space.
          (pause)
     You know?

As Mikey goes on, we see his geometric doodles, and hear
faintly the HUMMING SOUND under his voice.

               SANDY
     Yeah. But I just need some help
     with my homework.

A knock at the door. Jim stands in the doorway with a
suitcase in his hand.

               JIM 
     Hey guys, I'm back.

               MIKEY
          (honestly confused)
     You were gone?

Sandy looks at Mikey as if pondering a lost cause.

               JIM
          (a look of
          disappointment) 
     Yeah Mikey. Yep, I was in Houston,
     working on some great new ideas
     about silicon, which comes from
     sand, very conductive. How you guys
     doing? How's school?

Mikey's still flustered.

               MIKEY 
     Uh, I dunno. OK I guess.

               JIM 
     Hmm. Alright!

He walks off.

               SANDY 
     You really didn't notice? Man, he's
     been gone for three days.

INT. WILLIAMS BEDROOM. NIGHT

Janey is reading, still dressed, on the bed. She nods to Jim
as he enters with his suitcase.

               JANEY 
     Good trip?

He nods and puts his suitcase down, then sits heavily on the
side of the bed.

               JIM
          (as he sits)
     You bet.

It turns out it's a water bed, and his weight creates a wave
that nearly pushes Janey off her edge of the bed.

               JANEY 
     Jesus, Jim!

               JIM
          (jumping up, which only
           creates another wave)
     Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to
     trade this thing in for a normal
     bed.

               JANEY 
     Just be careful.

               JIM
          (as he begins to unpack)
     You notice anything with Mikey
     lately? The kid seemed a little out
     of it tonight, eh?

               JANEY 
     Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it
     since he was born.

               JIM 
     Hell, I guess he takes after me,
     huh?

He laughs to himself.

She gives him a look.

INT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY

Elena and Philip Edwards are having coffee again.

               PHILIP 
     In many ways, the church-bound
     tradition of the father, son, and
     holy ghost is simply a version of
     the parent-child-adult triad within
     us all. It's a primitive set of
     symbols for our inner psychology.

               ELENA 
     You're saying that Christ is the
     child, and --

               PHILIP 
     -- And God the angry parent, and
     the Spirit the hope of an
     integrated adult self.

               ELENA 
     All well and good -- But tell me
     again what is it exactly that you
     believe in?

               PHILIP 
     You ask what the point is?

               ELENA 
     That's right.

               PHILIP 
     Self-realization. Ministering to
     help people reach their fullest
     potential. Would you believe me if
     I told you I want you to see
     yourself reach your fullest
     potential and self-realization?

               ELENA 
     I would say it sounds like you're
     trying to get me into bed.

               PHILIP 
     If that's a potential you see
     yourself fulfilling... I mean... 
          (flustered)
     My, I sound a bit --

               ELENA 
     I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I
     didn't mean to be so rude.

               PHILIP 
     You weren't. You actually, for some
     reason, you have the effect on me
     of making me feel just a tiny bit
     ashamed of myself.

               ELENA 
     But not too ashamed.

               PHILIP 
          (smiling)
     Now you are being rude.

               ELENA 
     And you're still trying to get me
     into bed.

               PHILIP 
     Ouch.

Just then, Dorothy Franklin passes by their table, a smirk
firmly implanted on her face.

               DOROTHY 
     Hello you two. Am I barging in on
     some kind of religious study group?
     Elena, you look marvelous. Will I
     see you and Ben at the Halford's?

               ELENA 
     I suppose we'll make an appearance.

               DOROTHY 
     And Reverend Edwards? Did you make
     the list?

               PHILIP 
          (laughing)
     I believe so Mrs. Franklin.

               DOROTHY 
     With the two of you there it will
     be positively a revival! I'm off!

She scurries out of the coffee shop.

               PHILIP 
     I'm afraid she's something of a
     gossip, isn't she?

               ELENA
          (gathering her things to
           go)
     I'm afraid people around here
     provide her with quite a bit to
     gossip about. 
          (getting up)
     Take care.

               PHILIP 
     That I will indeed.

INT. CLASSROOM. DAY

Mikey is reading his English paper before the class.

               MIKEY 
     Because of molecules we are
     connected to the outside world from
     our bodies. Like when you smell
     things, because when you smell a
     smell it's not really a smell, it's
     a part of the object that has come
     off of it -- molecules. So when you
     smell something bad, it's like in a
     way you're eating it. This is why
     you should not really smell things,
     in the same way that you don't eat
     everything in the world around you 
     - because as a smell, it gets
     inside of you. So the next time you
     go into the bathroom after someone
     else has been there, remember what
     kinds of molecules you are in fact
     eating.

An embarrassed silence.

INT. SCHOOL MUSIC ROOM. DAY

Band practice. The New Canaan High School band is doing a
wind version of a popular rock tune.

In front, there's Wendy, in halter top and hip-hugging bell
bottoms, incongruously blowing away on her trombone -- this
being her one stab at extracurricular activities.

In the flute section directly behind her is Sandy, piping
away on a tiny piccolo. He sits on a riser slightly elevated
above her.

He directs downward at Wendy a protracted regard, a look of
intense concentration on his face.

SANDY'S POV:

Wendy's backside, her pants pushed outward in the back,
affording Sandy a libido-charged view of the top of her bum
crack.

Push in on a close-up of this cherished abstract landscape,
then back to Sandy's furrowed face.

INT. CLUB RESTAURANT. DAY

Ben and Harold are at their table again. Lunch is being
cleared.

               HAROLD
     It's not the taxes I object to.
     It's all the fines and penalties.

               BEN 
     Alright dad. But you sold the
     house, you didn't tell anyone,
     including the IRS, and I'd of
     certainly liked to have seen if
     there was any old stuff --

               HAROLD 
     It was all junk!

Another pause. Ben decides not to pursue an overworked topic.

               BEN 
     Oh. Elena wanted to know when we
     could expect you on Thanksgiving.
     It's just going to be you this
     year.

               HAROLD 
     Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate
     Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I
     have a new nurse. She's a negro,
     she weighs three hundred pounds,
     and I've decided to leave my entire
     estate to her.

Ben spits his drink out.

               BEN 
     What?

               HAROLD 
     Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as
     gullible as ever.

               BEN 
     That was a joke? You don't tell
     jokes.

               HAROLD 
     I thought I'd start trying. If you
     don't mind. But I am going to
     Florida and I do have a new nurse.

INT. TRAIN. EVENING

Ben sits in the moving train, commuting home. He puts down
his paper to look at this fellow passengers. [NOTE: He is in
the same seat as was Paul at the beginning of the film.]

INT. HOOD DEN. DAY

Elena sits in a yoga pose.

INT. HOOD GARAGE. DAY

Elena enters the garage from the kitchen and turns the light
on.

She finds an old bicycle and pulls it out.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS. DAY

Elena rides her bike into town, infused with the girlish
sense of freedom she imagined for her daughter.

Suddenly, there's a pop -- a tire is blown out. She slows
down and gets off the bike. As she bends to look at the
wheel, a station wagon slows near her. The driver's side
window rolls open. It's Janey Williams.

               JANEY 
     Need a lift?

INT. JANEY'S CAR. DAY

Elena sits in the passenger seat. The two women are obviously
uncomfortable with each other.

Silence.

               ELENA 
     Thanks again. For the dinner.

               JANEY 
     Thanks for eating it. I don't know
     why I even pretend I can cook.

               ELENA 
     I used to know how to cook.

               JANEY 
     It's not like we're too busy.

They smile, barely.

               ELENA 
     I'm thinking of going back to
     school.

               JANEY 
     Social work?

               ELENA 
     How'd you know?

               JANEY 
     Educated guess.

               ELENA 
     I'm that predictable? No, you don't
     have to answer that. It's just that
     with the kids almost grown --

               JANEY 
     You don't have to apologize. I'm
     too much of a cynic. You actually
     seem to be trying to figure things
     out -- don't mind me.

She pulls the car over.

EXT. FIVE AND DIME STORE. DAY

Janey's car pulls to the curb.

INT. CAR. CONT'D

               JANEY
     Here you are.

               ELENA
          (opening her door)
     Thanks for the lift. If the bike's
     any bother--

               JANEY 
     None at all. I'll leave it in front
     of your garage. Happy Thanksgiving.

EXT. FIVE AND DIME. CONT'D

Elena watches the car pull away. She turns and walks into the
store.

INT. FIVE AND DIME. DAY

Elena moves through the aisles, putting various sundries into
a basket.

She pauses in front of the lipsticks.

She picks up a lipstick, looks at it, then quietly places it
in her pocket.

We see her reflection in the security mirror above the aisle,
as she quickly exits the store.

The middle-aged lady behind the counter watches her leave.

EXT. FIVE AND DIME. DAY

In a wide shot, from across the street, we see Elena leave
the store, followed by the shopkeeper who runs behind her and
taps her on the shoulder. They converse for a minute, and
Elena is accompanied back into the store.

Through the store windows we see her take the lipstick out of
her purse. She's obviously distraught -- offering to pay,
talking quickly, etc. The shopkeeper is holding a telephone,
not yet decided on whether to call her in.

               PAUL (V.O.)
     To find yourself in the Negative
     Zone, as the Fantastic Four often
     do, means that all everyday
     assumptions are inverted -- even
     the invisible girl herself becomes
     visible, and so she loses the last
     semblance of her power.

INT. TRAIN. DAY

Close on images from The Fantastic Four.
     "HERE IN THE NEGATIVE ZONE, HIS
     POWERS ARE HALVED. WE CAN DO
     NOTHING BUT WAIT... AND PRAY" "BUT
     WHAT ABOUT FRANKLIN? HE'LL BE
     KILLED!"

Paul sits reading on his way home.

EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. DAY

Janey pulls up in the driveway. As she gets out of the car,
she hears a small explosion from the back of the house.

EXT. HOOD BACKYARD. DAY

Janey comes around the back to discover Sandy stuffing a
model airplane with m-80 firecrackers. He lights them and
runs back a safe distance. The plane explodes, its wreckage
joining the debris from a few other dolls, models, and toys.

               JANEY 
     Sandy!

Sandy looks up -- busted.

Janey marches over to him.

               JANEY (CONT'D)
     You little idiotic prick, you could
     blow yourself fucking sky high with
     all this demented crap.

Sandy looks on the verge of tears. She softens and bends down
to him.

               JANEY (CONT'D)
          (sighing)
     Hey.
          (picking up the
           firecrackers)
     I'll take this stuff.

               SANDY
     You going to tell dad?

               JANEY
     Would it matter?
          (sees something else lying
           on the ground)
     And what's that?

               SANDY
          (sniffling)
     You know, it's the whip -- the one
     uncle Frank got me from Mexico.

               JANEY
     It's not packed with explosives, is
     it?

               SANDY 
     No!

               JANEY
          (going into the house)
     Play with the whip.

INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. DAY

Mikey and Wendy are in front of the TV, watching a rerun of
Divorce Court.

               JANEY
     Oh. Hi Wendy.

               WENDY
     Hi Mrs. Williams.

               JANEY
     Mikey, have you heard the
     explosions coming from the
     backyard?
          (he stares blankly at her)
     Do you know what Sandy's been up
     to?

               MIKEY
          (honestly oblivious, as
           usual)
     I dunno.

She pauses, then walks into the kitchen.

EXT. WILLIAMS BACKYARD. DAY

Sandy flicks his enormous whip in the direction of a small
bush.

One by one, he snaps off its leaves.

INT. WILLIAM KITCHEN. DAY

Janey hauls a turkey out of a bag and into the fridge.

INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. DAY

Mikey and Wendy are still in front of the TV.

Janey comes in again and looks at them.

               JANEY
     Don't you kids have homework?

               MIKEY AND WENDY 
          (without looking up, in
           unison)
     Thanksgiving break.

She walks out of the room again.

Sandy comes in, whip in hand, looks over at Mikey and Wendy,
then walks over to them, and, without a word, slumps down
beside them and watches the TV.

EXT. TOWN STREET. DAY

Elena walks unsteadily, pausing to rest against a brick wall.
She takes a deep breath, then walks to a corner where a local
taxi station wagon sits idling. She gestures to the driver,
who beckons her in.

INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. DAY

Later, still mentally devolving in front of the TV, but with
various junk food detritus surrounding them and a different
show, a rerun of the original Highway Patrol.

Sandy wanders off.

                              CUT TO:

Later.

Wendy gets up, goes upstairs, and wanders down the hall to
the bathroom.

She gets to the door just as Sandy gets there from the
opposite direction.

               WENDY 
     After you.

Sandy hesitantly opens the door, as Wendy still hovers by it.

               SANDY 
     Well, you can...

               WENDY 
     Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up
     out there? Your mom was pretty
     p.o.'d.

               SANDY 
     All my model planes.

               WENDY 
     The ones you built?

               SANDY
     They were old. And they couldn't
     fly anyhow. I'm going to get a
     radio-controlled airplane at
     Christmas, and then I'll stuff it
     full of m-80s and then fly it into
     Mrs. Burgess's English class and
     blow it up.

               WENDY 
     I have to go to the bathroom.

               SANDY 
     Yeah.

But he stays put, unaware it seems that he's blocking the
doorway.

Wendy looks around -- no one in sight.

               WENDY 
     I'll show you mine if you show me
     yours.

Sandy goes wide eyed, and almost against his will backs into
the bathroom like a feather.

INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. DAY

Mikey looks up from the TV, wondering where Wendy is. He eats
another Pringle.

INT. WILLIAMS BATHROOM. DAY

Wendy flips up her dress for Sandy.

He slowly unzips, his hand unsteady. We can tell from the
look on Wendy's face that she's feeling a bit sorry for the
little guy.

Suddenly Sandy turns beet red, and bursts into tears.

               SANDY 
     What do you want?! What do you
     want? Get out! Get out of here!

The door flips open -- and Janey Williams appears.

               JANEY
          (sizing up the situation) 
     Shit.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM. DAY

Janey is giving Wendy a lecture

               JANEY 
     A person's body is his temple,
     Wendy. This body is your first and
     last possession. Now as your own
     parents have probably told you, in
     adolescence our bodies tend to
     betray us. That's why, in Samoa and
     in other developing nations,
     adolescents are sent out into the
     woods, unarmed, and they don't come
     back until they've learned a thing
     or two.

INT. WILLIAMS HOUSE DOORWAY. DAY

Wendy is led to the door by Mrs. Williams.

Wendy trades a glance with a sullen Mikey, who sits in the
living room pretending to ignore her.

EXT. STREET. DAY

Wendy walks her bike with the wind in her face.

From behind her, Mikey rides up on his bike and rides
alongside her.

She doesn't look at him.

Trying to stay on his bike, but moving slowly, he wobbles,
nearly falling off.

               MIKEY 
     I don't ever want to see you.

               WENDY 
     Then why'd you come after me?

EXT. HOOD HOUSE. DAY

The taxi pulls up. Elena gets out and pays the driver.

INT. HOOD KITCHEN. DAY

Ben is in front of the open freezer, trying to get something
out. He hears Elena come in the front door.

               BEN 
     Elena. I need some help here if
     this thing's gonna defrost by
     tomorrow.

She comes up and together they tug and pull until they
succeced in extracting a large, frozen turkey. As they pull
it out, it slips from their hands and, after a dull thump,
slides along the floor.

They smile.

Elena bends over to pick it up. Ben observes her. She notices
his look.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     Here.

He goes over and picks up the turkey, placing it in the sink.
He looks back at her and notices her vaguely distraught look.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     You all right there?

               ELENA 
     Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to
     pick up the cranberry sauce?

               BEN
     Um, yes.

They stand together, his concern and her vulnerability
forming an awkward attraction between them.

               ELENA 
     Because you like it on your turkey
     sandwiches.

               BEN 
     I do. I'm -- are you...?

               ELENA 
     I... I think I am...

               BEN 
          (pause)
     You know Elena, I've been thinking--

               ELENA
     Ben, maybe no talking right now? If
     you start talking, you're going to--

She kisses him as if she needed him.

INT. HOOD HALLWAY. DAY

Ben and Elena enter their bedroom. Elena closes the door
quietly behind her.

INT. HOOD BEDROOM. DAY

Ben and Elena undress shyly.

They make love. Elena's face is almost fearful.

                              CUT TO:

Elena and Ben lie in bed side by side in the pale afternoon
light. Neither speaks. Ben turns on his side, and notices a
small tear forming in Elena's eyes.

               BEN 
     You crying?

               ELENA 
     I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it
     was... you were, but, you know. I
     just don't know...

               BEN
          (gently making light)
     Whatever that means Elena -- And
     you complain about me not
     communicating... I thought it was --

               ELENA 
     No, I didn't mean to sound
     negative. It was -- But Ben. 
          (beat)
     What is going to happen with us?
     Have you --

               BEN 
     You have to bring this up now?
     What? Did I do something here? Is
     that it? Is it something I did?

               ELENA 
     I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's
     just that we've got to be honest.
     Not just with ourselves, but with
     the children.

               BEN
          (pause, sitting up)
     Hell, I know. I -- I guess if you
     want to accuse me, you've got --
          (looks at watch)
     Oh hell! I've got to pick up Paul.
     I almost forgot.

He gets up and starts to get dressed.

               ELENA
     You were saying?

He smells the armpits of the shirt he's putting on.

               BEN
     Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this
     thing to the Halford's Friday.

               ELENA
     That shirt?

               BEN
     What?

               ELENA
     Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.

He looks at her ruefully.

EXT. HOOD STREET. DAY

Wendy walks and Mikey rides along.

               WENDY
     You have to follow me?

               MIKEY
     I dunno. I --

They're now in front of the Hood's house.

EXT. HOOD HOUSE. DAY

Ben exits the house in a rush, and sees Wendy and Mikey on
the street in front.

               BEN
     Hey there Mikey, how's business?

CONTINUED: 85

               MIKEY
          (tripping off of his bike)
     Business? Uh, I dunno.

Ben grimaces, fiddles for his car keys.

As Mikey remounts and rides off, Wendy passes her father on
the driveway.

               BEN
     I'm picking up Paul at the station 
     - want to come?

               WENDY
     Nah.

               BEN
     What you been up to?

               WENDY
     Nothing.

INT. HOOD LIVING ROOM. DAY

Wendy enters the house and climbs the stairs.

She sees the crumpled bed sheets in her parents' room and
hears Elena in the shower.

EXT. NEW CANAAN STATION. DAY

Paul walks to the parking lot with his father, who carries
his duffel bag.

EXT. STREETS. DAY

Ben's car heading back to the house with Paul.

INT. HOOD CAR. DAY

               BEN
     So how's school treating you?

               PAUL
     All right.

               BEN 
     Classes?

               PAUL
     Good.

               BEN 
     Grades?

               PAUL
     Fine.

               BEN 
     Anyone special? You know...

               PAUL
     Hnnn.

               BEN 
     Well it's good to see you -- we
     miss you around the house and all,
     but this St. Peter's, it's top of
     the line, eh?

               PAUL
     Yeah.

               BEN 
     You know Paul, I've been thinking,
     maybe this is as good a time as any
     to have a little talk, you know,
     about -- well --

He makes a sharp turn. Paul puts his arms up on the dashboard
to steady himself.

               PAUL
          (nervous)
     About?

               BEN 
     Well, the whole gamut. Facts of
     life and all. Some fatherly advice,
     because, I tell you, there's things
     happening that you're probably old
     enough... well...
          (pause)
     For example, on the self-abuse
     front -- now this is important -
     it's not advisable to do it in the
     shower -- it wastes water and
     electricity and because we all
     expect you to be doing it there in
     any case -- and, um, not onto the
     linen, and not on your sister's
     underwear or any clothing belonging
     to your mother --

He pauses to gauge the effect of his monologue on his son,
then continues.

               PAUL 
     Uh, Dad --

Just then Ben runs a stop sign and almost slams into another
car.

               BEN 
     Holy! Well. If you're worried about
     anything, just feel free to ask,
     and, uh, we can look it up.

               PAUL 
     Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.

               BEN 
     All the more reason for this little
     heart to heart... great.

EXT. HOOD HOUSE. DAY

The car pulls up. Paul gets out, looking shell-shocked. He
sees Wendy waving to him from a second floor window. He nods
back.

               BEN 
     Um, Paul. On second thought, can
     you do me a favor and pretend I
     never said any of that.

               PAUL 
     Sure dad.

               BEN 
     Thanks.

In the doorway, Elena waits.

INT. HOOD HALLWAY. DAY

Paul knocks on Wendy's bedroom door. She opens it.

               PAUL 
     Hello, Charles.

               WENDY 
     Greetings, Charles.

INT. WENDY'S ROOM. DAY

Paul and Wendy sit on the floor.

               PAUL 
     How are the parental units
     functioning these days?

               WENDY 
     Dad's like doing his Up With People
     routine, mom hasn't been saying
     much.

               PAUL 
     I don't know. Dad seems a little
     weird.

               WENDY 
     Yeah well wait till mom opens her
     mouth.

They both ponder silently. Then:

               PAUL 
     May I operate your telephonic
     apparatus?

               WENDY 
     Why don't you use the phone
     downstairs?

               PAUL 
     Calling an individual, Charles, in
     New York. Confirming a social
     outing for Friday night.

               WENDY 
     Can I come?

               PAUL
     It's a one-on-one kind of date
     thing.

               WENDY
     With who?

               PAUL
     Her name's Libbets.

               WENDY
     Libbets? What kind of a name is
     Libbets?

EXT. HOOD HOUSE. DAY

Morning. To establish.

INT. HOOD BEDROOM. DAY

Elena is coming out of the master bathroom in a robe, a towel
wrapped around her head.

               ELENA
     The turkey in?

               BEN
     Stuffed and baking.

INT. HOOD HALLWAY. DAY

Ben Hood pads down the hall in his bathrobe, tries the
bathroom door. It's locked.

               BEN
     Anyone home?

INT. HOOD BATHROOM. DAY

The shower is running, but Paul is standing by the open
window, puffing on a joint and trying to blow the smoke
outside.

               PAUL
     I'll be out in a second.

Ben walks back to the bedroom, smirking.

               BEN 
     Sure you will.

INT. HOOD DINING ROOM. DAY

One by one, each member of the Hood carried in a final item
to place on the overstuffed Thanksgiving table. Then, one by
one, they each silently take their seats.

They look over the table. No one moves.

               BEN 
     Well, it's great we can all be
     together. And this Thanksgiving, no
     hysteria, no yelling, especially
     with grandpa not here, although we
     miss him. So let's do it right and
     actually, Wendy, why don't you say
     grace. You used to love to say
     grace, remember.

Wendy grimaces, as they all bow their heads slightly.

               WENDY 
     Dear Lord, thank you for
     Thanksgiving, and for letting us
     white people kill all the
     Indians...

Everyone looks up.

               WENDY (CONT'D)
     ... and steal their tribal lands
     and stuff ourselves like pigs

Mutterings and groans: "Wendy!" "For Christ's sake" etc.

               WENDY (CONT'D)
     ... while children in Africa and
     Asia are napalmed and --

               BEN 
     Jesus all right enough!

They all unceremoniously start to dig in.

                              FADE OUT:

INT. WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM. DAY

Janey Williams is pouring Benjamin Hood a drink from a bottle
of vodka. Benjamin is already unbuttoned and shoeless; Janey
still fully dressed.

               JANEY 
     Here.

               BEN 
     After the Thanksgiving I had, I
     need it. You having one?

               JANEY 
     In a bit.

She sits next to him, he kisses the back of her neck.

               BEN 
     You know, I think Elena might
     suspect something.

Janey gives him a rather contemptuous look.

               BEN (CONT'D)
          (thinking aloud)
     Maybe it's all for the better, you
     know?
     Yesterday, at dinner, well, she
     hasn't said anything... has she
     acted funny to you, I mean, have
     you noticed anything?

               JANEY
          (almost ironic)
     Have I noticed anything? I'm not
     married to her Benjamin, you are. I
     think you've probably a better
     vantage point from which to observe
     her.

               BEN 
     Yeah, but, I -- I've been working a
     lot lately, and -- No, that's not
     it. I guess we've just been on the
     verge of saying something, whatever
     it is, just saying something to
     each other. On the verge.

Janey gets up.

               JANEY 
     I'll be back.

Benjamin looks at her quizzically.

               BEN
     Huh?

               JANEY
     Birth control.

               BEN
     Right. Gotcha.

She leaves the room.

He leans back onto the bed. Sits back up. Takes a sip of
vodka. Puts the glass down. Takes his socks off. He's now in
just his jockey shorts and shirt.

Faintly, he hears a door close. The front door?

He takes another sip.

He hears another sound.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     Janey?

Nothing.

He goes to the door and carefully opens it.

               BEN (CONT'D)
          (quietly)
     Janey?

He hears, quite audibly, a car door open, close, Janey's car
start and pull out.

He runs to a front window just in time to catch a glimpse of
her driving off.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     Shit.

INT. GUEST ROOM. LATER

Benjamin sits on the guest bed, still in his underwear,
drinking from the bottle.

He gets up and starts to wander around the house, still
holding the bottle.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM. CONT'D

Benjamin saunters through. He presses on the king-sized bed --
it undulates.

               BEN
     Water bed! Dig it!

He wiggles comically, making more waves.

                              JUMP CUT:

Ben idly goes through Janey's drawers.

INT. WILLIAMS MASTER BATHROOM. CONT'D

He rifles through the bathroom cabinet, checking out the
medicines.

INT. WILLIAMS BEDROOM. CONT'D

He notices a garter belt hanging from the walk-in closet
door. He picks it up and twirls it.

INT. MIKEY'S ROOM. CONT'D

Benjamin walks in, an obvious look of distaste.

He sorts through a few of Mike's things -- monster eyes that
glow in the dark, The Sensuous Woman, etc.

He twirls the garter belt absentmindedly, then tosses it into
the back of Mike's closet.

INT. GUEST ROOM. CONT'D

He finishes putting his clothes back on. As he reaches for
the door, he hears voices and quickly steps back in again.

Teenage voices. Mikey and Wendy.

               MIKEY (O.S.)
     See, no one's here. Maybe you want
     to go to the basement?

               WENDY (O.S.)
     Maybe we can just watch some TV.

               MIKEY (O.S.)
     There's a TV in the basement.

Hood hears their steps down into the basement.

INT. BASEMENT. DAY

Wendy and Mikey stand in the middle of the semi-lit basement.

               MIKEY 
     Maybe we can mess around. You know,
     only if you want to...

               WENDY
     I don't know.

               MIKEY
     Why did you -- with Sandy?

               WENDY
     I don't know.

               MIKEY
     You like him? He worships you.

But Wendy doesn't seem to hear -- she's drawn to an object
lying next to a bean bag chair off to one side.

               WENDY
     Hey, what's this?

With a look of utter fascination, she picks up a Nixon mask,
looking at it as though it were an archeological find.

               WENDY (CONT'D)
     Wow!

               MIKEY
     Wendy!

She puts the mask on.

               WENDY
          (from behind the mask)
     I won't take my pants off. But I'll
     touch it. That's as far as it goes.

Mikey looks totally confused.

Remaining fully clothed, Wendy loosens Mike's belt, showing
no excitement from behind her mask, and lets him climb on top
of her for a dry hump.

Just then, a shaft of light hits them from the top of the
stairs -- Ben towers above them, looking down.

Mikey flips over immediately and pulls his clothes together,
grabbing a TV Guide as Wendy stands up, the mask still on.

As Ben descends Mikey, still stuffing his shirt-tail into his
pants, pretends to flip through the TV Guide.

               MIKEY
          (muttering)
     When worlds collide.

               WENDY 
     Huh?

               MIKEY 
     4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.

Ben arrives, folds his arms.

               BEN 
     What the hell are you kids doing
     down here?

               WENDY 
     What do you think we're doing, dad?

               BEN 
     What do I think? I think you're
     probably touching each other. I
     think you're touching that reckless
     jerk-off, for god's sake, and I
     think he's trying to get into your
     slacks. I think, at fourteen years
     of age, that you're getting ready
     to give up your girlhood --

               MIKEY 
     Hey, hang on there, Mr. Hood --

               BEN 
     Don't you direct a single word at
     me, Mikey. I don't want to hear it.
     I'll be speaking with your parents
     about this situation very soon. Bet
     your ass on that, son. Young lady?

               WENDY 
     Talking to me, dad?

               BEN 
     Who else would I be talking to? And
     take that thing off!

               WENDY
          (pulling off the mask)
     Well, then forget all this stern
     dad stuff.

               BEN 
     I'm not interested in your smart
     ass remarks now, lady. Let's go.
     Right now. You and I can discuss it
     on the walk home.

She stands next to Mikey for a moment, both on the verge of
tears.

EXT. STREET. EVENING

Hood and Wendy walk through a cold drizzling rain.

He looks at her from time to time, then takes her arm.

               BEN 
     Look, kiddo, don't worry about it.
     I really don't care that much. I'm
     just not sure he's good enough,
     that's all.

               WENDY 
     Huh?

               BEN 
     I mean, he's not serious, he'll end
     up living off Janey and Jim, you
     watch.
     It's just that you develop a sense
     when you get older, if things are
     going to work out or if they won't,
     and sometimes it's not worth the
     mess...

She looks at him. They keep walking. She walks through a
puddle.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     Your toes cold?

               WENDY
     Yeah.

He stops and lifts her in his arms.

               BEN
     I'll carry you up the drive.

She puts her arms around his neck and he lifts her up.

On her face, as he carries her -- a look of blank but real
intimacy.

INT. HOOD FRONT HALL. EVENING

Hood and Wendy enter, wet and cold, muttering hellos.

               ELENA (O.S.)
          (from the kitchen)
     Dinner in ten minutes.

               BEN
     You go dry off now.

Wendy heads for the stairs, Hood following.

INT. HOOD BEDROOM. EVENING

Hood finishes taking off his wet clothes as Elena enters and
turns on a light. She stands watching him.

               BEN
     Never guess where I found her.

Not much response From Elena.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     In the basement over at Janey and
     Jim's. With that weirdo Mikey. Not
     even a TV on.
     And they're on the floor and he's
     got his trousers down though thank
     goodness she's still dressed. Well,
     I really let him have it! 
          (a nervous laugh)
     ... and Wendy came home
     peacefully... Hey, should I dress
     for the Halford's now, or - give me
     your -

               ELENA 
     Up to you. I'd like to go early and
     leave pretty soon after that.

               BEN 
     I get you loud and clear... hey,
     you look nice.

               ELENA 
     So what were you doing in the
     Williams' basement anyway?

               BEN 
     Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup.
     Jim left it, last time he was over.
     It was on the dash of the car. You
     were, you know, reading, thought
     I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.

               ELENA 
     Oh right. The mustache coffee cup.
     The one that was sitting on the
     dash.

               BEN 
     Yeah, that one.

               ELENA 
     That one.

She walks down to the kitchen, Benjamin following her.

INT. KITCHEN. EVENING

Wendy is already in the kitchen, fishing through the drawers
for silverware and napkins.

Paul enters.

               PAUL
     See you. 

               BEN
     Stay out of trouble.

               ELENA
     You'll be on the 10:30 train?

               PAUL
     11:30?

               ELENA
     Paul --

               BEN
     Ah let the guy have his fun. What's
     the name of this girl with the Park
     Avenue address?

               PAUL
     Libbets. Libbets Casey.

               BEN
     Libbets? What kind of name is
     Libbets?

INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT

A silent dinner of turkey sandwiches with Elena, Benjamin,
and Wendy. The turkey carcass sits, embarrassed, in the
middle of the table.

Wendy, finished, gets up from the table. Opens the fridge,
but finds nothing. Then goes to the candy shelf and grabs
some Hot Tamales, leaving the room without a word and going
into the den.

INT. DEN. NIGHT

Wendy turns the TV on.

               TV
     ... and that ends today's highlight
     coverage of the Watergate affair.

               WENDY
     Shoot.

INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT

Hood and Elena rise from the table with their dishes.

               BEN
     What's for dessert?

               ELENA
     See for yourself.

               BEN
     No advice from the experts, huh?

His plate slips out of his hands into the trash. He fishes it
out and sets it on the counter.

               ELENA
     Don't start.

               BEN
     You think I --

               ELENA
     I have no idea.

               BEN
     What's on your mind? Don't --

               ELENA
     It wouldn't make a pleasant
     evening, if that's what you're
     after. I don't want to talk about
     it. Stupid mustache cup.

               BEN
     What do you mean?

               ELENA
     Don't be dim.

               BEN
     Elena, what are you're talking
     about?

               ELENA
     I'm not surprised.

               BEN
     Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull
     that passive aggressive stuff on me
     again --

               ELENA
     Your unfaithfulness -- that's what
     I'm trying to talk about. Your
     unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your
     dalliance. And you won't do me the
     dignity of being up front about it.

               BEN
          (quieter)
     Am I unfaithful? Is that what
     you're trying to say?

               ELENA
     It's a starting place.

               BEN
     Well, what kind of faithfulness are
     you after?

               ELENA 
     If you're going to insult me --

               BEN
     What else could I be? What else
     could I be? We're not living in the
     real world here. You're living out
     some fantasy land from the past, or
     some advice or something from those
     psychoanalysts... there are some
     hard facts here.

Silence.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     It's the law of the land... the
     government, the world, those two
     guys on the Yankees... And I'm not
     having any fun at it, I can tell
     you that. I'm not...

INT. DEN. NIGHT

Wendy puts the volume of the TV up, to drown out a
conversation she can almost overhear but doesn't want to.

INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT. CONT'D

               ELENA 
     Oh lord. You think I'm so dense.
     And now you want to be seen with
     your dense wife at the cocktail
     party. You want to wear that
     ridiculous shirt which doesn't go
     with those pants at all. You want
     to wear that, and you want me to
     shake hands with your friends and
     make conversation and dress up in
     an outfit that shows a lot of
     cleavage and you're not going to
     accord me the respect of talking
     honestly about this... You don't
     really know what this feels like.

               BEN
          (whispering)
     Sure I do. Do I know what
     loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I
     know a lot about it, if that's what
     you mean.

               ELENA 
     Benjamin. That's supposed to
     explain it?

Seemingly tired, he stands before her. Silence. Elena sighs,
then walks into the den.

INT. DEN. NIGHT

               ELENA 
     We're going to the Halford's. The
     number's on the calendar in the
     kitchen. We should be home around
     11.

               WENDY
          (eyes still glued to the
           TV)
     Is it a big party? A big
     neighborhood party?

               ELENA 
     I suppose. Why?

               WENDY 
     Just curious. If there's a problem,
     I guess I'll just call you there to
     interrupt.

               ELENA 
     What sort of problems are you
     planning exactly?

Elena kisses the top of her head.

               WENDY
          (still watching the TV)
     Oh I thought I'd steal the station
     wagon, drive up to a commune. Or
     set the house on fire. You know.

               ELENA 
     Just bundle up. It's supposed to
     freeze tonight. We'll see you in
     the morning.

EXT. HOOD HOUSE. NIGHT

Elena and Ben emerge from the house, and look up at a
darkening, foreboding sky. A light rain falls. They jog
toward their car.

INT/EXT. HOOD CAR. NIGHT

The car moves slowly through the rainy suburban streets.

Inside, Elena and Ben don't speak.

EXT. HALFORD HOUSE. NIGHT

Their Firebird pulls up. There are already many other cars
parked on the lawn and driveway.

INT. HALFORD FOYER. NIGHT

Hood and Elena enter. Dot Halford accosts them.

               DOT 
     Ben, Elena. Wonderful! Wonderful!
     So wonderful to see you.

Finishing the last of a celery canoe, she kisses the air next
to Ben's ear and gives Elena a manic hug.

Then, picking up a white salad bowl from the hall table:

               DOT (CONT'D)
     Would you care to play? New this
     year.

Close on: the bowl full of keys.

               DOT (CONT'D)
     Strictly volunteer, of course. You
     can put your coats in the library
     if you like.

               ELENA
     Oh, damn. Uh, I've left the --

               BEN 
     You've...

               ELENA 
     In the car.

               BEN 
     Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right
     back, Dot.

INT./EXT. CAR. CONT'D

Ben and Elena climb back in the car and close the doors,
shivering.

               ELENA 
     This just isn't the best moment for
     this.

               BEN 
     I know, I know. I had no idea --

               ELENA 
     That this was going to be a key
     party?

               BEN 
     Yeah, well, if we'd understood we
     could have invented some kind of
     excuse. A key party -- did you see
     how stuffed that bowl was already?

               ELENA 
     Well?

               BEN 
     I think we're here and we don't
     have to stay -- we ought simply to
     put in an appearance and then we
     can head home.

               ELENA 
     Damn it, Ben --

               BEN 
     I'm not staying at this party so we
     can go home with someone else's
     wife. That's not why we're here,
     right? We're simply being neighbors
     here, and I think we should do just
     that --

               ELENA 
     You're not going to --

               BEN 
     I'm not.

               ELENA 
     You have some marker, that's what I
     think, if you want to know the
     truth.
     You have some marker and you're
     going to put it on the house keys
     so that Janey can find them and
     then when I get back to the house
     I'll find the two of you in there
     and Wendy'll be able to hear you
     and Paul will be back and he'll
     hear you and I'll catch you, that's
     what I think. She'll be swearing
     and banging against the wall and
     I'll catch --

               BEN 
     Elena.

She rubs her eyes.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     Elena, it's not what you think.
     It's not a big plot. Honestly.
     Honestly. I don't know if you want
     to go over this now, but it's just
     something that comes over me. I
     don't feel good about it. I know
     I've done what I didn't want to do.
     I don't know --

               ELENA 
     Well, I'm really pleased to hear a
     confession.

               BEN 
     Elena, you're just getting wound up
     to get wound up.

               ELENA 
     Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben.
     Thank you. So let's just go to this
     fiasco if that's what you want to
     do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather
     talk to anyone else but you.

She pulls the keys out of the ignition, gets out of the car,
and slams the door. He follows her.

INT. HALFORD FOYER. NIGHT

               ELENA 
     Oh, Dot!

Elena, entering the house again, tosses the keys at Dot
Halford, who looks surprised.

Hood slides in behind his wife.

Dot drops the keys into the bowl.

Slow-motion, close up: the keys, on their equine chain, fall
in with a THUNDEROUS CRASH.

INT. HALFORD LIVING ROOM. CONT'D

The room is crowded with nervous, expectant couples and
various groupings.

Elena slips into a side room.

Benjamin heads over immediately to the drink table and pours
a stiff one, turning around to find at his elbow none other
than George Clair.

               GEORGE 
     Benjie!

               BEN 
     Clair, George Clair! What the hell
     brings you to New Canaan?

               GEORGE 
     Well, it's the funniest thing. I've
     been talking to some investors -- a
     little outside venture, you
     understand, between you and me --
     about a scheme to manufacture a new
     Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut
     like pieces that can really keep an
     item free from trauma during
     shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it
     turns out the genius behind the
     whole project is your neighbor, Jim
     Williams. How about that!

               BEN 
     Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a
     million coincidence. A real
     dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?

               GEORGE
     Darned right. Look here, Benj,
     whaddya make of this sequel to The
     Godfather? You think it's gonna
     work?

               BEN
     Don't see how. I think the public's
     had its fill of this gangster
     stuff. No, trust me -- disaster
     pics. And air hockey.

               GEORGE
     Yeah, good.

Benjamin catches a glimpse of Janey, voluptuously attired,
across the room.

               GEORGE (CONT'D)
     Well, gonna make a break for the
     hors d'oeuvres guy.

               BEN
     Yeah, see you bright and early
     Monday am.
          (beat)
     Say, where's the wife?

               GEORGE
          (winking as he goes)
     In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm
     a free agent tonight.

At this, they both notice Elena slowly gliding across the
other side of the room. Clair gives Ben a sideways glance,
then moves on.

Ben makes straight for Janey, who pretends to be preoccupied
with a plant.

               JANEY 
     Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you
     are.

               BEN 
     Damn right, but where the hell were
     you?

               JANEY 
          (looking around)
     What are you talking about?

               BEN
          (whispering, but too
           loudly)
     Don't bullshit me around, Janey.
     Jesus Christ, I waited around for
     more than half an hour, in nothing
     but my boxer shorts, and -- and
     what's all that about? What the
     hell happened?

Janey takes a sip of her drink.

               JANEY 
     A prior engagement overcame me.

               BEN 
     What?

               JANEY 
     Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have
     obligations that precede your...
     from before you showed up. One or
     two, you know, good-natured
     encounters, that doesn't mean
     I'm... I'm not just some toy for
     you. When I remembered some chores
     I wanted to get done before the
     party, I just did them, that's all,
     because I wanted to do them before
     I saw Jimmy.

               BEN 
     Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to
     take this. And what do you mean,
     Jimmy? I thought you said you and
     your husband --

               JANEY 
     How you take it isn't all that
     interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm
     sorry --

               BEN 
     I just can't believe you could be
     so --

Stalling, he watches her take another sip of her drink and
wander off.

The air is filled with talk of Watergate, Billie Jean King,
the Oil Crisis, the Mets.

Benjamin goes over to the couch, where Dave Gorman is
chatting up an attractive younger woman.

               GORMAN
          (lighting up a joint)
     Welcome to the Monkey House has
     been a seminal influence on me --
     hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This
     stuff will make some sense out of
     those larger questions.

               BEN 
          (waving it away)
     Thanks for the advice Dave.

But then, Benjamin changes his mind.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     Uh, well, what the hey...

Taking the joint, he tugs on it, holding the smoke in his
lungs.

               BEN (CONT'D)
          (coughing)
     Good shit.

               GORMAN 
     Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I
     had it in my chamber for a while. I
     was smoking this other --

               BEN 
     It's what?

               GORMAN
     Don't fret, Benjie, it's --

               BEN 
     Darn it, Dave.

He rises unsteadily, weaving through the room's
conversations.

               JACK MOELLERING 
     Take California. They've got their
     own airline in-state that's not
     subject to the fare controls.
     Compare Sacramento to L.A. on the
     controlled airlines and you'll see
     what Friedman is saying -- supply
     and demand, less restriction.

Benjamin walks over to a window. The outdoor lamps illuminate
a new and heavy downpour of frozen sleet.

INT. CONRAIL TRAIN. NIGHT

Paul is seated, reading the latest number of The Fantastic
Four comic book. The cover displays a lurid, atomically
glowing baby.

The conductor walks through the cabin.

               CONDUCTOR 
     Approaching our final stop, Grand
     Central Station.

Paul looks out the window at the tenements of Harlem, barely
visible through the walls of sleet. Soon the train enters the
tunnel toward the station.

EXT. PARK AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDING. NIGHT

Paul gets out of a cab and heads inside. He's met by the
doorman.

               PAUL
     Libbets Casey, please.

               DOORMAN
     Your name?

               PAUL
     Paul Hood.

               DOORMAN
          (a smirk)
     Elevator on the right. Eighth floor
     -- she's waiting for you.

INT. HALL IN FRONT OF LIBBETS' APARTMENT DOOR. NIGHT

Paul rings the bell.

               LIBBETS (O.S.)
          (from the other side of
           the door)
     Open it Paul!

Paul opens the door, and enters the apartment.

INT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT

It's half dark, has an air of old wealth.

Libbets skids across the parquet floor to him.

               LIBBETS 
     Excellent. We were waiting!

She turns and runs into the den.

               PAUL
          (under his breath)
     We?

And there, in the den, cleaning an ounce of dope on an open
copy of Nixon's Six Crises, is -- Francis.

               FRANCIS
          (lifting the book up)
     You oughtta read this Hood, Nixon,
     our leader, all ye need know about
     the travails of life. Check out the
     Checkers speech stuff.

               PAUL
          (all hope drained from
           him) 
     Francis. You gonna leave the seeds
     in there? In the binding like that?

               FRANCIS 
     All will be revealed, baby.

The television is turned on to a weather report about the
coming ice storm.

               FRANCIS (CONT'D)
     Awesome sleet and rain.

               LIBBETS 
     Major.

               FRANCIS 
     Howdy there. You, young knight. Can
     you check on the mead? Can you
     sally forth and secure us some more
     mead?

               PAUL 
     Huh?

               FRANCIS
          (nasal voice,
           impersonating a TV
           character)
     Moisture! Moisture!

               LIBBETS
          (pointing)
     Beer. In the pantry.

Paul trudges disconsolately out of the room.

INT. LIBBETS KITCHEN. NIGHT

Paul, after wandering a maze of halls, enters the kitchen,
where he takes a six-pack out of the fridge and returns to
the living room.

INT. LIBBETS LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

He enters the room with the beer.

               LIBBETS
     Frankie opens them with his teeth.

               PAUL 
          (handing him a beer)
     Hey, it's a sellable skill.

Francis licks closed a second joint, then takes the beer and
opens it with his rear molars.

               FRANCIS
     Hell on the fillings.

Paul opens the other two beers and hands one to Libbets. They
light up a joint.

               FRANCIS 
     Everything's gonna freeze, the big
     freeze.

               LIBBETS 
     Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home
     okay?

Paul and Francis exchange a look.

She puts an Allman Brothers tape on the 8-track and turns the
TV down.

INT. HOOD BATHROOM. DAY

Wendy enters the bathroom.

She fills the sink with water, then turns off the tap. She
takes a razor blade from the counter, and slowly,
determinedly, holds it to her wrist.

She presses it into her skin, drawing a small drop of blood.

               WENDY
     Ouch!

She drops the blade and splashes water on her wrist, grabbing
some toilet paper and holding it against the tiny wound.

               WENDY 
     Stupid.

She hears the phone ring and walks downstairs.

INT. HOOD DEN. NIGHT

Wendy picks up the phone.

               WENDY 
     Hood residence.

INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. NIGHT

Mikey is on the other end of the line.

               MIKEY 
     You're parents at that party?

                              INTERCUT:

               WENDY 
     Yeah. Yours?

               MIKEY 
     You get in trouble?

               WENDY 
     Maybe. Can't really tell yet.

               MIKEY 
     I'm sorry if I got you into
     trouble. Maybe we don't have to,
     you know... unless you really want
     to.

               WENDY 
     Yeah.

               MIKE 
     I'm going to Silver Meadow, check
     out the ice storm... You wanna
     come.

               WENDY 
     Maybe.

               MIKE 
     Yeah. OK.

INT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. NIGHT

Mikey, bundled up in a huge orange ski parka and cap, heads
for the door.

               SANDY 
     Where you going?

               MIKEY 
     Out.

               SANDY 
     It's freezing.

               MIKEY 
          (pausing)
     Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that
     means the molecules are not moving.
     So when you breathe, there's
     nothing in the air, you know, to
     breathe in to your body. The
     molecules have stopped. So it's
     clean.

Sandy just looks at him. He walks out into the night.

INT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT

Elena sits on a couch, talking to no one, barely looking up,
when someone stands in front of her.

               ELENA 
     Reverend Edwards.

               PHILIP 
     Perhaps you might find it in your
     heart to call me Philip?

He sits beside her.

               ELENA 
     You're here... I'm a bit surprised.

               PHILIP 
     Sometimes the shepherd needs the
     company of the sheep.

               ELENA 
     I'm going to try hard not to
     understand the implications of that
     simile.

Philip's about to reply, but thinks better of it.

They sit glumly next to each other for a minute. Then Philip
rises.

               PHILIP
     Forgive me.

He walks swiftly to the hall and hurriedly fishes his keys
out of the bowl, then heads for the door.

               TED FRANKLIN
          (passing by)
     I hope those weren't my keys.

He laughs at his own joke as Philip rushes out the front
door.

Back to Elena, even more forlorn than before.

INT. LIBBETS APARTMENT BATHROOM. NIGHT

Paul enters the bathroom. We hear Francis' and Libbets'
voices from the other room, laughing.

He pees.

At the sink, he pauses in front of the medicine cabinet, then
opens it.

               PAUL 
     Eureka.

He pulls out some bottles.

               PAUL
     Valium. Seconal. Uh,
          (can't quite pronounce
           this one)
     Par-er-goric?
          (a beat, looking into the
           mirror for effect)
     Francis Chamberlain Davenport the
     Fourth -- tonight you sleep the
     sleep of the just.

He pockets the Seconal and turns out the light.

INT. LIBBETS APARTMENT DEN. NIGHT

Paul re-enters the den to find Francis alone.

               PAUL 
     And whence has yon virginal maiden
     absconded?

               FRANCIS 
     Like into one of the other 20 or so
     bathrooms they've got in this
     place.

Paul takes out the bottle and opens it.

               PAUL 
     Check it out. Not for the faint of
     heart.

               FRANCIS 
     Pharmaceutical! You are a god.

               PAUL (CONT'D)
          (picking up beer, trying
           to hurry before Libbets
           returns)
     One for you and one for me.

He hands a pill to Francis, then pretends to pop one into his
mouth and takes a swig of his beer. As Francis downs his own,
Paul pockets his unswallowed pill.

               LIBBETS
          (in the doorway)
     No candy for me?

               FRANCIS 
     Groovy.
          (to Paul)
     Young master of the revels, a treat
     for our hostess?

               PAUL 
     Well, uh, I don't, it's really --

               LIBBETS 
     What is it?

               FRANCIS 
     Come on Paulie, share the wealth.
     You copped 'em from her mom's stash
     anyway.

               LIBBETS 
     Let's see!

               PAUL
          (hand in pocket)
     Libbets, you really shouldn't mix
     and match, you know with the beer.
     I'll put 'em back.

Libbets reaches into his pocket and pulls out the bottle.

               LIBBETS 
     Oh far out, Paulie. Hey look, these
     expired like five months ago. You
     think they're better aged?

She opens up the bottle and takes one out.

               PAUL 
     Maybe you should have just a half.

               LIBBETS 
     Thanks for the advice dad.

She takes the pill.

Paul looks on, thwarted.

INT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT

Ben is back at the bar, pouring another tall one. Mark Boland
sidles up next to him.

               BOLAND 
     Benjie, feeling no pain.

               BEN 
     As the Indian saying goes, pain is
     merely an opinion.

               BOLAND
          (nodding across the room)
     Hey -- check it out. Maria Conrad's
     brought her son.
          (walking off)
     I wish some of the gang had brought
     their daughters!

Ben feels a wave of distaste at the joke.

He looks across the room as Maria and her son Neil (stringy
hair, acne, tie-dyed turtleneck, patched jeans) are engaging
Janey and Philip Edwards in conversation.

INT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT

Paul, Francis, and Libbets sit on the floor, listening to the
music blasting at full strength.

Libbets and Francis are obviously on the verge of
unconsciousness. Paul regards them with a look of
apprehension on his face.

INT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT

Neil has now cornered Janey.

               NEIL 
     As Werner says, there is nothing to
     get. That's It. When you get that
     there's nothing to get. That's the
     training, when you ask yourself,
     the question, "What is is?"

               JANEY 
     Wait, this is the training, where
     they don't let you go to the
     bathroom?

               NEIL 
     That was the hardest part. But I
     did it. And you get into some far
     out shit.

INT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT

Libbets puts a blanket over a sleeping Francis, who's crashed
out on the floor in a corner. Francis alternates between
snores and various mumbled delirious ravings.

               FRANCIS 
     The foot... the foot... toeclipper
     man...

Paul is sitting on the couch, and Libbets comes back and sits
at his feet, facing up to him.

               PAUL 
     I guess he's just real exhausted
     from, you know, tests and stuff.

Libbets is herself somewhat in dreamland.

               LIBBETS 
     Yeah.

               PAUL 
     You know Libbets, I really feel,
     you know, like a real connection to
     you --

               LIBBETS 
     Yeah but you don't even know me
     really.

               PAUL 
     Sure I do, you know, like your
     aura. That you give off.

               LIBBETS 
     My what?

               PAUL 
     It's like very positive, and I feel
     a real special feeling, because you
     really --

               LIBBETS 
     And I have a special feeling too,
     because I do. It's special.

               PAUL 
     You do? I'm glad. Because I feel
     for you --

               LIBBETS 
     And I have a feeling for you too,
     because you're just like -- I feel
     for you like you're -- you're just
     like --

               PAUL AND LIBBETS
          (simultaneously)
     -- like a brother.

               PAUL 
     Yeah, you're not alone with that
     line.

               LIBBETS 
     I do.

               PAUL 
     Right. Cool. So, how about we take
     a bath together?

               LIBBETS
          (consciousness fading
           fast)
     Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like
     a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm
     so wasted.

Her head bobs and weaves, her eyes close, and suddenly her
head falls forward with a whoosh toward the couch -- smack
dab between Paul's legs.

She begins to snore instantly, her open mouth nuzzling into
his crotch.

Paul doesn't move, doesn't even breathe. Then, slowly, he
leans his back into the couch, without shifting the rest of
his body.

He looks as though he has simultaneously won the lottery and
received a lobotomy.

INT. HALFORD'S. NIGHT

The crowd's a bit thinner than before.

As Dot Halford begins calling out for everyone's attention, a
few couples make their last-minute way to the door.

               DOT 
     OK everyone. We have a little
     business to attend to now. So
     everyone who'd like to stay, please
     gather in the living room.

She scoops up the bowl and places it on a high end table
which has been put in the middle of the room.

               BEN
          (walking up to Elena)
     Ready to go?

               ELENA
     We're not going anywhere.

Elena waves at Janey Williams, who is standing across the
living room.

Janey looks back without expression.

INT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT

Libbets and Paul in the same position whence last we saw
them.

Paul delicately leans to one side of the couch and picks up a
phone. He dials a number.

                              INTERCUT:

INT. HOOD LIVING ROOM. NIGHT

The phone rings. Wendy picks it up.

               WENDY 
     Hood residence.

               PAUL
          (whispering)
     Charles, what time is it?

               WENDY 
     Is this Charles?

               PAUL 
     What time is it?

               WENDY 
     Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?

               PAUL 
     I'm, uh, in the midst of a moral
     dilemma. And I was wondering,
     because I know you're a very moral
     person, and --

               WENDY 
     And?

               PAUL 
     Shit. I can't really talk about it.
     I guess I better get to the train.

               WENDY 
     Right.

               PAUL 
     What are you doing at home on a
     Friday night?

               WENDY 
     I have plans.

Paul hangs up the phone and looks down at Libbets.

Libbets' Allman Brothers tape has run out. The machine makes
a repeated clicking sound as the take up real continues to
circle. The only other sound is the noise of the wind and
rain lashing against the apartment's windows.

EXT. HOOD HOUSE. NIGHT

Wendy emerges from the house and gets on her bike, but the
ice makes it too slippery. The storm is now in full swing.
She gets off and walks.

EXT. STREET. NIGHT

Wendy walks, barely keeping her balance in the wind.

INT. HALFORD'S NIGHT

All the couples are now gathered for the key selection
process, men on one side of the room, women on the other. The
storm can be heard outside.

               DOT 
     Well, what shall the order be,
     alphabetical? In order of
     appearance?

               PIERCE SAWYER 
     Golf handicap! Lowest handicap does
     the honors.

Nervous laughter.

               DOT 
     Golf handicap? Ladies, isn't it up
     to you?

               MARIA CONRAD 
     Oh I'll go first, damn it. Let's
     just line up and get it over with.

Maria chooses Stephen Earle. Hands the keys to him. A
smattering of applause as she takes his arm and they leave.

               MARIE EARLE 
     Good luck!

Neil watches his mother's exit.

                              JUMP CUT TO:

A few more couplings.

                              JUMP CUT TO:

Helen Worthington approaches the bowl. Helen Worthington has
the size and shape of a sumo wrestler.

There is a nervous shifting of weight on the male side of the
room.

Helen delicately reaches into the bowl. Her hands emerge with
a key chain.

George Clair steps forward, obviously depressed, as a
collective sigh of relief goes up from behind him. Ben looks
on, momentarily triumphant.

Elena smiles to herself.

                              JUMP CUT TO:

The Gadds choose each other.

               MRS. GADD 
     Oh, my own husband. Isn't that
     against the rules?

               DOT 
     Try again?

               MRS. GADD 
          (relieved)
     Oh, I think not.

Mr. Gadd smiles as they leave, obviously happy to go.

Finally, only Mark Boland, Neil Conrad, Janey and Jim
Williams, Rob and Dot Halford, Sari Steele, Benjamin and
Elena.

               DOT 
     Getting down to the wire!

Elena steps forward. Benjamin is obviously agitated.

Close on Janey's hands selecting -- away from Ben's equine
key ring.

She lifts up another key ring -- Neil Conrad, the teenager.

She hands the self-important-looking Neil his keys and they
turn to go.

Jim Williams smiles mysteriously to himself.

Ben suddenly lurches forward, semi-drunkenly, trying to
separate Neil from Janey.

               THE GROUP
          (ad lib)
     Hey hey Ben, hang on there a sec.

He backs off, ashamed, and, taking a step backwards, trips
over the coffee table.

Mark Boland helps lift him up.

               BEN 
     Sorry... maybe I should... the
     bathroom?

               DOT
     Right down the hall, Ben.

               BEN
          (muttering)
     Sorry, I'm sorry. Uh, I'll be back.

Dot follows Mark Boland down the hall behind Ben.

Suddenly, it's just Elena and Jim Williams, and Sari Steele
and Rob Halford.

               ROB HALFORD
          (taking Sari's arm)
     Actually, we didn't put our keys in
     at all. But you won't spread it
     around? It's my party, and Dot
     isn't... hey, we're just going to
     slip upstairs for a while. You
     folks like a cup of coffee or
     something before we go?

Elena and Jim look at each other.

               ELENA 
     Rob, we'll fix it for ourselves.
     You two go and get acquainted.
     We'll let ourselves out the front
     door.

Jim and Elena stand there alone.

               JIM 
     Well, I have to say I don't have
     much faith that my car keys are
     still in that bowl. Doesn't seem
     entirely safe, leaving your car
     keys around?

               ELENA 
     Let me.

She takes the bowl and dips her hand in. Two sets are left.
One, her own, she avoids. She takes out Jim's keys and walks
across the room, handing them to him.

               JIM 
     Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think
     so. It's been kind of a
     discouraging evening.

               ELENA 
     You couldn't have hoped for much
     better when you came up the walk.

               JIM 
     Somehow it was different in my
     imagination when I thought about
     it. Actually, I didn't think about
     it at all, really.

They sit down on the sofa.

               JIM 
     You want coffee or something?

               ELENA 
     Well, maybe they have one of those
     filter jobs in the kitchen --

               JIM 
     Look, Elena, the fact that we're
     neighbors... you know, close
     friends, well it sort of makes this
     a little strange, don't you think?

               ELENA 
     My husband is probably passed out
     in the bathroom, or at least he
     wishes he were. I've been married
     to him for 17 years and I don't
     have any intention of going in
     there to get him... so what I'm
     proposing is that since your wife
     has gone off with a boy, and since
     you are standing here alone, I'm
     proposing that you and I do what
     makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some
     time. That's all.

They both look at their hands.

               ELENA 
     Now don't make me feel as if I'm
     being too forward, OK? If you don't
     --

               JIM 
     What the hey. Let's go for a drive.

               ELENA 
     Okay. Shall we clean up around here
     first? Do you think it's all right--

               JIM 
     Nah, that wasn't in the contract.

But they still walk around turning off lights.

In the hallway, Elena looks a bit mournfully at the light
seeping from underneath the bathroom door. She hears the
sound of running water from inside.

Then she goes into a sideroom and joins Jim. They pick up
their coats.

EXT. HALFORD HOUSE. NIGHT

Elena and Jim walk outside into the freezing, pelting rain.

Covering their faces, they jog to his car, an oversized
Cadillac. A thick glaze of ice forms on his windshield.

INT. JIM'S CADILLAC. NIGHT

They climb in.

               JIM 
     We're going to have to defrost this
     thing for a while.

He turns on the ignition, and the vents start to blow cold
air at them.

He leans over and kisses her.

               ELENA 
     Do these seats go back?

That starts it. He jumps at her, unbuckling her and unzipping
himself.

They tangle uncomfortably for a few seconds. And then,
comically, he's in her.

With a groan, it's over in a flash.

Jim pulls himself off, readjusting his pants.

               JIM 
     That was awful, really awful. I'm
     so sorry, Elena.

Elena has somehow worked herself into the cavity of the glove
compartment, and is trying to figure out how to extricate
herself.

               JIM 
     Things are really rotten at home.
     You wouldn't believe how rotten.
     Janey's sick. She's unstable, I
     guess... it's not the right time to
     tell you... but that's it -- it's
     like I can't make her happy, the
     boys can't make her happy, she just
     doesn't --

               ELENA 
     Jim, maybe we should just go. I've
     got to look in on the kids. Paul is
     supposed to be coming back in from
     the city.

               JIM 
     Jesus, let me make it up to you --
     I can do better than that, honestly
     --

               ELENA 
     Well, we can talk about it.

               JIM 
     That's fine. I wouldn't expect you
     to see it any other way.

               ELENA 
     Maybe you just need -- look, can
     you wait here a sec, I need to tidy
     up -- just a minute, I'll be right
     back. You'll wait?

               JIM 
     Of course.

She opens the door and walks back to the house.

INT. HALFORD'S. CONT'D

Elena hesitantly walks to the bathroom.

She opens the door. Ben's sitting on the floor, next to the
toilet, woozily flipping through the pages of a magazine.

               BEN 
     Elena.

               ELENA 
     Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe
     you should sleep this one off on
     the couch here?

               BEN 
     I'll drive you --

               ELENA 
     Ben.

She sits on the toilet next to him, stroking his hair.

               ELENA (CONT'D)
     You're in no condition to drive.
     We'll talk in the morning, OK?

He sits, accepting and quiet.

               ELENA (CONT'D)
     You'll get some sleep on the couch
     out there?

               BEN 
          (looking up at her, with
           gratitude)
     Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in
     the morning?

               ELENA 
     We'll talk in the morning.

EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. NIGHT

Wendy walks up the drive in the rain, pauses, then goes to
the front door and knocks lightly. The door swings ajar. She
pushes on it, and lets herself in.

INT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. NIGHT

               WENDY 
     Anyone home? Hello.

Wendy wanders into the living room, then climbs the steps.
The sound of the wind and the darkness begin to scare her.

She goes into Mikey's room -- it's even more of a disaster
zone than usual.

She sees on the wall his dark-light poster of the 12 (sexual)
positions of the zodiac.

She notices the black garter belt on the floor, and picks it
up, absentmindedly swinging it in her hand as she walks out
of the room.

She walks back down the stairs and into the kitchen, leaving
the garter belt on the counter.

She opens the refrigerator, grabs a jar of peanut butter, and
scoops some up in her finger. As she puts her finger in her
mouth --

               SANDY 
     Wendy.

She gives out a little yelp.

               WENDY 
     Sandy, you scared the shit out of
     me.

               SANDY 
     What are you doing?

               WENDY 
     Just thought I'd stop by.

               SANDY 
     Mike's out -- I think he went to
     Silver Meadow to see if you were
     hanging around there.

               WENDY 
     Yeah.

               SANDY 
          (pause)
     Are you his girlfriend?

               WENDY 
     No.

INT. JIM'S CADILLAC. NIGHT

Elena gets in. They drive off silently.

EXT. STREETS. NIGHT

The car moves haltingly through the sleet and ice, inches up
a hill, then falters and slides back silently, circling a
couple of times before crashing into an embankment.

INT. CAR. NIGHT

As the car slides and crashes amid Jim's and Elena's screams.

Silence.

               JIM 
     You okay?

               ELENA
     Yeah. You?

               JIM 
     Yes. Well, I guess we can walk from
     here.

EXT. CAR. NIGHT

Jim and Elena get out, shaky, from the car.

They pause for a moment.

The street lamp above them sizzles, but stays on.

They start to walk.

INT. LIBBETS' APARTMENT. NIGHT

Paul and Libbets, still frozen in the same position. Finally,
Paul gently pushes Libbets' head back.

It slides off his leg and, as Paul lurches forward in a
failed attempt to grab it, Libbets flops backwards, her head
hitting the carpet with a dull but decidedly loud thump.

               PAUL
     Oh shit!

Paul gets up, looks down at her.

She snores.

He runs over to a side table and sees the clock: 11:10.

               PAUL (CONT'D)
     Oh shit oh shit.

He grabs his comic books and runs for the door.

INT. TAXI. NIGHT

The driver impassively inches down Park Avenue.

               PAUL 
     Oh shit oh shit. C'mon!

INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM. NIGHT

Paul sprints down the platform just as the doors are closing.
He barely makes it into the train.

INT. TRAIN. NIGHT

Paul walks through the nearly empty train car and finds a
seat. He pulls his Fantastic Four comic book out of his coat
pocket.

INT. HALFORD KITCHEN. NIGHT

Ben makes his way to the kitchen, pours himself a cup of
coffee.

He sees himself reflected in the black glass of the cabinets.

INT. SANDY'S ROOM. NIGHT

Sandy and Wendy are sitting on the floor. He grabs his G.I.
Joe.

               SANDY 
     Check this out. He's supposed to
     talk all kinds of stuff, but he's
     like malfunctioned.

He pulls the dog tag on the doll, and G.I. Joe emits a
plastic macho voice.

               G.I. JOE 
     Mayday! Mayday! Get this message
     back to base!

               SANDY 
     Same thing. Again and again.

Wendy takes the doll and yanks the cord.

               G.I. JOE 
     Mayday! Mayday! Get this message
     back to base!

               SANDY 
     It's gonna get a lot colder
     tonight, I predict. Probably a
     blackout. Do you have candles in
     your house?
     I know where the candles are, and I
     have my own flashlight. Over there.
     Also, I know where every emergency
     exit is on this floor.

During the course of his monologue, as Wendy looks on, Sandy
calmly ties a noose for his doll.

               SANDY 
     This knot's called a bowline.

He puts the noose over the doll's head, as Wendy holds him.

               G.I. JOE 
     Mayday! Mayday!

               SANDY 
     Let's hang him.

Sandy drapes the noose over the edge of a dresser drawer.
G.I. Joe dangles. They both look at him in silence.

The silence continues.

               WENDY 
     He's dead.

               SANDY 
     If it wasn't raining we could take
     him outside and blow him up.

               WENDY 
     He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get
     all mangled or twisted.

She takes him down and lays him flat on the bed. And then
begins to remove his clothes.

Sandy looks on, desirous.

               WENDY 
     Well.
          (noticing his lack of
           anatomy) 
     It looks like someone got to his
     private parts before us.

               SANDY 
     Communist Viet Cong.

               WENDY 
     They left it in the jungle.

They speak with high seriousness.

Wendy slides up on the bed where Sandy sits, a pillow on his
lap, and one by one, with exaggerated slowness, she removes
her snowboots, as if they were stiletto heels.

               WENDY 
     Can I get into your bed? 
          (pause)
     With you?

Sandy begins to shake.

               SANDY 
     We -- we have to go to the guest
     room. We can't stay in here. What
     if Mikey? My parents?

               WENDY 
     Don't worry about them. They're at
     that party, getting drunk and
     falling all over each other and
     making jokes about McGovern and
     stuff.

Sandy begins to cry.

               SANDY 
     It's just -- it's just --

She takes his hand, and they walk out of the room and down
the hall, into the guest room.

INT. GUEST ROOM. NIGHT

Wendy and Sandy enter. She sees the vodka bottle on the
dresser.

               WENDY 
     Want a drink?

               SANDY 
     Vodka?

               WENDY 
     You never tasted the stuff?

She fills the glass to the brim and hands the bottle to
Sandy.

They clink and each toss back a sip -- Wendy almost the
entire glass.

Sandy coughs and gags, but swallows.

               WENDY 
     Try again.

He does.

               SANDY 
     It feels warm.

               WENDY 
     One more shot?

               SANDY 
     Okay.

They drink.

               WENDY 
     Under the covers.

Under they go, and soon every layer of clothing emerges.

               WENDY
          (feeling her way)
     Get 'em off.

Sandy begins to laugh, and soon Wendy joins him.

They roll around on top of each other for a while.

               WENDY 
     Have you ever had a nocturnal
     emission?

               SANDY 
     Huh?

               WENDY 
     That's the name for when you wake
     up and find this little pool of
     sticky stuff, like after a sexy
     dream.

Sandy shakes his head.

               WENDY 
     They didn't tell you this stuff
     yet? What planet do you live on?

Sandy doesn't answer, but climbs back on top of her and
kisses her neck.

               SANDY
     I love you.

               WENDY 
     That's nice. Are you drunk?

               SANDY 
     I don't know. How do I know?

               WENDY 
     I don't know either. You spin
     around, when you lie down.

Sandy rolls off her and lies on his back.

               SANDY (CONT'D)
     I don't think I'm spinning.

They cuddle up together.

He yawns. She yawns.

EXT. SILVER MEADOW. NIGHT

Mikey walks along the edge of the empty pool in the rain. He
climbs up on the diving board and bounces lightly on it, but
then gets off and stands, looking down at the pool again.

EXT. SILVER MEADOW. NIGHT

Mikey walks across the field.

EXT. STREET. NIGHT

The storm has let up. Mikey walks along. With a running
start, he slides on the ice down a hill.

He walks back up and slides again, hollering with joy. He is
an image of a tiny yet absolute and positive freedom.

The streetlights sputter on, then off.

INT. WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM. NIGHT

Sandy and Wendy lie asleep.

EXT. STREET. NIGHT

A power line is down. It hisses and HUMS -- a humming very
much like the humming Mikey has been hearing earlier.

The humming takes on the same transcendent tonality to which
Mikey has become so accustomed at such moments.

Mikey sits down on a metal street guardrail, to ponder the
sound and the snaking coil of electricity.

A strange look of almost religious wonder overcomes his face,
as the power line connects to the guardrail.

               MIKEY 
     Oh shit.

Glued by an electrical pulse to the rail, he shakes as the
current flows through him.

After a minute, his body slumps and slides down the road.

INT. TRAIN. NIGHT

As Paul sits reading on he moving train, the lights inside
begin to sputter, and the train begins to slow. After a few
moments, the train grinds to a halt, and Paul and his few
fellow late night passengers are left in near total dark,
with only the light of an emergency exit sign above Paul's
head to light the scene.

The train is eerily silent.

EXT. HOOD CAR. NIGHT

Ben drives home.

EXT. STREET. NIGHT

An emergency vehicle, lights flashing, crawls by Ben's car.
He drives on slowly.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF WILLIAMS HOUSE. PRE-DAWN

Jim and Elena arrive on foot.

               JIM 
     You want to come in, get a cup of
     coffee -- warm up? I can either
     walk you home, or you could crash
     in the guest room.

               ELENA 
     Sure. Maybe coffee.

INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. PRE-DAWN

               JIM 
     Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --

He walks into the kitchen. The pipes have begun to burst.
There's a water leak running down the walls, forming a puddle
on the floor.

Elena has walked into the kitchen behind him. She leans
against the counter, picking up the garter belt without
thinking for a second, then putting it back down.

               JIM 
     Oh well. Why don't you put on some
     dry socks -- and we've got some
     rain boots in the guest closet back
     there. Last room upstairs -- back
     of the hall.

Elena climbs the stairs in her bare feet.

INT. WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM. CONT'D

Elena opens the door, and discovers Wendy and Sandy asleep.
She stands before the bed, and gazes down on them.

They look almost angelic.

Wendy, sensing her presence in the room, opens her eyes,
slowly coming out of sleep.

               ELENA
          (heartbroken, softly)
     Get dressed.

Elena walks out of the room, back to the kitchen.

Wendy gets out of bed quietly, leaving Sandy sleeping
peacefully.

She looks at him lovingly, and tucks the blanket back up
around him.

INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. DAWN

Elena and Jim are drinking coffee.

               ELENA 
     You should let him sleep.

Wendy enters. She looks inquisitively at the two adults.

               WENDY 
     Where's dad?

INT. HOOD CAR. DAWN

Ben continues to drive slowly. He looks out his side window,
and sees something. He puts on his brakes.

EXT. STREET. DAWN

Ben gets out of the car, and stands on the top of an icy
embankment. In a clump of bushes is the orange glow of a
parka.

He walks hesitantly toward it. Mike's body lies face down in
the wet ice.

Ben leans down and turns the body over, then stands back in
amazement and saddened shock.

He stands there for a moment, then picks Mike's body up,
carrying him over the hill and onto the street. We see now
that he is parked just a short block from the Williams's
house.

He bypasses his car and walks directly down the street toward
the house. The effort is obviously enormous. He falls from
time to time, then gets back up.

INT. TRAIN. PRE-DAWN

Various passengers asleep.

Paul, hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit
light, cold. He reads his comic book by the light of the
emergency exit.
     "DON'T YOU SEE, SUE? HE WAS TOO
     POWERFUL... IF HIS ENERGY HAD
     CONTINUED TO BUILD, HE WOULD HAVE
     DESTROYED THE WORLD!"

Suddenly, the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the
train's engines returns.

The conductor enters the car, blasting forth in his classic
nasal train conductor voice.

               CONDUCTOR
     Good morning ladies and gentlemen --

On Paul, squinting in the harsh light.

EXT. TRAIN BRIDGE. PRE-DAWN

The train moves slowly through a suburban, semi-forested
landscape. On the street below the bridge, an emergency
highway crew is removing a fallen tree, their trucks aglow in
flashing yellow lights.

INT. WILLIAMS KITCHEN. DAWN

Elena pours Wendy a cup of coffee. They're both in their
coats.

               WENDY
     I don't like coffee.

               ELENA
     It'll warm you up.

Elena sits next to her. They both raise their cups and sip
the coffee, not noticing the simultaneity of their movements.

INT. GUEST ROOM. DAWN

Jim watches the sleeping Sandy, picks up the half-empty
bottle of vodka, pours himself a drink. The noise wakes Sandy
up. Jim sits down on the bed at his feet and takes a sip.

               SANDY
     Dad?

Jim looks at him.

INT. KITCHEN. DAWN

Elena and Wendy hear a hollering from outside, get up to see
what it is.

EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. DAWN

Elena and Wendy come out the front door, as Ben lays Mikey's
body onto the ground before the front steps.

               ELENA 
     Ben?

He's too breathless to speak.

They stand there, looking down at Mikey.

Behind Elena and Wendy, Jim appears.

He pushes softly by them toward the body of his son.

               BEN
     Jim -- he was just up --  in Silver
     Lane -- I think maybe -- a power
     line --

Jim picks up his son.

He carries him silently into the house.

Sandy, now standing inside the foyer, pushes himself back
against the wall as they pass, without expression.

After a moment, from outside, the Hoods can hear Jim's
wailing.

               BEN 
     Do you think? Maybe we should call
     someone --

               ELENA 
     The phone's out.

               BEN (CONT'D)
     Yeah. Well, we can just --

               ELENA 
     Ben, I don't think he wants us
     here.

Wendy has been watching Sandy through the screen door.

               WENDY 
     Wait, I --

She turns back up the front steps and gently goes in --

INT. WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM. CONT'D

on the living room floor, Jim is hugging Mike's body, his
shoulders shaking uncontrollably, sobbing.

Wendy walks and stands next to Sandy, who is filled
momentarily with a brief inexplicable rush of anger toward
her -- but she takes him and gives him an awkward, childlike
hug, then turns and runs out the door, joining Ben and Elena
on the driveway. Sandy watches her go, his face wet with
tears.

EXT. WILLIAMS HOUSE. CONT'D

               ELENA 
     Oh you know, for a minute I thought
     it was --

               BEN
     Paul? Yeah. You think --

               WENDY 
     He's probably been waiting all
     night at the station.

               BEN 
     C'mon.

EXT. STREET. DAWN

Elena, Wendy, and Ben reach the car and get in. The car
starts and drives off.

There are more crews out cleaning up the storm's debris and
fixing the power lines as they drive.

EXT. CONRAIL STATION. EARLY MORNING

The train slowly pulls in. The Hood family walks down to the
end of the platform.

The train doors open, and Paul, tired and a bit cramped,
emerges. He sees his family gathered at the other end of the
platform, and walks to them.

They stand, silent, even dignified, awaiting him.

When he joins them they all walk silently to the car and get
in.

INT. HOOD CAR. EARLY MORNING

Sunlight floods in and temporarily blinds Ben as he starts
the engine.

He squints, his eyes tearing a bit from the light.

He looks around, first at his wife, then at his two children
sitting in the back seat.

He turns off the engine. Quietly, he begins to cry.

He turns to the back seat.

               BEN 
     There's something -- your mother
     and I -- have to tell you two --

Elena puts her hand out, almost touching him.

               ELENA
          (softly)
     Ben.

Paul looks at Wendy, silently asking her what's happening.

She casts her eyes downward, as does he.

               ELENA (CONT'D)
          (her hand still not yet
           touching him)
     Ben.

EXT. STATION PARKING LOT. MORNING

From above:

The car, the first morning light shining upon it.

                      THE END
