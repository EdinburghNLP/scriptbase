In the weekend after thanksgiving 1973 the Hoods are skidding out of control.
Benjamin Hood reels from drink to drink, trying not to think about his trouble at the office.
His wife, Elena, is reading self help books and losing patience with her husband's lies.
Their son, Paul, home for the holidays, escapes to the city to pursue an alluring rich girl from his prep school.
And young, budding nymphomaniac, Wendy Hood roams the neighborhood, innocently exploring liquor cabinets and lingerie drawers of her friends' parents, looking for something new.
Then an ice storm hits, the worst in a century.
Things get bad...
