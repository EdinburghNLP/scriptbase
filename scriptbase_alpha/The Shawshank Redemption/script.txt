                THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION

                                 by

                           Frank Darabont


                        Based upon the story 
                Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption
                        by Stephen King



1     INT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 

     A dark, empty room. 

     The door bursts open. A MAN and WOMAN enter, drunk and 
     giggling, horny as hell. No sooner is the door shut than 
     they're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at 
     flesh, mouths locked together. 

     He gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over 
     instead. Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like 
     getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She 
     arches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. He slams her against 
     the wall, ripping her skirt. We hear fabric tear. 

     He enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the 
     wall. She cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not 
     caring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with 
     the sensations running through her. He carries her across the 
     room with her legs wrapped around him. They fall onto the bed. 

     CAMERA PULLS BACK, exiting through the window, traveling 
     smoothly outside... 

2     EXT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 2

     ...to reveal the bungalow, remote in a wooded area, the 
     lovers' cries spilling into the night... 

     ...and we drift down a wooded path, the sounds of rutting 
     passion growing fainter, mingling now with the night sounds of 
     crickets and hoot owls... 

     ...and we begin to hear FAINT MUSIC in the woods, tinny and
     incongruous, and still we keep PULLING BACK until... 

     ...a car is revealed. A 1946 Plymouth. Parked in a clearing. 

3     INT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 3

     ANDY DUFRESNE, mid-20's, wire rim glasses, three-piece suit. 
     Under normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly
     dangerous, perhaps even meek. But these circumstances are far 
     from normal. He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. A 
     cigarette smolders in his mouth. His eyes, flinty and hard, are 
     riveted to the bungalow up the path. 

     He can hear them fucking from here. 

     He raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. The radio 
     plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him: 

          You stepped out of a dream... 
          You are too wonderful... 
          To be what you seem... 

     He opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped
     in a rag. He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully --

     -- revealing a .38 revolver. Oily, black, evil. 

     He grabs a box of bullets. Spills them everywhere, all over 
     the seats and floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets off his lap, 
     loading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim. 
     Six in the chamber. His gaze goes back to the bungalow. 

     He shuts off the radio. Abrupt silence, except for the distant 
     lovers' moans. He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then 
     opens the door and steps from the car. 

4     EXT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 4

     His wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. Loose bullets scatter to 
     the ground. The bourbon bottle drops and shatters. 

     He starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. The closer he 
     gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. Louder and more 
     frenzied. The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of 
     passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts. 

                    WOMAN (O.S.) 
          Oh god...oh god...oh god... 

     Andy lurches to a stop, listening. The woman cries out in 
     orgasm. The sound slams into Andy's brain like an icepick. He 
     shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop. 

     It finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left 
     is the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus. We hear 
     languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction. 

                    WOMAN (O.S.) 
          Oh god...that's sooo good...you're 
          the best...the best I ever had... 

     Andy just stands and listens, devastated. He doesn't look like 
     much of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt 
     path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun 
     held loosely at his side. A pathetic figure, really.

5     INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 5

     THE JURY listens like a gallery of mannequins on display, 
     pale-faced and stupefied. 

                    D.A. (O.S.) 
          Mr. Dufresne, describe the 
          confrontation you had with your 
          wife the night she was murdered. 

     ANDY DUFRESNE 

     is on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed, 
     hair meticulously combed. He speaks in soft, measured tones: 

                    ANDY 
          It was very bitter. She said she 
          was glad I knew, that she hated all 
          the sneaking around. She said she 
          wanted a divorce in Reno. 

                    D.A. 
          What was your response? 

                    ANDY 
          I told her I would not grant one. 

                    D.A. 
               (refers to his notes) 
          I'll see you in Hell before I see
          you in Reno. Those were the words 
          you used, Mr. Dufresne, according 
          to the testimony of your neighbors. 

                    ANDY 
          If they say so. I really don't 
          remember. I was upset. 

     FADE TO BLACK: 2ND TITLE UP 

                    D.A. 
          What happened after you and your 
          wife argued? 

                    ANDY 
          She packed a bag and went to stay 
          with Mr. Quentin. 

                    D.A. 
          Glenn Quentin. The golf pro at the 
          Falmouth Hills Country Club. The 
          man you had recently discovered was 
          her lover. 
               (Andy nods) 
          Did you follow her? 

                    ANDY 
          I went to a few bars first. Later, 
          I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's 
          home and confront them. They 
          weren't there...so I parked my car 
          in the turnout...and waited. 

                    D.A. 
          With what intention? 

                    ANDY 
          I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. 
          I think mostly I wanted to scare them. 

                    D.A. 
          You had a gun with you? 

                    ANDY 
          Yes. I did. 

     FADE TO BLACK: 3RD TITLE UP 

                    D.A. 
          When they arrived, you went up 
          to the house and murdered them? 

                    ANDY 
          No. I was sobering up. I realized 
          she wasn't worth it. I decided to 
          let her have her quickie divorce. 

                    D.A. 
          Quickie divorce indeed. A .38 
          caliber divorce, wrapped in a 
          handtowel to muffle the shots, 
          isn't that what you mean? And then 
          you shot her lover! 

                    ANDY 
          I did not. I got back in the car 
          and drove home to sleep it off. 
          Along the way, I stopped and threw 
          my gun into the Royal River. I feel 
          I've been very clear on this point. 

                    D.A. 
          Yes, you have. Where I get hazy, 
          though, is the part where the 
          cleaning woman shows up the next 
          morning and finds your wife and her 
          lover in bed, riddled with .38 
          caliber bullets. Does that strike 
          you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. 
          Dufresne, or is it just me? 

                    ANDY 
               (softly) 
          Yes. It does. 

                    D.A. 
          I'm sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don't 
          think the jury heard that. 

                    ANDY 
          Yes. It does. 

                    D.A. 
          Does what? 

                    ANDY 
          Strike me as a fantastic coincidence. 

                    D.A. 
          On that, sir, we are in accord... 

     FADE TO BLACK! 4TH TITLE UP 

                    D.A. 
          You claim you threw your gun into 
          the Royal River before the murders 
          took place. That's rather convenient. 

                    ANDY 
          It's the truth. 

                    D.A. 
          You recall Lt. Mincher's testimony? 
          He and his men dragged that river 
          for three days and nary a gun was 
          found. So no comparison can be made 
          between your gun and the bullets 
          taken from the bloodstained corpses 
          of the victims. That's also rather 
          convenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne? 

                    ANDY 
               (faint, bitter smile) 
          Since I am innocent of this crime, 
          sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient 
          the gun was never found. 

     FADE TO BLACK: STH TITLE UP 

6     INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 6

     The D.A. holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation:

                    D.A. 
          Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard 
          all the evidence, you know all the 
          facts. We have the accused at the 
          scene of the crime. We have foot 
          prints. Tire tracks. Bullets 
          scattered on the ground which bear 
          his fingerprints. A broken bourbon 
          bottle, likewise with fingerprints. 
          Most of all, we have a beautiful 
          young woman and her lover lying 
          dead in each other's arms. They had 
          sinned. But was their crime so 
          great as to merit a death sentence? 

     He gestures to Andy sitting quietly with his ATTORNEY. 

                    D.A. 
          I suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to 
          that would be yes. I further 
          suspect he carried out that 
          sentence on the night of September 
          21st, this year of our Lord, 1946, 
          by pumping four bullets into his 
          wife and another four into Glenn 
          Quentin. And while you think about 
          that, think about this... 

     He picks up a revolver, spins the cylinder before their eyes 
     like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune. 

                    D.A. 
          A revolver holds six bullets, not 
          eight. I submit to you this was not 
          a hot-blooded crime of passion! 
          That could at least be understood, 
          if not condoned. No, this was 
          revenge of a much more brutal and 
          cold-blooded nature. Consider! Four 
          bullets per victim! Not six shots 
          fired, but eight! That means he 
          fired the gun empty...and then 
          stopped to reload so he could shoot 
          each of them again! An extra bullet 
          per lover...right in the head. 
               (a few JURORS shiver) 
          I'm done talking. You people are 
          all decent, God-fearing Christian 
          folk. You know what to do.

7     INT -- JURY ROOM -- DAY (1946) 7

     CAMERA TRACKS down a long table, moving from one JUROR to the 
     next. These decent, God-fearing Christians are chowing down on 
     a nice fried chicken dinner provided them by the county, 
     smacking greasy lips and gnawing cobbettes of corn. 

                    VOICE (O.S.) 
          Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty... 

     We find the FOREMAN at the head of the table, sorting votes.

     Andy stands before the dias. THE JUDGE peers down, framed by a 
     carved frieze of blind Lady Justice on the wall. 

                    JUDGE 
          You strike me as a particularly icy 
          and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. 
          It chills my blood just to look at 
          you. By the power vested in me by 
          the State of Maine, I hereby order 
          you to serve two life sentences, 
          back to back, one for each of your 
          victims. So be it. 

     He raps his gavel as we 

     CRASH TO BLACK: LAST TITLE UP. 

9      AN IRON-BARRED DOOR 9

     slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room waits beyond.
     CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit side by side at
     a long table. An empty chair faces them. We are now in: 

     INT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1947) 

     RED enters, removes his cap and waits by the chair. 

                    MAN #1 
          Sit. 

     Red sits, tries not to slouch. The chair is uncomfortable. 

                    MAN #2 
          We see by your file you've served 
          twenty years of a life sentence. 

                    MAN #3 
          You feel you've been rehabilitated? 

                    RED 
          Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned 
          my lesson. I can honestly say I'm a 
          changed man. I'm no longer a danger 
          to society. That's the God's honest 
          truth. No doubt about it. 

     The men just stare at him. One stifles a yawn. 

     CLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM 

     A big rubber stamp slams down: "REJECTED" in red ink. 

10     EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DUSK (1947) 10

     High stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire, set off at
     intervals by looming guard towers. Over a hundred CONS are 
     in the yard. Playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each 
     other, making deals. Exercise period. 



     RED emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the 
     activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing 
     minor business. He's an important man here. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          There's a con like me in every prison 
          in America, I guess. I'm the guy who 
          can get it for you. Cigarettes, a 
          bag of reefer if you're partial, a 
          bottle of brandy to celebrate your 
          kid's high school graduation. Damn 
          near anything, within reason. 

     He slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleight-of-hand.

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Yes sir, I'm a regular Sears & 
          Roebuck. 

     TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS issue from the main tower, drawing 
     everybody's attention to the loading dock. The outer gate 
     swings open...revealing a gray prison bus outside. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 
          1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita 
          Hayworth into the prison for him, I 
          told him no problem. And it wasn't. 

                    CON 
          Fresh fish! Fresh fish today! 

     Red is joined by HEYWOOD, SKEET, FLOYD, JIGGER, ERNIE, SNOOZE. 
     Most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but Red and his 
     group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably. 

11     INT -- PRISON BUS -- DUSK (1947) 11

     Andy sits in back, wearing steel collar and chains. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Andy came to Shawshank Prison in 
          early 1947 for murdering his wife 
          and the fella she was bangin'. 

     The bus lurches forward, RUMBLES through the gates. Andy gazes 
     around, swallowed by prison walls. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          On the outside, he'd been vice- 
          president of a large Portland bank. 
          Good work for a man as young as he 
          was, when you consider how 
          conservative banks were back then. 

                    TOWER GUARD 
          All clear! 

     GUARDS approach the bus with carbines. The door jerks open. 
     The new fish disembark, chained together single-file, blinking 
     sourly at their surroundings. Andy stumbles against the MAN in 
     front of him, almost drags him down. 

     BYRON HADLEY, captain of the guard, slams his baton into 
     Andy's back. Andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. JEERS 
     and SHOUTS from the spectators. 

                    HADLEY 
          On your feet before I fuck you up 
          so bad you never walk again.

          from the front. He'll be the first.

          Bullshit. I'll take that action. 

                    ERNIE 
          Me too. 

     Other hands go up. Red jots the names.

          see...fifth from the front. Put me

                    RED 
          That's five cigarettes on Fat-Ass. 
          Any takers? 

     More hands go up. Andy and the others are paraded along, 
     forced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching 
     under the barrage of jeers and shouts. The old-timers are 
     shaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their 
     pants. Some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look 
     terrified. Especially Andy. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I must admit I didn't think much of 
          Andy first time I laid eyes on him. 
          He might'a been important on the 
          outside, but in here he was just a 
          little turd in prison grays. Looked 
          like a stiff breeze could blow him 
          over. That was my first impression 
          of the man. 

                    SKEET 
          What say, Red? 

                    RED 
          Little fella on the end. Definitely. 
          I stake half a pack. Any takers? 

                    SNOOZE 
          Rich bet. 

                    RED 
          C'mon, boys, who's gonna prove me 
          wrong? 
               (hands go up) 
          Floyd, Skeet, Joe, Heywood. Four brave 
          souls, ten smokes apiece. That's it, 
          gentlemen, this window's closed. 

     Red pockets his notepad. A VOICE comes over the P.A. speakers:

                    VOICE (amplified) 
          Return to your cellblocks for 
          evening count. 

14     INT -- ADMITTING AREA -- DUSK (1947) 14

     The new fish are marched in. Guards unlock the shackles. The
     chains drop away, rattling to the stone floor. 

                    HADLEY 
          Eyes front. 

     WARDEN SAMUEL NORTON strolls forth, a colorless man in a gray
     suit and a church pin in his lapel. He looks like he could 
     piss ice water. He appraises the newcomers with flinty eyes.

                    NORTON 
          This is Mr. Hadley, captain of the 
          guard. I am Mr. Norton, the warden. 
          You are sinners and scum, that's 
          why they sent you to me. Rule 
          number one: no blaspheming. I'll 
          not have the Lord's name taken in 
          vain in my prison. The other rules 
          you'll figure out as you go along. 
          Any questions? 

                    CON 
          When do we eat? 

     Cued by Norton's glance, Hadley steps up to the con and screams
     right in his face: 

                    HADLEY 
          YOU EAT WHEN WE SAY YOU EAT! YOU 
          PISS WHEN WE SAY YOU PISS! YOU SHIT 
          WHEN WE SAY YOU SHIT! YOU SLEEP 
          WHEN WE SAY YOU SLEEP! YOU MAGGOT- 
          DICK MOTHERFUCKER! 

     Hadley rams the tip of his club into the con's belly. The 
     man falls to his knees, gasping and clutching himself. 
     Hadley takes his place at Norton's side again. Softly: 

                    NORTON 
          Any other questions? 
               (there are none) 
          I believe in two things. Discipline 
          and the Bible. Here, you'll receive 
          both. 
               (holds up a Bible) 
          Put your faith in the Lord. Your 
          ass belongs to me. Welcome to 
          Shawshank. 

                    HADLEY 
          Off with them clothes! And I didn't 
          say take all day doing it, did I? 

     The men shed their clothes. Within seconds, all stand naked. 

                    HADLEY 
          First man into the shower! 

     Hadley shoves the FIRST CON into a steel cage open at the 
     front. TWO GUARDS open up with a fire hose. The con is slammed 
     against the back of the cage, sputtering and hollering. 
     Seconds later, the water is cut and the con yanked out. 

                    HADLEY 
          Delouse that piece of shit! Next 
          man in! 

     The con gets a huge scoop of white delousing powder thrown all
     over him. Gasping and coughing, blinking powder from his eyes,
     he gets shoved to a trustee's cage. The TRUSTEE slides a short
     stack of items through the slot -- prison clothes and a Bible.
     All the men are processed quickly -- a blast of water, powder,
     clothes and a Bible... 

15     INT -- INFIRMARY -- NIGHT (1947) 15

     A naked CON steps before a DOCTOR and gets a cursory exam. 
     A penlight is shined in his eyes, ears, nose, and throat. 

                    DOCTOR 
          Bend over. 

     The con does. A GUARD with a penlight in his teeth spreads his 
     cheeks, peers up his ass, and nods. Andy is next up. He gets 
     the same treatment. 


16     INT -- PRISON CHAPEL -- NIGHT (1947) 16

     CAMERA TRACKS the naked newcomers shivering on hard wooden 
     chairs, clothes on their laps, Bibles open. 

                    CHAPLAIN (O.S.) 
          ...maketh me to lie down in green 
          pastures. He leadeth me beside the 
          still waters. He restoreth my soul... 

17     INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1947) 17

     Three tiers to a side, concrete and steel, gray and imposing. 
     Andy and the others are marched in, still naked, carrying 
     their clothes and Bibles. The CONS in their cells greet them 
     with TAUNTS, JEERS, and LAUGHTER. One by one, the new men are 
     shown to their cells and locked in with a CLANG OF STEEL. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          The first night's the toughest, no 
          doubt about it. They march you in 
          naked as the day you're born, fresh 
          from a Bible reading, skin burning 
          and half-blind from that delousing 
          shit they throw on you... 

     Red watches from his cell, arms slung over the crossbars, 
     cigarette dangling from his fingers. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          ...and when they put you in that 
          cell, when those bars slam home, 
          that's when you know it's for real. 
          Old life blown away in the blink of 
          an eye...a long cold season in hell 
          stretching out ahead...nothing 
          left but all the time in the world 
          to think about it. 

     Red listens to the CLANGING below. He watches Andy and a few 
     others being brought up to the 2nd tier. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Most new fish come close to madness 
          the first night. Somebody always 
          breaks down crying. Happens every 
          time. The only question is, who's 
          it gonna be? 

     Andy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          It's as good a thing to bet on as 
          any, I guess. I had my money on 
          Andy Dufresne... 

18     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 18

     The bars slam home. Andy is alone in his cell, clutching his 
     clothes. He gazes around at his new surroundings, taking it 
     in. He slowly begins to dress himself... 

19     EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- NIGHT (1947) 19

     A malignant stone growth on the Maine landscape. The moon 
     hangs low and baleful in a dead sky. The headlight of a 
     PASSING TRAIN cuts through the night. 

20     INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 20

     Red lies on his bunk below us, tossing his baseball toward the 
     ceiling and catching it again. He pauses, listening. FOOTSTEPS 
     approach below, unhurried, echoing hollowly on stone. 

21     INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1947) 21

     LOW ANGLE. A CELLBLOCK GUARD strolls into frame. 

                    GUARD 
          That's lights out! Good night, ladies. 

     The lights bump off in sequence. The guard exits, footsteps
     echoing away. Darkness now. Silence. CAMERA CRANES UP the 
     tiers toward Red's cell. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I remember my first night. Seems a 
          long time ago now. 

     Red looms from the darkness, leans on the bars. Listens. 
     Waits. From somewhere below comes faint, ghastly tittering.
     VOICES drift through the cellblock, taunting: 

                    VARIOUS VOICES (O.S.) 
          Fishee fishee fisheeee...You're 
          gonna like it here, new fish. A 
          whooole lot...Make you wish your 
          daddies never dicked your 
          mommies...You takin' this down, new 
          fish? Gonna be a quiz later. 
               (somebody LAUGHS) 
          Sshhh. Keep it down. The screws'll 
          hear...Fishee fishee fisheeee... 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          The boys always go fishin' with 
          first-timers...and they don't quit 
          till they reel someone in. 

     The VOICES keep on, sly and creepy in the dark... 

22     INT -- VARIOUS CELLS -- NIGHT (1947) 22
     thru thru 25
     2g ...while the new cons go quietly crazy in their cells. One man
     paces like a caged animal...another sits gnawing his cuticles
     bloody...a third is weeping silently...a fourth is dry-heaving
     into the toilet... 

26     INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 26

     Red waits at the bars. Smoking. Listening. He cranes his head,
     peers down toward Andy's cell. Nothing. Not a peep. 

                    HEYWOOD (O.S.) 
          Fat-Ass...oh, Faaaat-Ass. Talk to 
          me, boy. I know you're in there. I 
          can hear you breathin'. Now don't 
          you listen to these nitwits, hear? 

27     INT -- FAT-ASS' CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 27

     Fat-Ass is crying, trying not to hyperventilate. 

                    HEYWOOD (O.S.) 
          This ain't such a bad place. I'll 
          introduce you around, make you feel 
          right at home. I know some big ol' 
          bull queers who'd love to make your 
          acquaintance...especially that big 
          white mushy butt of yours... 

     And that's it. Fat-Ass lets out a LOUD WAIL of despair: 

                    FAT-ASS 
          OH GOD! I DON'T BELONG HERE! I 
          WANNA GO HOME! 

28     INT -- HEYWOOD'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 28

                    HEYWOOD 
          AND IT'S FAT-ASS BY A NOSE.' 

29     INT -- CELLBLOCK -- NIGHT (1947) 29

     The place goes nuts. Fat-Ass throws himself screaming against
     the bars. The entire block starts CHANTING: 

                    VOICES 
          Fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh 
          fish...fresh fish... 

                    FAT-ASS 
          I WANNA GO HOME! I WANT MY MOTHER.' 

                    VOICE (O.S.) 
          I had your mother! She wasn't that 
          great! 

     The lights bump on. GUARDS pour in, led by Hadley himself.

                    HADLEY 
          What the Christ is this happy shit? 

                    VOICE (O.S.) 
          He took the Lord's name in vain! 
          I'm tellin' the warden! 

                    HADLEY 
               (to the unseen wit) 
          You'll be tellin' him with my baton 
          up your ass! 

     Hadley arrives at Fat-Ass' cell, bellowing through the bars:

                    HADLEY 
          What's your malfunction you fat 
          fuckin' barrel of monkey-spunk? 

                    FAT-ASS 
          PLEASE! THIS AIN'T RIGHT! I AIN'T 
          SUPPOSED TO BE HERE! NOT ME! 

                    HADLEY 
          I ain't gonna count to three! Not 
          even to one! Now shut the fuck up 
          'fore I sing you a lullabye! 

     Fat-Ass keeps blubbering and wailing. Total freak-out. Hadley 
     draws his baton, gestures to his men. Open it. 

     A GUARD unlocks the cell. Hadley pulls Fat-Ass out and starts 
     beating him with the baton, brutally raining blows. Fat-Ass 
     falls, tries to crawl. 

     The place goes dead silent. All we hear now is the dull
     THWACK-THWACK-THWACK of the baton. Fat-ass passes out. Hadley
     gets in a few more licks and finally stops. 

                    HADLEY 
          Get this tub of shit down to the 
          infirmary. 
               (peers around) 
          If I hear so much as a mouse fart 
          in here the rest of the night, by 
          God and Sonny Jesus, you'll all 
          visit the infirmary. Every last 
          motherfucker here. 

     The guards wrestle Fat-Ass onto a stretcher and carry him off. 
     FOOTSTEPS echo away. Lights off. Darkness again. Silence. 

30     INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 30

     Red stares through the bars at the main floor below, eyes 
     riveted to the small puddle of blood where Fat-Ass went down. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          His first night in the joint, Andy 
          Dufresne cost me two packs of 
          cigarettes. He never made a sound... 

31     INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- MORNING (1947) 31

     LOUD BUZZER. The master locks are thrown -- KA-THUMP! The cons 
     step from their cells, lining the tiers. The GUARDS holler 
     their head-counts to the HEAD BULL, who jots on a clipboard. 
     Red peers at Andy, checking him out. Andy stands in line, 
     collar buttoned, hair combed. 

32     INT -- MESS HALL -- MORNING (1947) 32

     Andy goes through the breakfast line, gets a scoop of glop on
     his tray. WE PAN ANDY through the noise and confusion...and 
     discover BOGS DIAMOND and ROOSTER MacBRIDE watching Andy go 
     by. Bogs sizes Andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye, 
     mutters something to Rooster. Rooster laughs. 

     Andy finds a table occupied by Red and his regulars, chooses
     a spot at the end where nobody is sitting. Ignoring their 
     stares, he picks up his spoon -- and pauses, seeing something
     in his food. He carefully fishes it out with his fingers. 

     It's a squirming maggot. Andy grimaces, unsure what to do with
     it. BROOKS HATLEN is sitting closest to Andy. At age 65, he's
     a senior citizen, a long-standing resident. 

                    BROOKS 
          You gonna eat that? 

                    ANDY 
          Hadn't planned on it. 

                    BROOKS 
          You mind? 

     Andy passes the maggot to Brooks. Brooks examines it, rolling
     it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine 
     cigar. Andy is riveted with apprehension. 

                    BROOKS 
          Mmm. Nice and ripe. 

     Andy can't bear to watch. Brooks opens up his sweater and 
     feeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket.
     Andy breathes a sigh of relief. 

                    BROOKS 
          Jake says thanks. Fell out of his 
          nest over by the plate shop. I'm 
          lookin' after him till he's old 
          enough to fly. 

     Andy nods, proceeds to eat. Carefully. Heywood approaches.

                    JIGGER 
          Oh, Christ, here he comes. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Mornin', boys. It's a fine mornin'. 
          You know why it's fine? 

     Heywood plops his tray down, sits. The men start pulling out
     cigarettes and handing them down. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          That's right, send 'em all down. I 
          wanna see 'em lined up in a row, 
          pretty as a chorus line. 

     An impressive pile forms. Heywood bends down and inhales
     deeply, smelling the aroma. Rapture. 

                    FLOYD 
          Smell my ass... 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Gee, Red. Terrible shame, your 
          horse comin' in last and all. 
          Hell, I sure do love that horse of 
          mine. I believe I owe that boy a 
          big sloppy kiss when I see him. 

                    RED 
          Give him some'a your cigarettes 
          instead, cheap bastard. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Say Tyrell, you pull infirmary duty 
          this week? How's that winnin' horse 
          of mine, anyway? 

                    TYRELL 
          Dead. 
               (the men fall silent) 
          Hadley busted his head pretty good. 
          Doc already went home for the 
          night. Poor bastard lay there till 
          this morning. By then... 

     He shakes his head, turns back to his food. The silence
     mounts. Heywood glances around. Men resume eating. Softly:

                    ANDY 
          What was his name? 

                    HEYWOOD 
          What? What'd you say? 

                    ANDY 
          I was wondering if anyone knew his 
          name. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          What the fuck you care, new fish? 
               (resumes eating) 
          Doesn't matter what his fuckin' 
          name was. He's dead. 

33     INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 33

     A DEAFENING NOISE of industrial washers and presses. Andy works
     the laundry line. A nightmarish job. He's new at it. BOB, the
     con foreman, elbows him aside and shows him how it's done. 

34     INT -- SHOWERS -- DAY (1947) 34

     Shower heads mounted in bare concrete. Andy showers with a
     dozen or more men. No modesty here. At least the water is good
     and hot, soothing his tortured muscles. 

     Bogs looms from the billowing steam, smiling, checking Andy up
     and down. Rooster and PETE appear from the sides. The Sisters.

                    BOGS 

     You're some sweet punk. You been 
     broke in yet? 

     Andy tries to step past them. He gets shoved around, nothing
     serious, just some slap and tickle. Jackals sizing up prey.

                    BOGS 
          Hard to get. I like that. 

     Andy breaks free, flushed and shaking. He hurries off, leaving
     the three Sisters laughing. 

35     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 35

     Andy lies staring at the darkness, unable to sleep. 

36     EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1947) 36

     Exercise period. Red plays catch with Heywood and Jigger, 
     lazily tossing a baseball around. Red notices Andy off to the
     side. Nods hello. Andy takes this as a cue to amble over. 
     Heywood and Jigger pause, watching. 

                    ANDY 
               (offers his hand) 
          Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne. 

     Red glances at the hand, ignores it. The game continues.

                    RED 
          The wife-killin' banker. 

                    ANDY 
          How do you know that? 

                    RED 
          I keep my ear to the ground. Why'd 
          you do it? 

                    ANDY 
          I didn't, since you ask. 

                    RED 
          Hell, you'll fit right in, then. 
               (off Andy's look) 
          Everyone's innocent in here, don't 
          you know that? Heywood! What are 
          you in for, boy? 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me! 

     Red gives Andy a look. See? 

                    ANDY 
          What else have you heard? 

                    RED 
          People say you're a cold fish. They 
          say you think your shit smells 
          sweeter than ordinary. That true? 


                    ANDY 
          What do you think? 

                    RED 
          Ain't made up my mind yet. 

     Heywood nudges Jigger. Watch this. He winds up and throws the
     ball hard -- right at Andy's head. Andy sees it coming out of
     the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. Beat. He sends
     the ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands. Heywood
     drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands. 

                    ANDY 
          I understand you're a man who knows 
          how to get things. 

                    RED 
          I'm known to locate certain things 
          from time to time. They seem to 
          fall into my hands. Maybe it's 
          'cause I'm Irish. 

                    ANDY 
          I wonder if you could get me a 
          rock-hammer? 

                    RED 
          What is it and why? 

                    ANDY 
          You make your customers' motives a 
          part of your business? 


                    RED 
          If you wanted a toothbrush, I 
          wouldn't ask questions. I'd just 
          quote a price. A toothbrush, see, 
          is a non-lethal sort of object. 

                    ANDY 
          Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about 
          eight or nine inches long. Looks 
          like a miniature pickaxe, with a 
          small sharp pick on one end, and a 
          blunt hammerhead on the other. It's 
          for rocks. 

                    RED 
          Rocks. 

     Andy squats, motions Red to join him. Andy grabs a handful of
     dirt and sifts it through his hands. He finds a pebble and
     rubs it clean. It has a nice milky glow. He tosses it to Red.

                    RED 
          Quartz? 

                    ANDY 
          Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. 
          Silted granite. There's some graded 
          limestone, from when they cut this 
          place out of the hill. 

                    RED 
          So? 

                    ANDY 
          I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in 
          my old life. I'd like to be again, 
          on a limited scale. 

                    RED 
          Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy 
          in somebody's skull? 

                    ANDY 
          I have no enemies here. 

                    RED 
          No? Just wait. 

     Red flicks his gaze past Andy. Bogs is watching them. 

                    RED 
          Word gets around. The Sisters have 
          taken a real shine to you, yes they 
          have. Especially Bogs. 

                    ANDY 
          Tell me something. Would it help if 
          I explained to them I'm not 
          homosexual? 

                    RED 
          Neither are they. You have to be 
          human first. They don't qualify. 
               (off Andy's look) 
          Bull queers take by force, that's 
          all they want or understand. I'd 
          grow eyes in the back of my head if 
          I were you. 

                    ANDY 
          Thanks for the advice. 

                    RED 
          That comes free. But you understand 
          my concern. 

                    ANDY 
          If there's trouble, I doubt a rock- 
          hammer will do me any good. 

                    RED 
          Then I guess you wanna escape. 
          Tunnel under the wall maybe? 
               (Andy laughs politely) 
          I miss the joke. What's so funny? 

                    ANDY 

     You'll know when you see the rock- 
     hammer. 

                    RED 
          What's this item usually go for? 

                    ANDY 
          Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

                    RED 
          My standard mark-up's twenty 
          percent, but we're talkin' about a 
          special object. Risk goes up, price 
          goes up. Call it ten bucks even. 

                    ANDY 
          Ten it is. 

                    RED 
          I'll see what I can do. 
               (rises, slapping dust) 
          But it's a waste of money. 

                    ANDY 
          Oh? 

                    RED 
          Folks who run this place love 
          surprise inspections. They turn a 
          blind eye to some things, but not 
          a gadget like that. They'll find 
          it, and you'll lose it. Mention my 
          name, we'll never do business 
          again. Not for a pair of shoelaces 
          or a stick of gum. 

                    ANDY 
          I understand. Thank you, Mr...? 

                    RED 
          Red. The name's Red. 

                    ANDY 
          Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing 
          business with you. 

     They shake. Andy strolls off. Red watches him go. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I could see why some of the boys 
          took him for snobby. He had a quiet 
          way about him, a walk and a talk 
          that just wasn't normal around 
          here. He strolled. like a man in a 
          park without a care or worry. Like 
          he had on an invisible coat that 
          would shield him from this place. 
               (resumes playing catch) 
          Yes, I think it would be fair to 
          say I liked Andy from the start. 

37     INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1947) 37

     Red gets his breakfast and heads for a table. Andy falls in
     step, slips him a tightly-folded square of paper. 

38     INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 38

     Lying on his bunk, Red unfolds the square. A ten dollar bill.

                    RED (V.O.) 
          He was a man who adapted fast. 

39     EXT -- LOADING DOCK -- DAY (1947) 39

     Under watchful supervision, CONS are off-loading bags of dirty
     laundry from an "Eliot Nursing Home" truck. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Years later, I found out he'd 
          brought in quite a bit more than 
          just ten dollars... 

     A certain bag hits the ground. The TRUCK DRIVER shoots a look 
     at a black con, LEONARD, then ambles over to a GUARD to shoot 
     the shit. Leonard loads the bag onto a cart... 

40     INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 40

     Bags are being unloaded. We find Leonard working the line. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          When they check you into this 
          hotel, one of the bellhops bends 
          you over and looks up your works, 
          just to make sure you're not 
          carrying anything. But a truly 
          determined man can get an object 
          quite a ways up there. 

     Leonard slips a small paper-wrapped package out of the laundry 
     bag, hides it under his apron, and keeps sorting... 

4l     INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY EXCHANGE -- DAY (1947) 41

     Red deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where 
     the clean sheets are being handed out. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          That's how Andy joined our happy 
          little Shawshank family with more 
          than five hundred dollars on his 
          person. Determination. 

     Leonard catches Red's eye, turns and grabs a specific stack of 
     clean sheets. He hands it across to Red -- 

     TIGHT ANGLE 

     -- and more than clean laundry changes hands. Two packs of
     cigarettes slide out of Red's hand into Leonard's. 

42     INT -- RED'S CELL -- DAY (1947) 42

     Red slips the package out of his sheets, carefully checks to 
     make sure nobody's coming, then rips it open. He pulls out the 
     rock-hammer. It's just as Andy described. Red laughs softly. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Andy was right. I finally got the 
          joke. It would take a man about six 
          hundred years to tunnel under the 
          wall with one of these. 

43     INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT (1947) 43

     Brooks Hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell. The 
     rolling library. He finds Red waiting for him. Red slips the 
     rock-hammer, wrapped in a towel, through the bars and onto the
     cart. Next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage. 

                    RED 

     Dufresne. 

     Brooks nods, never missing a beat. He rolls his cart to 
     Andy's cell, mutters through the bars: 

                    BROOKS 
          Middle shelf, wrapped in a towel. 

     Andy's hand snakes through the bars and makes the object 
     disappear. The hand comes back and deposits a small slip of 
     folded paper along with more cigarettes. Brooks turns his cart
     around and goes back. He pauses, sorting his books long enough
     for Red to snag the slip of paper. Brooks continues on, 
     scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket. 

44     INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 44

     Red unfolds the slip of paper. Penciled neatly on it is a 
     single word: "Thanks." 

45     INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 45

     We are assaulted by the deafening noise of the laundry line. 
     Andy is doing his job, getting good at it. 

                    BOB 
          DUFRESNE! WE'RE LOW ON HEXLITE! 
          HEAD ON BACK AND FETCH US UP SOME! 

     Andy nods. He leaves the line, weaving his way through the 
     laundry room and into -- 

46     INT -- BACK ROOMS/STOCK AREA -- DAY (1947) 46

     -- a dark, tangled maze of rooms and corridors, boilers and
     furnaces, sump pumps, old washing machines, pallets of 
     cleaning supplies and detergents, you name it. Andy hefts a 
     cardboard drum of Hexlite off the stack, turns around -- 

     -- and finds Bogs Diamond in the aisle. blocking his way.
     Rooster looms from the shadows to his right, Pete Verness
     on the left. A frozen beat. Andy slams the Hexlite to the
     floor, rips off the top, and scoops out a double handful.

                    ANDY 
          You get this in your eyes, it 
          blinds you. 

                    BOGS 
          Honey, hush. 

     Andy backs up, holding them at bay, trying to maneuver through 
     the maze. The Sisters keep coming, tense and guarded, eyes 
     riveted and gauging his every move, trying to outflank him. 
     Andy trips on some old gaint sugglies. That's all it takes. 
     They're on him in an instant, kicking and stomping. 

     Andy gets yanked to his feet. Bogs applies a chokehold from 
     behind. They propel him across the room and slam him against 
     an old four-pocket machine, bending him over it. Rooster jams 
     a rag into Andy's mouth and secures it with a steel pipe, like 
     a horse bit. Andy kicks and struggles, but Rooster and Pete 
     have his arms firmly pinned. Bogs whispers in Andy's ear: 

                    BOGS 
          That's it, fight. Better that way. 

     Andy starts screaming, muffled by the rag. CAMERA PULLS BACK, 
     SLOWLY WIDENING. The big Washex blocks our view. All we see 
     is Andy's screaming face and the men holding him down... 

     ...and CAMERA DRIFTS FROM THE ROOM, leaving the dark place 
     and the dingy act behind...MOVING up empty corridors, past 
     concrete walls and steel pipes... 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I wish I could tell you that Andy 
          fought the good fight, and the 
          Sisters let him be. I wish I could 
          tell you that, but prison is no 
          fairy-tale world. 

     WE EMERGE into the prison laundry past a guard, WIDENING for 
     a final view of the line. The giant steel "mangler" is 
     slapping down in brutal rhythm. The sound is deafening. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          He never said who did it...but we 
          all knew. 

     PRISON MONTAGE: (1947 through 1949) 

47      ANDY PLODS THROUGH HIS DAYS. WORKING. EATING. CHIPPING AND 47
     shaping his rocks after lights-out... 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Things went on like that for a 
          while. Prison life consists of 
          routine, and then more routine. 

48      ANDY WALKS THE YARD, FACE SWOLLEN AND BRUISED. 48 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Every so often, Andy would show up 
          with fresh bruises. 

49      ANDY EATS BREAKFAST. A FEW TABLES OVER, BOGS BLOWS HIM A KISS. 49

                    RED (V.O.) 
          The Sisters kept at him. Sometimes 
          he was able to fight them off... 
          sometimes not. 

50      ANDY BACKS INTO A CORNER IN SOME DINGY PART OF THE PRISON, 
     wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          He always fought, that's what I 
          remember. He fought because he knew 
          if he didn't fight, it would make 
          it that much easier not to fight 
          the next time. 

     The rake connects, snapping off over somebody's skull. They 
     beat the hell out of him. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Half the time it landed him in the 
          infirmary... 


51     INT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT ("THE HOLE") -- NIGHT (1949) 51 

     A stone closet. No bed, sink, or lights. Just a toilet with no 
     seat. Andy sits on bare concrete, bruised face lit by a faint 
     ray of light falling through the tiny slit in the steel door. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          ...the other half, it landed him in 
          solitary. Warden Norton's "grain & 
          drain" vacation. Bread, water, and 
          all the privacy you could want. 

52     INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1949) 52

     Andy is working the line. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          And that's how it went for Andy. That 
          was his routine. I do believe those 
          first two years were the worst for 
          him. And I also believe if things 
          had gone on that way, this place 
          would have got the best of him. 
          But then, in the spring of 1949, 
          the powers-that-be decided that... 

53     EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 53

     Warden Norton addresses the assembled cons via bullhorn: 

                    NORTON 
          ...the roof of the license-plate 
          factory needs resurfacing. I need a 
          dozen volunteers for a week's work. 
          We're gonna be taking names in this 
          steel bucket here... 

     Red glances around at his friends. Andy also catches his eye.

                    RED (V.O.) 
          It was outdoor detail, and May is 
          one damn fine month to be workin' 
          outdoors. 

54     EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 54

     Cons shuffle past, dropping slips of paper into a bucket. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          More than a hundred men volunteered 
          for the job. 

     Red saunters to a guard named TIM YOUNGBLOOD, mutters 
     discreetly in his ear. 

55     EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 55

     Youngblood is pulling names and reading them off. Red 
     exchanges grins with Andy and the others. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Wouldn't you know it? Me and some 
          fellas I know were among the names 
          called. 

56     INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 56

     Red slips Youngblood six packs of cigarettes. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Only cost us a pack of smokes per 
          man. I made my usual twenty 
          percent, of course. 

57     EXT -- LICENSE PLATE FACTORY -- DAY (1949) 57

     A tar-cooker bubbles and smokes. TWO CONS dip up a bucket of
     tar and tie a rope to the handle. The rope goes taught. CAMERA
     FOLLOWS the bucket of tar up the side of the building to -- 

58      THE ROOF 58

     -- where it is relayed to the work detail. the men are dipping
     big Padd brushes and spreading the tar. ANGLZ OVER to Byron 
     Hadley bitching sourly to his fellow guards: 

                    HADLEY 
          ...so this shithead lawyer calls 
          long distance from Texas, and he 
          says, Byron Hadley? I say, yeah. He 
          says, sorry to inform you, but your 
          brother just died. 

                    YOUNGBLOOD 
          Damn, Byron. Sorry to hear that. 

                    HADLEY 
          I ain't. He was an asshole. Run off 
          years ago, family ain't heard of him 
          since. Figured him for dead anyway. 
          So this lawyer prick says, your 
          brother died a rich man. Oil wells 
          and shit, close to a million bucks. 
          Jesus, it's frigging incredible how 
          lucky some assholes can get. 

                    TROUT 
          A million bucks? Jeez-Louise! You 
          get any of that? 

                    HADLEY 
          Thirty five thousand. That's what 
          he left me. 

                    TROUT 
          Dollars? Holy shit, that's great! 
          Like winnin' a lottery... 
               (off Hadley's shitty look) 
          ...ain't it? 

                    HADLEY 
          Dumbshit. What do you figger the 
          government's gonna do to me? Take a 
          big wet bite out of my ass, is what. 

                    TROUT 
          Oh. Hadn't thought of that. 

                    HADLEY 
          Maybe leave me enough to buy a new 
          car with. Then what happens? You 
          pay tax on the car. Repairs and 
          maintenance. Goddamn kids pesterin' 
          you to take 'em for a ride... 

                    MERT 
          And drive it, if they're old enough. 

                    HADLEY 
          That's right, wanting to drive it, 
          wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake! 
          Then at the end of the year, if you 
          figured the tax wrong, they make 
          you pay out of your own pocket. 
          Uncle Sam puts his hand in your 
          shirt and squeezes your tit till 
          it's purple. Always get the short 
          end. That's a fact. 
               (spits over the side) 
          Some brother. Shit. 

     The prisoners keep spreading tar, eyes on their work. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Poor Byron. What terrible fuckin' 
          luck. Imagine inheriting thirty 
          five thousand dollars. 

                    RED 
          Crying shame. Some folks got it 
          awful bad. 

     Red glances over -- and is shocked to see Andy standing up,
     listening to the guards talk. 

                    RED 
          Hey, you nuts? Keep your eyes on 
          your pail! 

     Andy tosses his Padd in the bucket and strolls toward Hadley.

                    RED 
          Andy! Come back! Shit! 

                    SNOOZE 
          What's he doing? 

                    FLOYD 
          Gettin' himself killed. 

                    RED 
          God damn it... 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Just keep spreadin' tar... 

     The guards stiffen at Andy's approach. Youngblood's hand goes
     to his holster. The tower guards CLICK-CLACK their rifle 
     bolts. Hadley turns, stupefied to find Andy there. 

                    ANDY 
          Mr. Hadley. Do you trust your wife? 

                    HADLEY 
          That's funny. You're gonna look 
          funnier suckin' my dick with no 
          fuckin' teeth. 

                    ANDY 
          What I mean is, do you think she'd 
          go behind your back? Try to 
          hamstring you? 

                    HADLEY 
          That's it! Step aside, Mert. This 
          fucker's havin' hisself an accident. 

     Hadley grabs Andy's collar and propels him violently toward
     the edge of the roof. The cons furiously keep spreading tar.

                    HEYWOOD 
          Oh God, he's gonna do it, he's 
          gonna throw him off the roof... 

                    SNOOZE 
          Oh shit, oh fuck, oh Jesus... 

                    ANDY 
          Because if you do trust her, there's 
          no reason in the world you can't 
          keep every cent of that money. 

     Hadley abruptly jerks Andy to a stop right at the edge. In 
     fact, Andy's past the edge, beyond his balance, shoetips 
     scraping the roof. The only thing between him and an ugly drop
     to the concrete is Hadley's grip on the front of his shirt.

                    HADLEY 
          You better start making sense. 

                    ANDY 
          If you want to keep that money, all 
          of it, just give it to your wife. 
          See, the IRS allows you a one-time- 
          only gift to your spouse. It's good 
          up to sixty thousand dollars. 

                    HADLEY 
          Naw, that ain't right! Tax free? 

                    ANDY 
          Tax free. IRS can't touch one cent. 

     The cons are pausing work, stunned by this business discussion.

                    HADLEY 
          You're the smart banker what shot 
          his wife. Why should I believe a 
          smart banker like you? So's I can 
          wind up in here with you? 

                    ANDY 
          It's perfectly legal. Go ask the 
          IRS, they'll say the same thing. 
          Actually, I feel silly telling you 
          all this. I'm sure you would have 
          investigated the matter yourself. 

                    HADLEY 
          Fuckin'-A. I don't need no smart 
          wife-killin' banker to show me where 
          the bear shit in the buckwheat. 

                    ANDY 
          Of course not. But you will need 
          somebody to set up the tax-free 
          gift, and that'll cost you. A 
          lawyer, for example... 

                    HADLEY 
          Ambulance-chaaing, highway-robbing 
          cocksuckers! 

                    ANDY 
          ...or come to think of it, I 
          suppose I could set it up for you. 
          That would save you some money. 
          I'll write down the forms you need, 
          you can pick them up, and I'll 
          prepare them for your signature... 
          nearly free of charge. 
               (off Hadley's look) 
          I'd only ask three beers apiece for 
          my co-workers, if that seems fair. 

                    TROUT 
               (guffawing) 
          Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, 
          ain't it? Co-workers... 

     Hadley freezes him with a look. Andy presses on: 

                    ANDY 
          I think a nan working outdoors 
          feels more like a man if he can 
          have a bottle of suds. That's only 
          my opinion. 

     The convicts stand gaping, all pretense of work gone. They
     look like they've been pole-axed. Hadley shoots them a look.

                    HADLEY 
          What are you jimmies starin' at? 
          Back to work, goddamn it! 

59     EXT -- LICENSE PLATE FACTORY -- DAY (1949) 59

     As before, an object is hauled up the side of the building by
     rope -- only this time, it's a cooler of beer and ice. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          And that's how it came to pass, 
          that on the second-to-last day of 
          the job, the convict crew that 
          tarred the plate factory roof in 
          the spring of '49... 

60     EXT -- ROOF -- SHORTLY LATER (1949) 60

     The cons are taking the sun and drinking beer. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          ...wound up sitting in a row at ten 
          o'clock in the morning, drinking icy 
          cold Black Label beer courtesy of 
          the hardest screw that ever walked 
          a turn at Shawshank State Prison. 

                    HADLEY 
          Drink up, boys. While it's cold. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          The colossal prick even managed to 
          sound magnanimous. 

     Red knocks back another sip, enjoying the bitter cold on his
     tongue and the warm sun on face. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          We sat and drank with the sun on 
          our shoulders, and felt like free 
          men. We could'a been tarring the 




     roof of one of our own houses. We 
     were the Lords of all Creation. 

     He glances over to Andy squatting apart from the others.

                    RED (V.O.) 
          As for Andy, he spent that break 
          hunkered in the shade, a strange 
          little smile on his face, watching 
          us drink his beer. 

                    HEYWOOD 
               (approaches with a beer) 
          Here's a cold one, Andy. 

                    ANDY 
          No thanks. I gave up drinking. 

     Heywood drifts back to others, giving them a look. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          You could argue he'd done it to 
          curry favor with the guards. Or 
          maybe make a few friends among us 
          cons. Me, I think he did it just to 
          feel normal again...if only for a 
          short while. 

61     EXT -- PRISON YARD -- THE BLEACHERS -- DAY (1949) 61

     Andy and Red play checkers. Red makes his move. 

                    RED 
          King me. 

                    ANDY 
          Chess. Now there's a game of kings. 
          Civilized...strategic... 

                    RED 
          ...and totally fuckin' 
          inexplicable. Hate that game. 

                    ANDY 
          Maybe you'll let me teach you 
          someday. I've been thinking of 
          getting a board together. 

                    RED 
          You come to the right place. I'm 
          the man who can get things. 

                    ANDY 
          We might do business on a board. But 
          the pieces, I'd like to carve those 
          myself. One side done in quartz... 
          the opposing side in limestone. 

                    RED 
          That'd take you years. 

                    ANDY 
          Years I've got. What I don't have 
          are the rocks. Pickings here in the 
          exercise yard are pretty slim. 

                    RED 
          How's that rock-hammer workin' out 
          anyway? Scratch your name on your 
          wall yet? 

                    ANDY 
               (smiles) 
          Not yet. I suppose I should. 

                    RED 
          Andy? I guess we're gettin' to be 
          friends, ain't we? 

                    ANDY 
          I suppose we are. 

                    RED 
          I ask a question? Why'd you do it? 

                    ANDY 
          I'm innocent, remember? Just like 
          everybody else here. 

     Red takes this as a gentle rebuff, keeps playing. 

                    ANDY 
          What are you in for, Red? 

                    RED 
          Murder. Same as you. 

                    ANDY 
          Innocent? 

                    RED 
          The only guilty man in Shawshank. 

62     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 62

     Andy lies in his bunk after lights out, polishing a fragment 
     of quartz by the light of the moon. He pauses, glancing at 
     all the names scratched in the wall. He rises, makes sure 
     the coast is clear, and starts scratching his name into the 
     cement with his rock-hammer, adding to the record. 

63      RAY MILLAND 63

     fills the screen in glorious (and scratchy) black & white, 
     suffering a bad case of DT's... 

64     INT -- PRISON AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT (1949) 64

     ...while a CONVICT AUDIENCE hoots and catcalls, talking back 
     to the screen. We find Red slouched in a folding chair, 
     watching the movie. Andy enters, backlit by the flickering 
     glare of the projector, and takes a seat next to him. 

                    RED 
          Here's the good part. Bugs come out 
          of the walls to get his ass. 

                    ANDY 
          I know. I've seen it three times 
          this month already. 

     Ray Milland starts SCREAMING. The entire audience SCREAMS with 
     him, high-pitched and hysterical. Andy fidgets. 

                    ANDY 
          Can we talk business? 

                    RED 
          Sure. What do you want? 

                    ANDY 
          Rita Hayworth. Can you get her? 

                    RED 
          No problem. Take a few weeks. 

                    ANDY 
          Weeks? 

                    RED 
          Don't have her stuffed down my 
          pants this very moment, sorry to 
          say. Relax. What are you so nervous 
          about? She's just a woman. 

     Andy nods, embarrassed. He gets up and hurries out. Red grins, 
     turns back to the movie. 

65     INT -- AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 65

     Andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark 
     figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and 
     Pete. Andy turns back -- and runs right into Bogs. Instant 
     bear hug. The Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a 
     door open and drag him into -- 

66      THE PROJECTION BOOTH 66

     -- where they confront the startled PROJECTIONIST, an old con
     blinking at them through thick bifocals. 

                    BOGS 
          Take a walk. 

                    PROJECTIONIST 
          I have to change reels. 

                    BOGS 
          I said fuck off. 

     Terrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams 
     and locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room. 

                    ANDY 
          I know. I've seen it three times 
          this month already. 

     Ray Milland starts SCREAMING. The entire audience SCREAMS witt 
     him, high-pitched and hysterical. Andy fidgets. 

                    ANDY 
          Can we talk business? 

                    RED 
          Sure. What do you want? 

                    ANDY 
          Rita Hayworth. Can you get her? 

                    RED 
          No problem. Take a few weeks. 

                    ANDY 
          Weeks? 

                    RED 
          Don't have her stuffed down my 
          pants this very moment, sorry to 
          say. Relax. What are you so nervous 
          about? She's just a woman. 

     Andy nods, embarrassed. He gets up and hurries out. Red grins, 
     turns back to the movie. 

65     INT -- AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 65

                    BOGS 
          Ain't you gonna scream? 

     Andy sighs, cocks his head at the projector. 

                    ANDY 
          They'd never hear me over that. 
          Let's get this over with. 

     Seemingly resigned, Andy turns around, leans on the rewind 
     bench -- and curls his fingers around a full 1.000 foot reel
     of 35mm film. Rooster licks his lips, pushes past the others.

                    ROOSTER 
          Me first. 

                    ANDY 
          Okay. 

     Andy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc, smashing
     it into Rooster's face and bouncing him off the wall. 

                    ROOSTER 
          Fuck! Shit! He broke my nose! 

     Andy fights like hell, but is soon overpowered and forced to his
     knees. Bogs steps to Andy, pulls out an awl with a vicious 
     eight-inch spike, gives him a good long look at it. 

                    BOGS 
          Now I'm gonna open my fly, and 
          you're gonna swallow what I give 
          you to swallow. And when you 
          d mine, you gonna swallow 
          Rooster's. You done broke his nose, 
          so he ought to have somethin' to 
          show for it. 

                    ANDY 
          Anything you put in my mouth, 
          you're going to lose. 

                    BOGS 
          You don't understand. You do that, 
          I'll put all eight inches of this 
          steel ii your ear. 

                    ANDY 
          Okay. But you should know that 
          sudden serious brain injury causes 
          the victim to bite down. Hard. 
               (faint smile) 
          In fact, I understand the bite-reflex 
          is so strong the victim's jaws have 
          to be pried open with a crowbar. 

     The Sisters consider this carefully. The film runs out of the 
     projector, flapping on the reel. The screen goes white. 

                    BOGS 
          You little fuck. 

     Andy gets a bootheel in the face. The Sisters start kicking 
     and beating the living shit out of him with anything they can 
     get their hands on. In the theater, the convicts are CHANTING 
     AND CLAPPING for the movie to come back on. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's 
          mouth, and neither did his friends. 
          What they did do is beat him within 
          an inch of his life... 

67     INT -- INFIRMARY -- DAY (1949) 67

     Andy lies wrapped in bandages. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Andy spent a month in traction. 

68     INT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT -- DAY (1949) 68

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Bogs spent a week in the hole. 

     Bogs sits on bare concrete. The steel door slides open. 

                    GUARD 
          Time's up, Bogs. 

69     INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- 3RD TIER -- DUSK (1949) 69

     Bogs comes up the stairs, smoking a cigarette. Not many 
     cons around; the place is virtually deserted. A VOICE 
     echoes dimly over the P.A. system: 

                    VOICE (O.S.) 
          Return to your cellblocks for 
          evening count. 

     Bogs enters his cell. Dark in here. He fumbles for the light 
     cord, yanks it. The sudden light reveals Captain Hadley six 
     inches from his face, waiting for him. Mert steps in behind 
     Bogs. hemming him. 

     Before Bogs can even open his mouth to say "what the fuck," 
     Hadley rams the tip of his baton brutally into his solar 
     plexus. Bogs doubles over, gagging his wind out. 

70      GROUND FLOOR 70

     Ernie comes slowly around the corner, rolling a steel mop 
     cart loaded with supplies. 

71      2ND TIER 71

     Red is darning a sock in his open cell. He pauses, frowning, 
     hearing strange THUMPING sounds. What the hell is that? 

72      3RD TIER 72

     It's Hadley and Mert methodically and brutally pulping Bogs 
     with their batons, and kicking the shit out of him for good 
     measure. He feebly tries to ward them off. 

73      2ND TIER 73

     Puzzled, Red steps from his cell, following the sound. It 
     dawns on him that it's coming from above. He moves to the 
     railing and leans out, craning around to look up -- 

74      RED'S POV 74

     -- just as Bogs flips over the railing and comes sailing

     directly toward us, eyes bugging out, SCREAMING as he falls. 

75      RED (SLOW MOTION) 75

     jumps back as Bogs plummets past, missing him by inches, arms 
     swimming and trying to grab the railing (but missing that 
     too), SCREAMING aaaaalll the way down -- 

76      GROUND FLOOR 76

     -- and impacting on Ernie's gassing mop cart in an enormous 
     eruption of solvents and cleansers. The cart is squashed flat, 
     shooting out from under Bogs and skidding across the cellblock 
     floor like a tiddly wink, kicking up sparks for thirty yards. 
     Ernie is left gaping in shock at Bogs and all the Bogs-related 
     wreckage at his feet. 

77      2ND TIER 77

     Red is stunned. He very tentatively leans out and looks up. 
     Above him, Hadley and Mert lean on the 3rd tier railing. 
     Hadley tilts the cap back on his head, shakes his head. 

                    MERT 
          Damn, Byron. Look'a that. 

                    HADLEY 
          Poor fella must'a tripped. 

     A tiny drop of blood drips off the toe of Hadley's shoe and 

     splashes across Red's upturned cheek. He wipes it off, then 
     looks down at Bogs. Cons and guards are racing to the scene. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Two things never happened again 
          after that. The Sisters never laid 
          a finger on Andy again... 

7B     EXT -- PRISON YARD/LOADING DOCK -- DAY (1949) 78

     Bogs, wheelchair-bound and wearing a neck brace, is loaded 
     onto an ambulance for transport. Behind the fence stand Red 
     and his friends, watching. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          ...and Bogs never walked again. They 
          transferred him to a minimum security 
          hospital upstate. To my knowledge, 
          he lived out the rest of his days 
          drinking his food through a straw. 

                    RED 
          I'm thinkin' Andy could use a nice 
          welcome back when he gets out of 
          the infirmary. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Sounds good to us. Figure we owe 
          him for the beer. 

                    RED 
          Man likes to play chess. Let's get 
          him some rocks. 

79     EXT -- FIELD -- DAY (1949) 79

     A HUNDRED CONS at work. Hoes rise and fall in long waves. 
     GUARDS patrol on horseback. Heywood turns up a rocky chunk, 
     quickly shoves it down his pants. He maneuvers to Red and the 
     others, pulls out the chunk and shows it to them. 

                    FLOYD 
          That ain't quartz. Nor limestone. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          What are you, fuckin' geologist? 

                    SNOOZE 
          He's right, it ain't. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          What the hell is it then? 

                    RED 
          Horse apple. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Bullshit. 

                    RED 
          No, horse shit. Petrified. 

     Cackling, the men go back to work. Heywood stares at the rock.
     He crumbles it in his hands. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Despite a few hitches, the boys 
          came through in fine style... 

80     INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- BACK ROOM -- DAY (1949) 80

     A huge detergent box is filled with rocks, hidden in the 
     shadows behind a boiler furnace. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          ...and by the week Andy was due 
          back, we had enough rocks saved up 
          to keep him busy till Rapture. 

     ANGLE SHIFTS to Red as he plops a bag of "laundry" on the 
     floor. Leonard and Bob toss a few more down. Red starts 
     pulling out contraband, giving them their commissions. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Also got a big shipment in that 
          week. Cigarettes, chewing gum, 
          shoelaces, playing cards with naked 
          ladies on 'em, you name it... 
               (pulls a cardboard tube) 
          ...and, of course, the most 
          important item. 

81     INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1949) 81

     Andy, limping a bit, returns from the infirmary. Red watches 
     from his cell as Andy is brought up and locked away. 

82     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 82

     Andy finds the cardboard tube lying on his bunk. 

                    GUARD (O.S.) 
          Lights out! 

     The lights go off. Andy opens the tube and pulls out a large 
     rolled poster. He lets it uncurl to the floor. A small scrap 
     of paper flutters out, landing at his feet. The poster is the
     famous Rita Hayworth pin-up -- one hand behind her head, eyes
     half closed, sulky lips parted. Andy picks up the scrap of 
     paper. It reads: "No charge. Welcome back." Alone in the dark,
     Andy smiles. 

83     INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- MORNING (1949) 83

     The BUZZER SOUNDS, the cells SLAM OPEN. Cons step from their
     cells. Andy catches Red's eye, nods his thanks. As the men 
     shuffle down to breakfast, Red glances into Andy's cell -- 

84      RED'S POV -- DOLLYING PAST 84


     -- and sees Rita in her new place of honor on Andy's wall. 
     Sunlight casts a harsh barred shadow across her lovely face.

85     INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1949) 85

     Ernie is mopping the floor. He glances back and sees Warden 
     Norton approach the cellblock with an entourage of a DOZEN 
     GUARDS. Still mopping, Ernie mutters to the nearest cell: 

                    ERNIE 
          Heads up. They're tossin' cells. 

     Word travels fast from cell to cell. Cons scramble to tidy up
     and hide things. Norton enters, nods to his men. The guards 
     pair off in all directions, making their choices at random. 

                    GUARD 
          What kind'a contraband you hiding 
          in there, boy? 

     Cells are opened, occupants displaced, items scattered, 
     mattresses overturned. Whatever contraband is found gets 
     tossed out onto the cellblock floor. Mostly harmless stuff. 

     A GUARD pulls a sharpened screwdriver out of a mattress, 
     shoots a nasty look at the CON responsible. 

                    NORTON 
          Solitary. A week. Make sure he 
          takes his Bible. 

                    CON 
          Too goddamn dark to read down there.

                    NORTON 
          Add another week for blasphemy. 

     The man is taken away. Norton's gaze goes up. 

                    NORTON 
          Let's try the second tier. 

86      2ND TIER 86

     Norton arrives, makes a thin show of picking a cell at random.
     He motions at Andy on his bunk, reading his Bible. The door is
     unlocked. Norton enters, trailed by his men. Andy rises. 

                    ANDY 
          Good evening. 

     Norton gives a curt nod. Hadley and Trout start tossing the
     cell in a thorough search. Norton keeps his eyes on Andy,
     looking for a wrong glance or nervous blink. He takes the
     Bible out of Andy's hand. 

                    NORTON 
          I'm pleased to see you reading 
          this. Any favorite passages? 


                    ANDY 
          Watch ye therefore, for ye know not
          when the master of the house cometh. 

                    NORTON 
               (smiles) 
          Luke. Chapter 13, verse 35. I've 
          always liked that one. 
               (strolls the cell) 
          But I prefer: "I am the light of 
          the world. He that followeth me 
          shall not walk in darkness, but 
          shall have the light of life." 

                    ANDY 
          John. Chapter 8, verse 12. 

                    NORTON 
          I hear you're good with numbers. 
          How nice. A man should have a skill. 

                    HADLEY 
          You wanna explain this? 

     Andy glances over. Hadley is holding up a rock blanket, a
     polishing cloth roughly the size of an oven mitt. 

                    ANDY 
          It's called a rock blanket. It's 
          for shaping and polishing rocks. 
          Little hobby of mine. 

     Hadley glances at the rocks lining the window sill, turns to
     Norton. 

                    HADLEY 
          Looks pretty clean. Some contraband 
          here, nothing to get in a twist over. 

     Norton nods, strolls to the poster of Rita. 

                    NORTON 
          I can't say I approve of this... 
               (turns to Andy) 
          ...but I suppose exceptions can 
          always be made. 

     Norton exits, the guards follow. The cell door is slammed and
     locked. Norton pauses, turns back. 

                    NORTON 
          I almost forgot. 

     He reaches through the bars and returns the Bible to Andy. 

                    NORTON 
          I'd hate to deprive you of this. 
          Salvation lies within. 

     Norton and his men walk away. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Tossin' cells was just an excuse. 
          Truth is, Norton wanted to size 
          Andy up. 

87     INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1949) 87

     Andy is working the line. Hadley enters and confers briefly 
     with Bob. Bob nods, crosses to Andy, taps him. Andy turns, 
     removes an earplug. Bob shouts over the machine noise: 

                    BOB 
          DUFRESNE! YOU'RE OFF THE LINE! 

88     INT -- WARDEN NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1949) 88

     Andy is led in. Norton is at his desk doing paperwork. Andy's
     eyes go to a framed needle-point sampler on the wall behind 
     him that reads: "HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON." 

                    NORTON 
          My wife made that in church group. 

                    ANDY 
          It's very pretty, sir. 

                    NORTON 
          You like working in the laundry? 

                    ANDY 
          No, sir. Not especially. 

                    NORTON 
          Perhaps we can find something more 
          befitting a man of your education. 

89     INT -- MAIN BUILDING -- STORAGE ROOMS -- DAY (1949) 89

     A series of bleak rooms stacked high with unused filing 
     cabinets, desks, paint supplies, etc. Andy enters. He hears a
     FLUTTER OF WINGS. An adult crow lands on a filing cabinet and
     struts back and forth, checking him out. Andy smiles. 

                    ANDY 
          Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks? 

     Brooks Hatlen pokes his head out of the back room. 

                    BROOKS 
          Andy! Thought I heard you out here! 

                    ANDY 
          I've been reassigned to you. 

                    BROOKS 
          I know, they told me. Ain't that a 
          kick in the ass? Come on in, I'll 
          give you the dime tour. 

90     INT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1949) 90

     Brooks leads Andy into the bleakest back room of all. Rough
     plank shelves are lined with books. Brooks' private domain.

                    BROOKS 
          Here she is, the Shawshank Prison 
          Library. Along this side, we got 
          the National Geographics. That 
          side, the Reader's Digest Condensed 
          books. Bottom shelf there, some 
          Louis L'Amours and Erle Stanley 
          Gardners. Every night I pile the 
          cart and make my rounds. I write 
          down the names on this clipboard 
          here. Well, that's it. Easy, peasy, 
          Japanesey. Any questions? 

     Andy pauses. Something about this doesn't make any sense.

                    ANDY 
          Brooks? How long have you been 
          librarian? 

                    BROOKS 
          Since 1912. Yuh, over 37 years. 

                    ANDY 
          In all that time, have you ever had 
          an assistant? 

                    BROOKS 
          Never needed one. Not much to it, 
          is there? 

                    ANDY 
          So why now? Why me? 

                    BROOKS 
          I dunno. Be nice to have some 
          comp'ny down here for a change. 

                    HADLEY (O.S.) 
          Dufresne! 

91      ANDY STEPS BACK INTO THE OUTER ROOMS AND FINDS HADLEY WITH 91
     another GUARD, a huge fellow named DEKINS. 

                    HADLEY 
          That's him. That's the one. 

     Hadley exits. Dekins approaches Andy ominously. Andy stands 
     his ground, waiting for whatever comes next. Finally: 

                    DEKINS 
          I'm Dekins. I been, uh, thinkin' 
          'bout maybe settin' up some kinda 
          trust fund for my kids' educations. 

     Andy covers his surprise. Glances at Brooks. Brooks smiles.

                    ANDY 
          I see. Well. Why don't we have a 
          seat and talk it over? 

                    BROOKS 
          Pull down one'a them desks there. 

     Andy and Dekins grab a desk standing on end and tilt it to the
     floor. They find chairs and settle in. Brooks returns with a 
     tablet of paper and a pen, slides them before Andy. 

                    ANDY 
          What did you have in mind? A weekly 
          draw on your pay? 

                    DEKINS 
          Yuh. I figured just stick it in the 
          bank, but Captain Hadley said check 
          with you first. 

                    ANDY 
          He was right. You don't want your 
          money in a bank. 

                    DEKINS 
          I don't? 

                    ANDY 
          What's that gonna earn you? Two and 
          a half, three percent a year? We 
          can do a lot better than that. 
               (wets his pen) 
          So tell me, Mr. Dekins. Where do 
          you want to send your kids? 
          Harvard? Yale? 

92     INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1949) 92

                    FLOYD 
          He didn't say that! 

                    BROOKS 
          God is my witness. And Dekins, he 
          just blinks for a second, then 
          laughs his ass off. Afterward, he 
          actually shook Andy's hand. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          My ass! 

                    BROOKS 
          Shook his fuckin' hand. Just about 
          shit myself. All Andy needed was a 
          suit and tie, a jiggly little hula 
          girl on his desk, he would'a been 
          Mister Dufresne, if you please. 

                    RED 
          Makin' yourself some friends, Andy. 

                    ANDY 
          I wouldn't say "friends." I'm a 
          convicted murderer who provides 
          sound financial planning. That's a 
          wonderful pet to have. 

                    RED 
          Got you out of the laundry, didn't 
          it? 

                    ANDY 
          Maybe it can do more than that. 
               (off their looks) 
          How about expanding the library? 
          Get some new books in there. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          How you 'spect to do that, "Mr. 
          Dufresne-if-you-please?" 

                    ANDY 
          Ask the warden for funds. 

     LAUGHTER all around. Andy blinks at them. 

                    BROOKS 
          Son, I've had six wardens through 
          here during my tenure, and I have 
          learned one great immutable truth 
          of the universe: ain't one of 'em 
          been born whose asshole don't 
          pucker up tight as a snare drum 
          when you ask for funds. 

93     INT -- MAIN BUILDING HALLWAY -- DAY (1949) 93

     DOLLYING Norton and Andy up the hall: 

                    NORTON 
          Not a dime. My budget's stretched 
          thin as it is. 

                    ANDY 
          I see. Perhaps I could write to the 
          State Senate and request funds 
          directly from them. 

                    NORTON 
          Far as them Republican boys in 
          Augusta are concerned, there's only 
          three ways to spend the taxpayer's 
          hard-earned when it come to prisons. 
          More walls. More bars. More guards. 

                    ANDY 
          Still, I'd like to try, with your 
          permission. I'll send a letter a 
          week. They can't ignore me forever. 

                    NORTON 
          They sure can, but you write your 
          letters if it makes you happy. I'll 
          even mail 'em for you, how's that? 

94     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 94

     Andy is on his bunk, writing a letter. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          So Andy started writing a letter a 
          week, just like he said. 

95     INT -- GUARD DESK/NORTON'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1949) 95

     Andy pops his head in. The GUARD shakes his head. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          And just like Norton said, Andy got 
          no answers. But still he kept on. 

96     INT -- PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY (1950) 96

     Andy is doing taxes. Mert Entwhistle is seated across from
     him. Other off-duty guards are waiting their turn. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          The following April, Andy did tax 
          returns for half the guards at 
          Shawshank. 

97     INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- ONE YEAR LATER (1951) 97

     Tax time again. Even more guards are waiting. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Year after that, he did them all... 
          including the warden's. 

98     EXT -- BASEBALL DIAMOND -- DAY (1952) 98

     A BATTER in a "Noresby Marauders" baseball uniform WHACKS the
     ball high into left field and races for first. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Year after that, they rescheduled 
          the start of the intramural season 
          to coincide with tax season... 

99     INT -- PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY (1952) 99

     The Batter sits across from Andy. The line winds out the door.

                    RED (V.O.) 
          The guards on the opposing teams 
          all remembered to bring their W-2's. 

                    ANDY 
          Moresby Prison issued you that gun, 
          but you actually had to pay for it? 

                    THE BATTER 
          Damn right, and the holster too. 

                    ANDY 
          See, that's all deductible. You get 
          to write that off. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Yes sir, Andy was a regular H&R 
          Block. In fact, he got so busy at 
          tax time, he was allowed a staff. 

     ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal Red and Brooks doing filing chores. 

                    ANDY 
          Say Red, could you hand me a stack 
          of those 1040s? 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Got me out of the wood shop a month 
          out of the year, and that was fine 
          by me. 

100     INT -- GUARD DESK/NORTON'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1953) 100

     Andy enters and drops a letter on the outgoing stack. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          And still he kept sending those 
          letters... 

101     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1953) 101

     Dark. Andy's in his bunk, polishing a four-inch length of 
     quartz. It's a beautifully-crafted chess piece in the shape of 
     a horse's head, poise and nobility captured in gleaming stone. 

     He puts the knight on a chess board by his bed, adding it to 
     four pieces already there: a king, a queen, and two bishops. 
     He turns to Rita. Moonlight casts bars across her face. 

102     EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1954) 102

     Floyd runs into the yard, scared and winded. He finds Andy and 
     Red on the bleachers. 

                    FLOYD 
          Red? Andy? It's Brooks. 

103     INT -- PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY (1954) 103

     Floyd rushes in with Andy and Red at his heels. They find 
     Jigger and Snooze trying to calm Brooks, who has Heywood in a 
     chokehold and a knife to his throat. Heywood is terrified. 

                    JIGGER 
          C'mon, Brooksie, why don't you just 
          calm the fuck down, okay? 

                    BROOKS 
          Goddamn miserable puke-eatin' sons 
          of whores! 

     He kicks a table over. Tax files explode through the air. 

                    RED 
          What the hell's going on? 

                    SNOOZE 
          You tell me, man. One second he was 
          fine, then out came the knife. I 
          better get the guards. 

                    RED 
          No. We'll handle this. Ain't that 
          right, Brooks? Just settle down and 
          we'll talk about it, okay? 

                    BROOKS 
          Nothing left to talk about! It's all 
          talked out! Nothing left now but to 
          cut his fuckin' throat! 

                    RED 
          Why? What's Heywood done to you? 

                    BROOKS 
          That's what they want! It's the 
          price I gotta pay! 

     Andy steps forward, rivets Brooks with a gaze. Softly: 

                    ANDY 
          Brooks, you're not going to hurt 
          Heywood, we all know that. Even 
          Heywood knows it, right Heywood? 

                    HEYWOOD 
               (nods, terrified) 
          Sure. I know that. Sure. 

                    ANDY 
          Why? Ask anyone, they'll tell you. 
          Brooks Hatlen is a reasonable man. 

                    RED 
               (cuing nods all around) 
          Yeah, that's right. That's what 
          everybody says. 

                    ANDY 
          You're not fooling anybody, so just 
          put the damn knife down and stop 
          scaring the shit out of people. 

                    BROOKS 
          But it's the only way they'll let 
          me stay. 

     Brooks bursts into tears. The storm is over. Heywood staggers
     free, gasping for air. Andy takes the knife, passes it to Red.
     Brooks dissolves into Andy's arms with great heaving sobs.

                    ANDY 
          Take it easy. You'll be all right. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Him? What about me? Crazy old 
          fool! Goddamn near slit my throat! 

                    RED 
          You've had worse from shaving. 
          What'd you do to set him off? 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Nothin'! Just came in to say 
          fare-thee-well. 
               (off their looks) 
          Ain't you heard? His parole came 
          through! 

     Red and Andy exchange a surprised look. Andy wants to 
     understand. Red just motions to let it be for now. He puts his
     arm around Brooks, who sobs inconsolably. Softly: 

                    RED 

     Ain't that bad, old hoss. Won't be 
     long till you're squiring pretty 
     young girls on your arm and telling 
     'em lies. 

104     EXT -- PRISON YARD BLEACHERS -- DUSK (1954) 104

                    ANDY 
          I just don't understand what 
          happened in there, that's all. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin 
          shithouse, is what. 

                    RED 
          Heywood, enough. Ain't nothing 
          wrong with Brooksie. He's just 
          institutionalized, that's all. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Institutionalized, my ass. 

                    RED 
          Man's been here fifty years. This 
          place is all he knows. In here, 
          he's an important man, an educated 
          man. A librarian. Out there, he's 
          nothing but a used-up old con with 
          arthritis in both hands. Couldn't 
          even get a library card if he 
          applied. You see what I'm saying? 

                    FLOYD 
          Red, I do believe you're talking 
          out of your ass. 

                    RED 
          Believe what you want. These walls 
          are funny. First you hate 'em, then 
          you get used to 'em. After long 
          enough, you get so you depend on 
          'em. That's "institutionalized." 

                    JIGGER 
          Shit. I could never get that way. 

                    ERNIE 
               (softly) 
          Say that when you been inside as 
          long as Brooks has. 

                    RED 
          Goddamn right. They send you here 
          for life, and that's just what they 
          take. Part that counts, anyway. 

105     EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAWN (1954) 105

     The sun rises over gray stone. 

106     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- DAWN (1954) 106

     ANGLE ON RITA POSTER. Sexy as ever. The rising sun sends 
     fingers of rosy light creeping across her face. 

107     INT -- LIBRARY -- DAWN (1954) 107

     Brooks stands on a chair, poised at the bars of a window, 
     cradling Jake in his hands. 

                    BROOKS 
          I can't take care of you no more. 
          You go on now. You're free. 

     He tosses Jake through the bars. The crow flaps away. 

108     EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- MAIN GATE -- DAY (1954) 108

     TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS herald the opening of the gate. It 
     swings hugely open, revealing Brooks standing in his cheap 
     suit, carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat. 

     Brooks walks out, tears streaming down his face. He looks 
     back. Red, Andy, and others stand at the inner fence, seeing 
     him off. The massive gate closes, wiping them from view. 

109     INT -- BUS -- DAY (1954) 109

     Brooks is riding the bus, clutching the seat before him, 
     gripped by terror of speed and motion. 

                    BROOKS (V.O.) 
          Dear Fellas. I can't believe how 
          fast things move on the outside. 

110     EXT -- STREET -- PORTLAND, MAINE -- DAY (1954) 110

     Brooks looks like a kid trying to cross the street without his 
     parents. People and traffic a blur. 

                    BROOKS (V.O.) 
          I saw an automobile once when I was 
          young. Now they're everywhere. 

111     EXT -- BREWSTER HOTEL -- DAY (1954) 111

     Brooks comes trudging up the sidewalk. He glances up as a 
     prop-driven airliner streaks in low overhead. 

                    BROOKS (V.O.) 
          The world went and got itself in a 
          big damn hurry. 

     He arrives at the Brewster. It ain't much to look at. 



112     INT -- BREWSTER HOTEL -- DAY (1954) 112

     A WOMAN leads Brooks up the stairs toward the top floor. He 
     has trouble climbing so many stairs. 

                    WOMAN 
          No music in your room after eight 
          p.m. No guests after nine. No 
          cooking except on the hotplate... 

                    BROOKS (V.O.) 
          People even talk faster. And louder. 

113     INT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- DAY (1954) 113

     Brooks enters. The room is small, old, dingy. Heavy wooden 
     beams cross the ceiling. An arched window affords a view of 
     Congress Street. Traffic noise drifts in. Brooks sets his bag 
     down. He doesn't quite know what to do. He just stands there, 
     like a man waiting for a bus. 

                    BROOKS (V.O.) 
          The parole board got me into this 
          halfway house called the Brewster, 
          and a job bagging groceries at the 
          Foodway... 

114     INT -- FOODWAY MARKET -- DAY (1954) 114

     Loud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. Brooks is bagging 
     groceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. 

                    WOMAN 
          Make sure he double-bags. Last time 
          your man didn't double-bag and the 
          bottom near came out. 

                    MANAGER 
          You double-bag like the lady says, 
          understand? 

                    BROOKS 
          Yes sir, double-bag, surely will. 

                    BROOKS (V.O.) 
          It's hard work. I try to keep up, 
          but my hands hurt most of the time. 
          I don't think the store manager 
          likes me very much. 

115     EXT -- PARK -- DAY (1954) 115

     Brooks sits alone on a bench, feeding pigeons. 

                    BROOKS (V.O.) 
          Sometimes after work I go to the 
          park and feed the birds. I keep 
          thinking Jake might show up and say 
          hello, but he never does. I hope 
          wherever he is, he's doing okay and 
          making new friends. 

116     INT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- NIGHT (1954) 116

     Dark. Traffic outside. Brooks wakes up. Disoriented. Afraid.
     Somewhere in the night, a LOUD ARGUMENT is taking place. 

                    BROOKS (V.O.) 
          I have trouble sleeping at night. 
          The bed is too big. I have bad 
          dreams, like I'm falling. I wake 
          up scared. Sometimes it takes me a 
          while to remember where I am. 

117     INT -- FOODWAY -- DAY (1954) 117

                    BROOKS (V.O.) 
          Maybe I should get me a gun and rob 
          the Foodway, so they'd send me home. 
          I could shoot the manager while I 
          was at it, sort of like a bonus. 

118     INT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- DAY (1954) 118

     Brooks is packing his worldly possessions into the carry bag. 
     Undershirts, socks, etc. 

                    BROOKS (V.O.) 
          But I guess I'm too old for that 
          sort of nonsense anymore. 

119     INT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- SHORTLY LATER (1954) 119

     Brooks is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, 
     puts his hat on his head. The letter lies on the desk, stampe3 
     and ready for mailing. His bag is by the door. 

                    BROOKS (V.O.) 
          I don't like it here. I'm tired of 
          being afraid all the time. I've 
          decided not to stay. 

     He takes one last look around. Only one thing left to do. He 
     steps to a wooden chair in the center of the room, pulls out s 
     pocketknife, and glances up at the ceiling beam. 

     He steps up onto the chair. It wobbles queasily. Now facing
     the beam, he carves a message into the wood: "Brooks Hatlen
     was here." He smiles with a sort of inner peace. 

                    BROOKS (V.O.) 
          I doubt they'll kick up any fuss. 
          Not for an old crook like me. 

120      TIGHT ON CHAIR 120

     His weight shifts on the wobbly chair -- and it goes out 
     from under him. His feet remain where they are, kicking feebly 
     in mid-air. His hat falls to the floor. 

     ANGLE WIDENS. Brooks has hanged himself. He swings gently, 
     facing the open window. Traffic noise floats up from below. 

121     EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- SHAWSHANK -- DAY (1954) 121

     Andy reads the letter to Red and the others: 

                    ANDY 
          P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a 
          knife to his throat. No hard feelings. 

     A long silence. Andy folds the letter, puts it away. Softly: 

                    RED 
          He should'a died in here, goddamn it. 

122     INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1954) 122

     Andy is sorting books on the cart. He replaces a stack on the
     shelf -- and pauses, noticing a line of ants crawling up the
     wood. He glances up. The ants disappear over the top. He pulls
     a chair over and stands on it, peers cautiously over. 

                    ANDY 
          Red! 

     Red steps in with an armload of files. Andy gingerly reaches
     in, grabs a black feathered wing, and pulls out a dead crow.

                    RED 
               (softly) 
          Is that Jake? 

123     INT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1954) 123

     Red is making something at his bench, sanding and planing. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          It never would have occurred to us, 
          if not for Andy. It was his idea. 
          We all agreed it was the right 
          thing to do... 

124     EXT -- FIELDS -- DAY (1954) 124

     Low hilly terrain all around. A HUNDRED CONS are at work in 
     the fields. GUARDS patrol with carbines, keeping a sharp eye.
     We find Andy, Red, and the boys working with picks and 
     shovels. They glance over to the pickup truck. Hadley's 
     chewing the fat with Mert and Youngblood. A WHISTLE BLOWS. 

                    GUARD 
          Water break! Five minutes! 

     The work stops. Cons head for the pickup truck, where water is
     dispensed with dipper and pail. Red and the boys look to Andy.
     Andy nods. Now's the time. The group moves off through the 
     confusion, using it as cover. They head up the slope of a 
     nearby hill and quickly decide on a suitable spot. The 
     guards haven't noticed. 

     Jigger and Floyd start swinging picks into the soft earth, 
     quickly ripping out a hole. Red reaches into his jacket and 
     pulls out a beautiful wooden box, carefully stained and 
     varnished. He shows it around to nods of approval. 

                    ANDY 
          That's real pretty, Red. Nice work. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Shovel man in. Watch the dirt. 

124      CONTINUED 124
     Heywood jumps in and starts spading out the hole. 

125      BY THE TRUCK 125

     Youngblood glances up and sees the men on the slope. 

                    YOUNGBLOOD 
          What the fuck. 

                    HADLEY 
               (follows his gaze) 
          HEY.' YOU MEN UP THERE.' GET YOUR 
          ASSES OFF THAT SLOPE! 
               (works his rifle bolt) 
          YOU HAPPY ASSHOLES GONE DEAF? YOU 
          GOT FIVE SECONDS 'FORE I SHOOT 
          SOMEBODY! 

     Suddenly, other cons start breaking away in groups, dozens of
     them heading toward the slope. The guards look around. 

                    HADLEY 
          What am I, talkin' to myself? 

126      ON THE SLOPE 126

     Andy pulls a towel-wrapped bundle from his jacket and unfolds
     it. Jake. Andy lays him in the box, followed by Brook's 
     letter. Red places the casket in the hole. A moment of 
     silence. Andy gives Red with an encouraging nod. 

                    RED 
          Lord. Brooks was a sinner. Jake was 
          just a crow. Neither was much to 
          look at. Both got institutionalized. 
          See what you can do for 'em. Amen. 

     Muttered "amens" all around. The boys shovel dirt onto the 
     small grave and tamp it down. 

127     INT -- SHAWSHANK CORRIDORS -- DAY (1955) 127

     RAPID DOLLY with Hadley. He's striding, pissed-off, a man on e
     mission. He straight-arms a door and emerges onto -- 

128     EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON WALL -- DAY (1955) 128

     -- the wall overlooking the exercise yard. He leans on the
     railing, scans the yard, sees Andy chatting with Red. 

                    HADLEY 
          Dufresne! What the fuck did you do? 
               (Andy looks up) 
          Your ass, warden's office, now! 

     Andy shoots a worried look at Red, then heads off. 

129     INT -- GUARD DESK/WARDEN'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 129

     Dozens of parcel boxes litter the floor. WILEY, the duty 
     guard, picks through them. Hadley enters, trailed by Andy.

                    ANDY 
          What is all this? 

                    HADLEY 
          You tell me, fuck-stick! They're 
          addressed to you, every damn one! 

     Wiley thrusts an envelope at Andy. Andy just stares at it.

                    WILEY 
          Well, take it. 

     Andy takes the envelope, pulls out a letter, reads: 

                    ANDY 
          Dear Mr. Dufresne. In response to
          your repeated inquiries, the State
          Senate has allocated the enclosed
          funds for your library project... "
               (stunned, examines check) 
          This is two hundred dollars. 

     Wiley grins. Hadley glares at him. The grin vanishes. 

                    ANDY 
          In addition, the Library District
          has generously responded with a
          charitable donation of used books
          and sundries. We trust this will
          fill your needs. We now consider
          the matter closed. Please stop
          sending us letters. Yours truly,
          the State Comptroller's Office.

     Andy gazes around at the boxes. The riches of the world lay at
     his feet. His eyes mist with emotion at the sight. 

                    HADLEY 
          I want all this cleared out before 
          the warden gets back, I shit you not. 

     Hadley exits. Andy touches the boxes like a love-struck man
     touching a beautiful woman. Wiley grins. 

                    WILEY 
          Good for you, Andy. 

                    ANDY 
          Only took six years. 
               (beat) 
          From now on, I send two letters a 
          week instead of one. 

                    WILEY 
               (laughs, shakes his head) 
          I believe you're crazy enough. You 
          better get this stuff downstairs 
          like the Captain said. I'm gonna go 
          pinch a loaf. When I get back, this 
          is all gone, right? 

     Andy nods. Wiley disappears into the toilet, Jughead Comix in 
     hand. Alone now, Andy starts going through the boxes like a 
     starving man exploring packages of food. He doesn't know where 
     to turn first. He gets giddy, ripping boxes open and pulling 
     out books, touching them, smelling them. 

     He rips open another box. This one contains an old phonograph
     player, industrial gray and green, the words "Portland Public
     School District" stenciled on the side. The box also contains
     stacks and stacks of used record albums. 

     Andy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping 
     through them. Used Nat King Coles, Bing Crosbys, etc. 
     He comes across a certain album -- Mozart's "Le Nozze de 
     Figaro." He pulls it from the stack, gazing upon it as a man 
     transfixed. It is a thing of beauty. It is the Grail. 

130     INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 130

     Wiley sits in one of the stalls, Jughead comic on his knees. 

131     INT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 131

     Andy wrestles the phonograph player onto the guards' desk, 
     sweeping things onto the floor in his haste. He plugs the 
     machine in. A red light warms up. The platter starts spinning. 

     He slides the Mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the 
     platter, and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut. The 
     needle HISSES in the groove...and the MUSIC begins, lilting 
     and gorgeous. Andy sinks into Wiley's chair, overcome by its 
     beauty. It is "Deutino: Che soave zeffiretto," a duet sung by 

     Susanna and the Contessa. 

132     INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 132

     Wiley pauses reading, puzzled. He thinks he hears music. 

                    WILEY 
          Andy? You hear that? 

133     INT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 133

     Andy shoots a look at the bathroom...and smiles. Go for broke. 
     He lunges to his feet and barricades the front door, then the 
     bathroom. He returns to the desk and positions the P.A. 
     microphone. He works up his courage, then flicks all the 
     toggles to "on." A SQUEAL OF FEEDBACK echoes briefly... 

134 INT/EXT -- VARIOUS P.A. SPEAKERS -- DAY (1955) 134

     ...and the Mozart is suddenly broadcast all over the prison. 

135     INT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 135

     Wiley lunges to his feet, pants tangling around his ankles. 

136 INT/EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- VARIOUS LOCATIONS -- DAY (1955) 136

     Cons all over the prison stop whatever they're doing, freezing 
     in mid-step to listen, gazing up at the speakers. 

137      THE STAMPING MACHINES IN THE PLATE SHOP ARE SHUT DOWN... 137 

138      THE LAUNDRY LINE GOES SILENT, GRINDING TO A HALT... 138

139      THE WOOD SHOP MACHINES ARE TURNED OFF, BUZZING TO A STOP... 139

140      THE MOTOR POOL...THE KITCHEN...THE LOADING DOCK...THE EXERCISE 140
     thru yard...the numbing routine of prison life itself...all grinds thru
143      TO A STUTTERING HALT. NOBODY MOVES, NOBODY SPEAKS. EVERYBODY 143

     just stands in place, listening to the MUSIC, hypnotized. 

144     INT -- GUARD STATION -- DAY (1955) 144

     Andy is reclined in the chair, transported, arms fluidly 
     conducting the music. Ecstasy and rapture. Shawshank no 
     longer exists. It has been banished from the mind of men. 

145     EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1955) 145

     CAMERA TRACKS along groups of men, all riveted. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I have no idea to this day what 
          them two Italian ladies were 
          singin' about. Truth is, I don't 
          want to know. Some things are best 
          left unsaid. I like to think they 
          were singin' about something so 
          beautiful it can't be expressed in 
          words, and makes your heart ache 
          because of it. 

     CAMERA brings us to Red. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I tell you, those voices soared. 
          Higher and farther than anybody in 
          a gray place dares to dream. It was 
          like some beautiful bird flapped 
          into our drab little cage and made 
          these walls dissolve away...and for 
          the briefest of moments -- every 
          last man at Shawshank felt free. 

146     INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- DAY (1955) 146

     FAST DOLLY with Norton striding up the hallway with Hadley. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          It pissed the warden off something 
          terrible. 

147     INT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 147

     Norton and Hadley break the door in. Andy looks up with a 
     sublime smile. We hear Wiley POUNDING on the bathroom door: 

                    WILEY (O.S.) 
          LET ME OUUUUT! 

148     INT -- SOLITARY WING -- DAY (1955) 148

     LOW ANGLE SLOW PUSH IN on the massive, rust-streaked steel 
     door. God, this is a terrible place to be. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Andy got two weeks in the hole for 
          that little stunt. 

149     INT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT -- DAY (1955) 149

     Andy doesn't seem to mind. His arms sweep to the music still 
     playing in his head. We hear a FAINT ECHO of the soaring duet. 

150     INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1955) 1 50

                    HEYWOOD 
          Couldn't play somethin' good, huh? 
          Hank Williams? 

                    ANDY 
          They broke the door down before I 
          could take requests. 

                    FLOYD 
          Was it worth two weeks in the hole? 

                    ANDY 
          Easiest time I ever did. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Shit. No such thing as easy time in 
          the hole. A week seems like a year. 

                    ANDY 
          I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company. 
          Hardly felt the time at all. 

                    RED 
          Oh, they let you tote that record 
          player down there, huh? I could'a 
          swore they confiscated that stuff. 

                    ANDY 
               (taps his heart, his head) 
          The music was here...and here. 
          That's the one thing they can't 
          confiscate, not ever. That's the 
          beauty of it. Haven't you ever felt 
          that way about music, Red? 

                    RED 
          Played a mean harmonica as a younger 
          man. Lost my taste for it. Didn't 
          make much sense on the inside. 

                    ANDY 
          Here's where it makes most sense. 
          We need it so we don't forget. 

                    RED 
          Forget? 

                    ANDY 
          That there are things in this world 
          not carved out of gray stone. That 
          there's a small place inside of us 
          they can never lock away, and that 
          place is called hope. 

                    RED 
          Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a 
          man insane. It's got no place here. 
          Better get used to the idea. 

                    ANDY 
               (softly) 
          Like Brooks did? 

     FADE TO BLACK 

151      AN IRON-BARRED DOOR 151

     slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room beyond. 
     CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit at a long 

     table. An empty chair faces them. We are again in: 

     INT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1957) 

     Red enters, ten years older than when we first saw him at a 
     parole hearing. He removes his cap and sits. 

                    MAN #l 
          It says here you've served thirty 
          years of a life sentence. 

                    MAN #2 
          You feel you've been rehabilitated? 

                    RED 
          Yes sir, without a doubt. I can say 
          I'm a changed man. No danger to 
          society, that's the God's honest 
          truth. Absolutely rehabilitated. 

     CLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM 

     A big rubber stamp slams down: "REJECTED." 

152     EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DUSK (1957) 152

     Red emerges into fading daylight. Andy's waiting for him.

                    RED 
          Same old, same old. Thirty years. 
          Jesus. When you say it like that... 

                    ANDY 
          You wonder where it went. I wonder 
          where ten years went. 

     Red nods, solemn. They settle in on the bleachers. Andy pulls 
     a small box from his sweater, hands it to Red. 

                    ANDY 
          Anniversary gift. Open it. 

     Red does. Inside the box, on a thin layer of cotton, is a 
     shiny new harmonica, bright aluminum and circus-red. 

                    ANDY 
          Had to go through one of your 
          competitors. Hope you don't mind. 
          Wanted it to be a surprise. 

                    RED 
          It's very pretty, Andy. Thank you. 

                    ANDY 
          You gonna play something? 

     --

     Red considers it, shakes his head. Softly: 

                    RED 
          Not today. 

153     INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE/ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1957) 153

     Men line the tiers as the evening count is completed. The 
     convicts step into their cells. The master switch is thrown 
     and all the doors slam shut -- KA-THUMP! Andy finds a 
     cardboard tube on his bunk. The note reads: "A new girl for 
     your 10 year anniversary. From your pal. Red." 

154     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- LATER (1957) 154

     Marilyn Monroe's face fills the screen. SLOW PULL BACK reveals
     the new poster: the famous shot from "The Seven Year Itch," 
     on the subway grate with skirt billowing up. Andy sits gazing 
     at her as lights-out commences... 

155     INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1957) 155

     ...and we find Red gazing blankly as darkness takes the 
     cellblock. Adding up the months, weeks, days... 

     He regards the harmonica like a man confronted with a Martian 
     artifact. He considers trying it out -- even holds it briefly 
     to his lips, almost embarrassed -- but puts it back in its box
     untested. And there the harmonica will stay... 

     FADE TO BLACK 

156      WE HOLD IN BLACKNESS as THUMPING SOUNDS grow louder... 156

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Andy was as good as his word. He 
          kept writing to the State Senate. 
          Two letters a week instead of one. 

     ...and the BLACKNESS disintegrates as a wall tumbles before 
     our eyes, revealing a WORK CREW with picks and sledgehammers, 
     faces obscured outlaw-style with kerchiefs against the dust. 
     Behind them are GUARDS overseeing the work. 

     Andy yanks his kerchief down, grinning in exhilaration. Red
     and the others follow suit. They step through the hole in the
     wall, exploring what used to be a sealed-off storage room. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          In 1959, the folks up Augusta way 
          finally clued in to the fact they 
          couldn't buy him off with just a 
          200 dollar check. Appropriations 
          Committee voted an annual payment of 
          500 dollars, just to shut him up. 

157     INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1960) 157

     TRACKING the construction. Walls have been knocked down. Men 
     are painting, plastering, hammering. Lots of shelves going up.
     Red is head carpenter. We find him discussing plans with Andy.

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Those checks came once a year like 
          clockwork. 

158     INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1960) 158

     Red and the boys are opening boxes, pulling out books. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          You'd be amazed how far Andy could 
          stretch it. He made deals with book 
          clubs, charity groups...he bought 
          remaindered books by the pound... 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Treasure Island. Robert Louis...

                    RED 
          I got here an auto repair manual, 
          and a book on soap carving. 

                    ANDY 
          Trade skills and hobbies, those go

          ...by Alexandree Dumb-ass. 

                    ANDY 
          Dumas. You boys'll like that one. 
          It's about a prison break. 

     Floyd tries to take the book. Heywood yanks it back. I saw it 
     first. Red shoots Andy a look. 

                    RED 
          Maybe that should go under 
          educational too. 


159     INT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1961) 159

     Red is making a sign, carefully routing letters into a long 
     plank of wood. It turns out to be -- 

160     INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1963) 160

     -- the varnished wood sign over the archway: "Brooks Hatlen 
     Memorial Library." TILT DOWN to reveal the library in all its 
     completed glory: shelves lined with books, tables and chairs, 
     even a few potted plants. Heywood is wearing headphones, 
     listening to Hank Williams on the record player. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          By the year Kennedy was shot, Andy 
          had transformed a broom closet 
          smelling of turpentine into the 
          best prison library in New England. 

161     EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAY (1963) 161

     FLASHBULBS POP as Norton addresses MEMBERS OF THE PRESS: 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          That was also the year Warden Norton 
          instituted his famous "Inside-Out" 
          program. You may remember reading 
          about it. It made all the papers 
          and got his picture in LIFE magazine. 

                    NORTON 
          ...a genuine, progressive advance 
          in corrections and rehabilitation. 
          Our inmates, properly supervised, 
          will be put to work outside these 
          walls performing all manner of 
          public service. Cutting pulpwood, 
          repairing bridges and causeways, 
          digging storm drains... 

     ANGLE TO Red and the boys listening from behind the fence. 

                    NORTON 
          These men can learn the value of an 
          honest day's labor while providing 
          a valuable service to the community 
          -- and at a bare minimum of expense
          to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer! 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Sounds like road-gangin', you ask me. 

                    RED 
          Nobody asked you. 

162     EXT -- HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY (1963) 162

     A ROAD-GANG is grading a culvert with picks. There's dust and 
     the smell of sweat in the air. GUARDS patrol with sniper rifles,
     A pushy WOMAN REPORTER in an ugly hat bustles up the grade, 
     trailed by a PHOTOGRAPHER. 

                    WOMAN REPORTER 
          You there! You men! We're gonna 
          take your picture now! 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Give us a break, lady. 

                    WOMAN REPORTER 
          Don't you know who I am? I'm from 
          LIFE magazine! I was told I'd get 
          some co-operation out here! You 
          want me to report you to your 
          warden? Is that what you want? 

                    HEYWOOD 
               (sighs) 
          No, ma'am. 

                    WOMAN REPORTER 
          That's more like it! Now I want you 
          all in a row with big bright smiles 
          on your faces! Grab hold of your 
          tools and show 'em to me! 

     She turns, motioning her photographer up the grade. Heywood 
     glances around at the other men. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          You heard the lady. 

     Heywood unzips his pants, reaches inside. The others do 
     likewise. The woman turns back and is greeted by the sight of 
     a dozen men displaying their penises and smiling brightly. Her
     legs go wobbly and she sits heavily down on the dirt grade. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          C'mon! We're showin' our tools and 
          grinnin' like fools! Take the damn 
          picture! 

163     INT -- SOLITARY CONFINZMENT -- NIGHT (1963) 163

     Heywood sits alone in the dark. He sighs. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          None of the inmates were invited to 
          express their views... 

164     EXT -- WOODED FIELDS -- DAY (1965) 164

     A ROAD-GANG is pulling stumps, bogged down in mud. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          'Course, Norton failed to mention 
          to the press that "bare minimum of 
          expense" is a fairly loose term. 
          There are a hundred different ways 
          to skim off the top. Men, 
          materials, you name it. And, oh my 
          Lord, how the money rolled in... 

     Norton strolls into view with NED GRIMES at his heels. 

                    NED 
          This keeps up, you're gonna put me 
          out of business! With this pool of 
          slave labor you got, you can 
          underbid any contractor in town. 

                    NORTON 
          Ned, we're providing a valuable 
          community service. 

                    NED 
          That's fine for the papers, but I 
          got a family to feed. The State 
          don't pay my salary. Sam, we go 
          back a long way. I need this new 
          highway contract. I don't get it, I 
          go under. That's a fact. 
               (hands him a box) 
          Now you just have some'a this fine 
          pie my missus baked specially for 
          you, and you think about that. 

     Norton opens the box. Alongside the pie is an envelope. He
     runs his thumb across the thick stack of cash it contains.

     IN THE BACKGROUND, a winch cable SNAPS and whips through the
     air, damn near severing a man's leg. He goes down, screaming
     in mud and blood, pinned by a fallen tree stump. Men rush over
     to help him. Norton barely takes notice. 

                    NORTON 
          Ned, I wouldn't worry too much over 
          this contract. Seems to me I've 
          already got my boys committed 
          elsewhere. You be sure and thank 
          Maisie for this fine pie. 

165     INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- NIGHT (1965) 165

     ANGLE on Maisie's pie. Several pieces gone. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          And behind every shady deal, behind 
          every dollar earned... 

     TILT UP to Andy at the desk, munching thoughtfully as he 
     totals up figures on an adding machine. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          ...there was Andy, keeping the books. 

     Andy finishes preparing two bank deposits. Norton hovers near 
     the desk, keeping a watchful eye. 

                    ANDY 
          Two deposits, Casco Bank and New 
          England First. Night drop, like 
          always. 

     Norton pockets the envelopes. Andy crosses to the wall safe 
     and shoves the ledger and sundry files inside. Norton locks 
     the safe, swings his wife's framed sampler back into place. He 
     cocks his thumb at some laundry and two suits in the corner. 

                    NORTON 
          Get my stuff down t'laundry. Two 
          suits for dry-clean and a bag of 
          whatnot. Tell 'em if they over- 
          starch my shirts again, they're 
          gonna hear about it from me. 
               (adjusts his tie) 
          How do I look? 

                    ANDY 
          Very nice. 

                    NORTON 
          Big charity to-do up Portland 
          way. Governor's gonna be there. 
               (indicates pie) 
          Want the rest of that? Woman can't 
          bake worth shit. 

166     INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1965) 166

     Andy trudges down the corridor with Norton's laundry, the pie 
     box under his arm. 

167     INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 167

     TILT UP FROM PIE to find Red munching away as he helps Andy 
     sort books on the shelves. 

                    RED 
          Got his fingers in a lot of pies, 
          from what I hear. 

                    ANDY 
          What you hear isn't half of it. 
          He's got scams you haven't dreamed 
          of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks. 
          There's a river of dirty money 
          flowing through this place. 

                    RED 
          Money like that can be a problem. 
          Sooner or later you gotta explain 
          where it came from. 

                    ANDY 
          That's where I come in. I channel 
          it, funnel it, filter it...stocks, 
          securities, tax free municipals... 
          I send that money out into the big 
          world. And when it comes back... 

                    RED 
          It's clean as a virgin's whistle? 

                    ANDY 
          Cleaner. By the time Norton retires, 
          I will have made him a millionaire. 

                    RED 
          Jesus. They ever catch on, he's 
          gonna wind up wearing a number 
          himself. 

                    ANDY 
               (smiles) 
          I thought you had more faith in me 
          than that. 

                    RED 
          I'm sure you're good, but all that 
          paper leaves a trail. Anybody gets 
          too curious -- FBI, IRS, whatever -- 
          that trail's gonna lead to somebody. 

                    ANDY 
          Sure it will. But not to me, and 
          certainly not to the warden. 

                    RED 
          Who then? 

                    ANDY 
          Peter Stevens. 

                    RED 
          Who? 

                    ANDY 
          The silent, silent partner. He's 
          the guilty one, your Honor. The man 
          with the bank accounts. That's 
          where the filtering process starts. 
          They trace it back, all they're 
          gonna find is him. 

                    RED 
          Yeah, okay, but who the hell is he?

                    ANDY 
          A phantom. An apparition. Second 
          cousin to Harvey the Rabbit. 
               (off Red's look) 
          I conjured him out of thin air. He 
          doesn't exist...except on paper. 

                    RED 
          You can't just make a person up. 

                    ANDY 
          Sure you can, if you know how the 
          system works, and where the cracks 
          are. It's amazing what you can 
          accomplish by mail. Mr. Stevens has 
          a birth certificate, social 
          security card, driver's license. 
          They ever track those accounts, 
          they'll wind up chasing a figment 
          of my imagination. 

                    RED 
          Jesus. Did I say you were good? 
          You're Rembrandt. 

                    ANDY 
          It's funny. On the outside, I was 
          an honest man. Straight as an 
          arrow. I had to come to prison to 
          be a crook. 

168     EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DUSK (1965) 

                    RED 
          Does it ever bother you? 

                    ANDY 
          I don't run the scams, Red, I just 
          process the profits. That's a fine 
          line, maybe. But I've also built 
          that library, and used it to help a 
          dozen guys get their high school 
          diplomas. Why do you think the 
          warden lets me do all that? 

                    RED 
          To keep you happy and doing the 
          laundry. Money instead of sheets. 

                    ANDY 
          I work cheap. That's the trade-off. 

     TWO SIREN BLASTS draw their attention to the main gate. It 
     swings open, revealing a prison bus waiting outside. 

169     INT -- PRISON BUS -- DUSK (1965) 169

     Among those on board is TOMMY WILLIAMS, a damn good-looking 
     kid in his mid-20's. The bus RUMBLES through the gate. 

170     EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DUSK (1965) 170

     The new fish disembark, chained together single-file. The old- 
     timers holler and shake the fence. A deafening gauntlet. 

171     INT -- CELLBLOCK EIGHT -- NIGHT (1965) 171

     Tommy and the others are marched in naked and shivering, 
     covered with delousing powder, greeted by TAUNTS and JEERS. 

172     INT -- TOMMY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1965) 172

     The bars slam with a STEEL CLANG. Tommy and his new CELLMATE 
     take in their new surroundings. 

                    TOMMY 
          Well. Ain't this for shit? 

173     INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- DAY (1965) 173

     DOLLYING Tommy as he struts along, combing his ducktail, 
     cigarette behind his ear. (We definitely need The Coasters or 
     Del Vikings on the soundtrack here. Maybe Jerry Lee Lewis.) 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 
          1965 on a two year stretch for B&E. 
          Cops caught him sneakin' TV sets 
          out the back door of a JC Penney. 

174     INT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1965) 174

     A SHRIEKING BUZZSAW slices ten-foot lengths of wood. Red runs 
     the machine while some other OLD-TIMERS feed the wood. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Young punk, Mr. Rock n' Roll, cocky 
          as hell... 

     Tommy is hauling the cut wood off the conveyor and stacking it, 
     It's a ball-busting job, but the kid's a blur. 

                    TOMMY 
               (slapping his gloves) 
          C'mon there, old boys! Movin' like 
          molasses! Makin' me look bad! 

     The old guys just grin and shake their heads. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          We liked him immediately. 

175     INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1965) 175

     Tommy regales the old boys with his exploits: 

                    TOMMY 
          ...so I'm backin' out the door, 
          right? Had the TV like this... 
               (mimes his grip) 
          Big ol' thing. Couldn't see shit. 
          Suddenly, here's this voice: 
          Freeze kid! Hands in the air! 
          Well I just stand there holdin' on 
          to that TV, so the voice says: "You 
          hear what I said, boy?" And I say, 
          Yes sir, I sure did! But if I drop
          this fuckin' thing, you got me on 
          destruction of property too!

     The whole table falls about laughing. 

176     INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 176

     Poker game in progress. Tommy, Andy, Red and the boys. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          You did a stretch in Cashman too? 


                    TOMMY 
          Yeah. That was an easy ride, let me 
          tell you. Work programs, weekend 
          furloughs. Not like here. 

                    SNOOZE 
          Sounds like you done time all over 
          New England. 

                    TOMNY 
          Been in and out since I was 13. Name 
          the place, chances are I been there. 

                    ANDY 
          Perhaps it's time you considered a 
          new profession. 
               (the game stalls) 
          What I mean is, you don't seem to 
          be a very good thief. Maybe you 
          should try something else. 

                    TOMMY 
          What the hell you know about it, 
          Capone? What are you in for? 

                    ANDY 
               (wry glance to Red) 
          Everyone's innocent in here. Don't 
          you know that? 

     The tension breaks. Everyone laughs. 

177     INT -- VISITOR'S ROOM -- DAY (1965) 177

     CAMERA TRAVELS the room. Chaotic. CONS are waiting their turn 
     or talking to visitors through a thick plexi shield. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          As it turns out, Tommy had himself 
          a young wife and new baby girl... 

     Tommy's at the end of the row, phone to his ear. Other side of
     the glass is BETH, near tears, fussing with a BABY on her lap.

     BETH 
     ...said we can stay with them, but 
     Joey's gettin' out of the service 
     next month, and they barely got 
     enough room as it is. Plus they got 
     Poppa workin' double shifts and the 
     baby cries half the night. I just 
     don't know where we're gonna go... 

     PUSH IN on Tommy's face as he listens. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Maybe it was the thought of them on 

     the streets...or his child growing 
     up not knowing her daddy... 

178     INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 178

     Tommy enters, the strut gone from his step. A little scared. 
     He finds Andy filing library cards. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Whatever it was, something lit a 
          fire under that boy's ass. 

                    TOMMY 
          I'm thinkin' maybe I should try for 
          high school equivalency. Hear you 
          helped some fellas with that. 

                    ANDY 
          I don't waste time on losers, Tommy. 

                    TOMNY 
               (tight) 
          I ain't no goddamn loser. 

                    ANDY 
          That's a good start. If we do this, 
          we do it all the way. One hundred 
          percent. Nothing half-assed. 

     Tommy thinks about it, nods. 

                    TOMMY 
          Thing is, see... 
               (leans in, mutters) 
          ...I don't read all that good. 

                    ANDY 
               (smiles) 
          Well. You've come to the right 
          place then. 

179     INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 179

     We find Andy giving an impassioned reading: 

                    ANDY 
          ...and the lamplight o'er him
          streaming throws his shadow on the
          floor...and my soul from out that
          shadow that lies floating on the
          floor, shall be lifted nevermore! "

     Andy slaps the book shut, immensely pleased with himself.

                    TOMMY 
          So this raven just sits there and 
          won't go away? 

                    ANDY 
          That's right. 

                    TOMMY 
               (beat) 
          Why don't that fella get hisself a 
          12-gauge and dust the fucker? 

180     INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 180

     Tommy tries to read as Andy looks on: 

                    TOMMY 
          The cat sh--The cat shh... 
               (glances up) 
          The cat shat on the welcome mat? 

     Andy shakes his head. Not exactly. 

181     INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 181

     Andy chalks the alphabet on a blackboard. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          So Andy took Tommy under his wing. 
          Started walking him through his 
          ABCs... 

182     INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1965) 182

     TRACK the table to Tommy and Andy. Discussing a book. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Tommy took to it pretty well, too. 
          Boy found brains he never knew he 
          had. 

183     EXT -- EXERCISE YARD BLEACHERS -- DAY (1965) 183

                    TOMNY 
          The cat sh--shh--shimmied up the 
          tree and crept st--stel--stealthily 
          out on the limb... 

184     INT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1965) 184

     Tommy intent on a paperback, mouthing the words. Behind him,
     wood is piling up on the conveyor belt. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          After a while, you couldn't pry 
          those books out of hands. 

                    RED 
          Ass in gear, son! You're putting us 
          behind! 

     Tommy shoves the book in his back pocket and hurries over.

185     INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 185

     Tommy writes a sentence on the blackboard. Andy steps in, 
     shows him how to reconstruct it. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Before long, Andy started him on 
          his course requirements. He really 
          liked the kid, that was part of it. 
          Gave him a thrill to help a 
          youngster crawl off the shitheap. 
          But that wasn't the only reason... 

186     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 186

     TIGHT ANGLE on chessboard. Most of the pieces complete. PAN TO 
     Andy lying in his bunk, carefully polishing... 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Prison time is slow time. Sometimes 
          it feels like stop-time. So you do 
          what you can to keep going... 

     ...and we keep going past Andy in a SLOW PAN of the cell. 
     Sink. Toilet. Books. Outside the window bars, we hear another 
     TRAIN passing in the night... 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Some fellas collect stamps. Others 
          build matchstick houses. Andy built 
          a library. Now he needed a new project. 
          Tommy was it. It was the same reason 
          he spent years shaping and polishing 
          those rocks. The same reason he hung 
          his fantasy girlies on the wall... 

     ...STILL PANNING, past a chair, a sweater on a hook...and 
     finally to the place of honor on the wall... 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          In prison, a man'll do most 
          anything to keep his mind occupied. 

     ...where the latest poster turns out to be Racquel Welch ins
     fur bikini. Gorgeous. "One Million Years, B. C. " SLOW PUSH IN,

                    RED (V.O.) 
          By 1966...right about the time 
          Tommy was getting ready to take his 
          exams...it was lovely Racquel. 

187     INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 187

     Tommy's taking the big test. Andy's monitoring the time. Deep 
     silence, save for Tommy's pencil-scribbling. A few old-timers 
     are browsing the shelves, sneaking looks their way. Tommy 
     tries to ignore them. Concentrate. 

     Andy clears his throat. Time's up. Tommy puts his pencil down, 

                    ANDY 
          Well? 

                    TOMMY 
          Well. It's for shit. 
               (gets up in disgust) 
          Wasted a whole fuckin' year of my 
          time with this bullshit! 

                    ANDY 
          May not be as bad as you think. 

                    TOMMY 
          It's worse! I didn't get a fuckin' 
          thing right! Might as well be in 
          Chinese! 

                    ANDY 
          We'll see how the score comes out. 

                    TOMMY 
          I'll tell you how the goddamn 
          score comes out... 

     Tommy grabs the test, wads it, slam-dunks it into the trash.

                    TOMMY 
          Two points! Right there! There's 
          your goddamn score! 
               (storms out) 
          Goddamn cats crawlin' up trees, 5 
          times 5 is 25, fuck this place, 
          fuck it! 

     Tommy is gone. Red and others stare. Andy gets up, pulls the 
     test from the trash, smoothes it out on the desk. 

188     INT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1966) 188

     Rest break. Tommy and Red sipping Cokes. 

                    TOMMY 
          I feel bad. I let him down. 

                    RED 
          That's crap, son. He's proud of 
          you. Proud as a hen. 
               (off Tommy's look) 
          We been friends a long time. I know 
          him as good as anybody. 

                    TOMMY 
          Smart fella, ain't he? 

                    RED 
          Smart as they come. Used to be a 
          banker on the outside. 

                    TOMMY 
          What's he in for anyway? 

                    RED 
          Murder. 

                    TOMMY 
          The hell you say. 

                    RED 
          You wouldn't think, lookin' at him. 
          Caught his wife in bed with some 
          golf pro. Greased 'em both. C'mon, 
          boy, back to work... 

     SMASH! Red turns back. Tommy's Coke has slipped from his hand 
     and shattered on the floor. The kid's gone white as a sheet. 

                    TOMMY 
               (bare whisper) 
          Oh my God... 

189     INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 189

     Tommy sits before Andy and Red: 

                    TOMMY 
          'Bout four years ago, I was in 
          Thomaston on a 2 to 3 stretch. 
          Stole a car. Dumbfuck thing to do. 
               (beat) 
          Few months left to go, I get a new 
          cellmate in. Elmo Blatch. Big 
          twitchy fucker. Crazy eyes. Kind of 
          roomie you pray you don't get, know 
          what I'm sayin'? 6 to 12 for armed 
          burglary. Said he done hundreds of 
          jobs. Hard to believe, high-strung 
          as he was. Cut a loud fart, he'd go 
          three feet in the air. Talked all 
          the time, too, that's the other 
          thing. Never shut up. Places he'd 
          been, jobs he pulled, women he 
          fucked. Even people he killed. 
          People that gave him shit, that's 
          how he put it. One night, like a 
          joke, I say: "Yeah? Who'd you 
          kill?" So he says... 

                    BLATCH 
          ...I got me this job one time 
          bussin' tables at a country club. 
          So I could case all the big rich 
          pricks that come in. I pick out 
          this guy, go in one night and do 
          his place. He wakes up and gives 
          me shit. So I killed him. Him and 
          the tasty bitch he was with. 
               (starts laughing) 
          That's the best part! She's fuckin' 
          this prick, see, this golf pro, but 
          she's married to some other guy! 
          Some hotshot banker. He's the one 
          they pinned it on! They got him 
          down-Maine somewhere doin' time for 
          the crime! Ain't that choice? 

     He throws his head back and ROARS with laughter. 

191     INT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 191

     Silence. Tommy has finished his story. Red is stunned...but 
     Andy looks like he's been smacked with a two by four. 

                    RED 
          Andy? 

     Andy says nothing. Walks stiffly away. Doesn't look back. 

192     INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 192

                    NORTON 
          Well. I have to say, that's the 
          most amazing story I ever heard. 
          What amazes me most is you were 
          taken in by it. 

                    ANDY 
          Sir? 

                    NORTON 
          It's obvious this fellow Williams 
          is impressed with you. He hears 
          your tale of woe and quite 
          naturally wants to cheer you up. 
          He's young, not terribly bright. 
          Not surprising he didn't know what 
          a state he'd put you in. 

                    ANDY 
          I think he's telling the truth. 

                    NORTON 
          Let's say for a moment Blatch does 
          exist. You think he'd just fall to 
          his knees and cry, "Yes, I did it! 
          I confess! By all means, please add
          a life term to my sentence!" 

                    ANDY 
          It wouldn't matter. With Tommy's 
          testimony, I can get a new trial. 

                    NORTON 
          That's assuming Blatch is even 
          still there. Chances are excellent 
          he'd be released by now. Excellent.

                    ANDY 
          They'd have his last known address.
          Names of relatives... 
               (Norton shakes his head)
          Well it's a chance. isn't it? How
          can you be so obtuse? 

                    NORTON 
          What? What did you call me? 

                    ANDY 
          Obtuse! Is it deliberate? The 
          country club will have his old time
          cards! W-2s with his name on them! 

                    NORTON 
               (rises) 
          Dufresne, if you want to indulge 
          this fantasy, that's your business.
          Don't make it mine. This meeting's 
          over. 

                    ANDY 
          Look, if it's the squeeze, don't 
          worry. I'd never say what goes on 
          in here. I'd be just as indictable 
          as you for laundering the money! 

                    NORTON 
          Don't you ever mention money to me 
          again, you sorry son of a bitch! 
          Not in this office, not anywhere! 
               (slaps intercom) 
          Get in here! Now! 

                    ANDY 
          I was just trying to rest your mind
          at ease, that's all. 

                    NORTON 
               (as GUARDS enter) 
          Solitary! A month! 

     Andy gets dragged away, kicking and screaming: 

                    ANDY 
          What's the matter with you? It's my 
          chance to get out, don't you see 
          that? It's my life! Don't you 
          understand it's my life? 

193     EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1966) 193

     Mail call. Men crowd around as names are called out. Red and
     the boys are parked on the bleachers. 

                    FLOYD 
          A month in the hole. Longest damn 
          stretch I ever heard of. 

                    TOMMY 
          It's my fault. 

                    RED 
          Like hell. You didn't pull the 
          trigger, and you didn't convict him. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Red? You saying Andy's innocent? I 
          mean for real innocent? 
               (Red nods) 
          Sweet Jesus. How long's he been in 
          here? 

                    RED 
          Since '47. Going on nineteen years. 

                    MAIL CALLER 
          Thomas Williams! 

     Tommy raises his hand. The envelope gets tossed to him. He
     stares at it. Red peers over his shoulder. 

                    RED 
          Board of Education. 

                    TOMMY 
          The son of a bitch mailed it. 

                    RED 
          Looks that way. You gonna open it 
          or stick your thumb up your butt? 

                    TOMMY 
          Thumb up my butt sounds better. 

     He gets hemmed in by the older men. Red snatches the letter. 

                    TOMMY 
          C'mon, just throw it away. Will you 
          please? Just throw it away? 

     Red rips it open, scans the letter. Expressionless. 

                    RED 
          Well, shit. 

194     INT -- VISITOR'S ROOM -- DAY (1966) 194

     Tommy makes his way through the chaos, finds Beth and the baby 
     waiting behind the thick plexi shield. He sits, doesn't pick 
     up the phone. Just stares at Beth. She doesn't know what to 
     make of it. 

     He presses a piece of paper against the glass. A high school 
     diploma. Her face lights up, blinking back tears. 

195     INT -- SOLITARY WING -- NIGHT (1966) 195

     LOW ANGLE on steel door. Somewhere behind it, unseen, is Andy, 
     A rat scurries along the wall. FOOTSTEPS approach slowly. 

196     INT -- SOLITARY -- NIGHT (1966) 196

     Andy listens in darkness. The FOOTSTEPS pause outside his 
     door. The slot opens. An ELDERLY GUARD peers in. 

                    ELDERLY GUARD 
          Kid passed. C-plus average. Thought 
          you'd like to know. 

     The slot closes. The FOOTSTEPS recede. Andy smiles. 

197     INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1966) 197

     We find Tommy on evening work detail, mopping the floors with 
     bucket and pail. Mert Entwhistle comes into view. 

                    MERT 
          Warden wants to talk. 

198     EXT -- PRISON -- NIGHT (1966) 198

     A steel door rattles open. Mert leads Tommy outside to a gate, 
     unlocks it. Tommy looks around. 

                    TOMMY 
          Out here? 

                    MERT 
          That's what the man said. 

     Mert swings the gate open, sends Tommy through, turns and 
     heads back inside. Tommy proceeds out across a loading-dock
     access for the shops and mills. Some vehicles parked. The 
     place is deserted. He stops, sensing a presence. 

                    TOMMY 
          Warden? 

     Norton steps into the light. 

                    NORTON 
          Tommy, we've got a situation here. 
          I think you can appreciate that. 

                    TOMMY 
          Yes sir, I sure can. 

                    NORTON 
          I tell you, son, this really came 
          along and knocked my wind out. It's 
          got me up nights, that's the truth. 

     Norton pulls a pack of cigarettes, offers Tommy a smoke. Tommy
     takes one. Norton lights both cigarettes, pockets his lighter.

                    NORTON 
          The right decision. Sometimes it's 
          hard to figure out what that is. 
          You understand? 
               (Tommy nods) 
          Think hard, Tommy. If I'm gonna 
          move on this, there can't be the 
          least little shred of doubt. I have 
          to know if you what you told 
          Dufresne was the truth. 

                    TOMMY 
          Yes sir. Absolutely. 

                    NORTON 
          Would you be willing to swear before 
          a judge and jury...having placed 
          your hand on the Good Book and taken 
          an oath before Almighty God Himself? 

                    TOMMY 
          Just gimme that chance. 

                    NORTON 
          That's what I thought. 

     Norton drops his cigarette. Crushes it out with the toe of his 
     shoe. Glances up toward the plate shop roof as -- 

199      HIGH ANGLE FROM PLATE SHOP ROOF (SNIPER POV) 199

     -- a rifle scope pops up into frame, jumping Tommy's image 
     into startling magnification, framed in the crosshairs. 

200      THE SNIPER 200

     rapid-fires a carbine -- BLAM!BLAM!BLAM!BLAM! -- his face lit 
     up by the muzzle flashes. Captain Hadley. 

201      TOMMY 201

     gets chewed to pieces by the gunfire. He smacks the ground in 
     a twitching, thrashing heap. Eyes wide and staring. Dead. 
     Surprise still stamped on his face. Silence now. Norton 
     turns, strolls into darkness. 

202     INT -- SOLITARY WING -- DAY (1966) 202

     GUARDS approach Andy's cell. The door is unlocked. Andy 
     emerges slowly, blinking painfully at the light. 

203 INT/EXT -- PRISON -- DAY (1966) 203

     Andy is marched along. Convicts stop to stare. 

204     INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 204

     Andy is led in. The door is closed. Alone with Norton. Softly, 

                    NORTON 
          Terrible thing. Man that young, 
          less than a year to go, trying to 
          escape. Broke Captain Hadley's 
          heart to shoot him, truly it did. 

                    ANDY 
          I'm done. It stops right now. Get 
          H&R Block to declare your income. 

     Norton lunges to his feet, eyes sparkling with rage. 

                    NORTON 
          Nothing stops! NOTHING! 
               (tight) 
          Or you will do the hardest time 
          there is. No more protection from 
          the guards. I'll pull you out of 
          that one-bunk Hilton and put you in 
               (MORE) 

     -
                    NORTON (cont.) 
          with the biggest bull queer I can 
          find. You'll think you got fucked 
          by a train! And the library? Gone! 
          Sealed off brick by brick! We'll 
          have us a little book-barbecue in 
          the yard! They'll see the flames 
          for miles! We'll dance around it 
          like wild Indians! Do you understand 
          me? Are you catching my drift? 

     SLOW PUSH IN on Andy's face. Eyes hollow. His beaten 
     expression says it all... 

205     EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1966) 205

     Red finds Andy sitting in the shadow of the high stone wall, 
     poking listlessly through the dust for small pebbles. Red 
     waits for some acknowledgment. Andy doesn't even look up. 
     Red hunkers down and joins him. Nothing is said for the 
     longest time. And then, softly: 

                    ANDY 
          My wife used to say I'm a hard man 
          to know. Like a closed book. 
          Complained about it all the time. 
               (pause) 
          She was beautiful. I loved her. But 
          I guess I couldn't show it enough. 
               (softly) 
          I killed her, Red. 

     Andy finally glances to Red, seeking a reaction. Silence. 

                    ANDY 
          I didn't pull the trigger. But I 
          drove her away. That's why she 
          died. Because of me, the way I am. 

                    RED 
          That don't make you a murderer. Bad 
          husband, maybe. 

     Andy smiles faintly in spite of himself. Red gives his 

     shoulder a squeeze. 

                    RED 
          Feel bad about it if you want. But 
          you didn't pull the trigger. 

                    ANDY 
          No. I didn't. Someone else did, and 
          I wound up here. Bad luck, I guess. 

                    RED 
          Bad luck? Jesus. 

                    ANDY 
          It floats around. Has to land on 
          somebody. Say a storm comes 
          through. Some folks sit in their 
          living rooms and enjoy the rain. 
          The house next door gets torn out 
          of the ground and smashed flat. It 
          was my turn, that's all. I was in 
          the path of the tornado. 
               (softly) 
          I just had no idea the storm would 
          go on as long as it has. 
               (glances to him) 
          Think you'll ever get out of here? 

                    RED 
          Sure. When I got a long white beard 
          and about three marbles left 
          rolling around upstairs. 

                    ANDY 
          Tell you where I'd go. Zihuatanejo.

                    RED 
          Zihuatanejo? 

                    ANDY 
          Mexico. Little place right on the 
          Pacific. You know what the Mexicans 
          say about the Pacific? They say it 
          has no memory. That's where I'd 
          like to finish out my life, Red. A 
          warm place with no memory. Open a 
          little hotel right on the beach. 
          Buy some worthless old boat and fix 
          it up like new. Take my guests out 
          charter fishing. 
               (beat) 
          You know, a place like that, I'd 
          need a man who can get things. 

     Red stares at Andy, laughs. 

                    RED 
          Jesus, Andy. I couldn't hack it on 
          the outside. Been in here too long. 
          I'm an institutional man now. Like 
          old Brooks Hatlen was. 

                    ANDY 
          You underestimate yourself. 

     -

                    RED 
          Bullshit. In here I'm the guy who 
          can get it for you. Out there, all 
          you need are Yellow Pages. I 
          wouldn't know where to begin. 
               (derisive snort) 
          Pacific Ocean? Hell. Like to scare 
          me to death, somethin' that big. 

                    ANDY 
          Not me. I didn't shoot my wife and 
          I didn't shoot her lover, and 
          whatever mistakes I made I've paid 
          for and then some. That hotel and 
          that boat...I don't think it's too 
          much to want. To look at the stars 
          just after sunset. Touch the sand. 
          Wade in the water. Feel free. 

                    RED 
          Goddamn it, Andy, stop! Don't do 
          that to yourself! Talking shitty 
          pipedreams! Mexico's down there, 
          and you're in here, and that's the 
          way it is! 

                    ANDY 
          You're right. It's down there, and 
          I'm in here. I guess it comes down 
          to a simple choice, really. Get 
          busy living or get busy dying. 

     Red snaps a look. What the hell does that mean? Andy rises and
     walks away. Red lunges to his feet. 

                    RED 
          Andy? 

                    ANDY 
               (turns back) 
          Red, if you ever get out of here, 
          do me a favor. There's this big 
          hayfield up near Buxton. You know 
          where Buxton is? 

                    RED 
               (nods) 
          Lots of hayfields there. 

                    ANDY 
          One in particular. Got a long rock 
          wall with a big oak at the north 
          end. Like something out of a Robert 
          Frost poem. It's where I asked my 
               (MORE) 



                    ANDY (cont.) 
          wife to marry me. We'd gone for a 
          picnic. We made love under that 
          tree. I asked and she said yes. 
               (beat) 
          Promise me, Red. If you ever get 
          out, find that spot. In the base of 
          that wall you'll find a rock that 
          has no earthly business in a Maine 
          hayfield. A piece of black volcanic 
          glass. You'll find something buried 
          under it I want you to have. 

                    RED 
          What? What's buried there? 

                    ANDY 
          You'll just have to pry up that 
          rock and see. 

     Andy turns and walks away. 

206     INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1966) 

                    RED 
          I tell you, the man was talkin' 
          crazy. I'm worried, I truly am. 

                    SKEET 
          We ought to keep an eye on him. 

                    JIGGER 
          That's fine, during the day. But 
          at night he's got that cell all to 
          himself. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Oh Lord. Andy come down to the 
          loading dock today. Asked me for a 
          length of rope. Six foot long. 

                    SNOOZE 
          Shit! You gave it to him? 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Sure I did. I mean why wouldn't I?

                    FLOYD 
          Christ! Remember Brooks Hatlen? 

                    HEYWOOD 
          How the hell was I s'pose to know? 

                    JIGGER 
          Andy'd never do that. Never. 

     They all look to Red. 

                    RED 
          Every man's got a breaking point. 

207     EXT -- PRISON YARD -- ANGLE ON P.A. -- DUSK (1966) 207

                    VOICE (over P.A.) 
          Report to your cellblocks for 
          evening count. 

     BOOM DOWN to Red and the boys. Convicts drift past them.

                    FLOYD 
          Where the hell is he? 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Probably still up in the warden's. 

                    TOWER GUARD 
               (via bullhorn) 
          YOU MEN! YOU HEAR THAT ANNOUNCEMENT 
          OR ZUST TOO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND? 

                    SKEET 
          Christ. What do we do? 

                    FLOYD 
          Nothing we can do. Not tonight. 

                    HEYWOOD 
          Let's pull him aside tomorrow, all 
          of us. Have a word with him. Ain't 
          that right, Red? 

                    RED 
               (unconvinced) 
          Yeah. Sure. That's right. 

20B     INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- NIGHT (1966) 208

     Andy's working away. Norton pokes his head in. 

                    NORTON 
          Lickety-split. I wanna get home. 

                    ANDY 
          Just about done, sir. 

     We follow Norton to his wife's sampler. He swings it aside, 
     works the combination dial, opens the wall safe. Andy moves up,
     shoves in the black ledger and files. Norton shuts the safe. 

                    ANDY 
          Three deposits tonight. 

     Andy hands him the envelopes. Norton heads for the door. 

                    NORTON 
          Get my stuff down t'laundry. And 
          shine my shoes. I want 'em lookin' 
          like mirrors. 
               (pauses at door) 
          Nice havin' you back, Andy. Place 
          just wasn't the same without you. 

     Norton exits. Andy turns to the laundry. He opens the shoebox. 
     Nice pair of dress shoes inside. He sighs, glances down at the 
     old ragged pair of work shoes on his own feet. 

209     INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- NIGHT (1966) 209

     Andy is diligently shining Norton's shoes. 

210     INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1966) 210

     Andy trudges down the hallway, laundry slung over his shoulder, 

211     INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1966) 211

     Andy nods to the GUARD. The guard BUZZES him through. 

212     INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 212

     Red hears Andy coming, moves to the bars. He watches Andy come 
     up to the second tier and pause before his cell. 

                    GUARD (O.S.) 
          Open number twelve! 

     Andy gazes directly at Red. A beat of eye contact. Red shakes 
     his head. Don't do it. Andy smiles, eerily calm...and enters 
     his cell. The door closes. KA-THUMP! We hold on Red's face. 

213     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 213

     Andy is polishing a chess piece. 

                    VOICE (O.S.) 
          Lights out! 

     The lights bump off. He finishes polishing, holds up the piece 
     to admire. A pawn. He sets it down with the others -- and we 
     realize it's the final glance for the board. A full set. 

     He gazes up at Racquel and smiles. Pulls a six foot length of 
     rope from under his pillow. Lets it uncoil to the floor. 

214     INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 214

     Red sits in the dark, a bundle of nerves, trying to hold 

     himself still. He feels like he might scream or shake to 
     pieces. The seconds tick by, each an eternity. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I have had some long nights in 
          stir. Alone in the dark with 
          nothing but your thoughts, time can 
          draw out like a blade... 

     A FLASH OF LIGHTNING outside his window sends harsh barred 
     shadows jittering across the cell. A storm breaking. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          That was the longest night of my 
          life... 

215     INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- MORNING (1966) 215

     KA-THUMP! The master lock is thrown. The cons emerge from 
     their cells and the headcount begins. Red looks back to see if 
     Andy's in line. He's not. Suddenly the count stalls: 

                    GUARD 
          Man missing on tier two! Cell 12! 

     The head bull, HAIG, checks his list: 

                    HAIG 
          Dufresne? Get your ass out here, 
          boy! You're holding up the show! 
               (no answer) 
          Don't make me come down there now! 
          I'll thump your skull for you! 

     Still no answer. Glaring, Haig stalks down the tier, clipboard 
     in hand. His men fall in behind. 

                    HAIG 
          Dufresne, dammit, you're putting me 
          behind! You better be sick or dead 
          in there, I shit you not! 

     They arrive at bars. Their faces go slack. Stunned. Softly: 

                    HAIG 

     Oh my Holy God. 

216      REVERSE ANGLE 216

     reveals the cell is empty. Everything neat and tidy. Even the 
     bunk is stowed. They wrench the door open and rush in, tossing 
     the cell in a panic as if Andy might be lurking under the 
     Kleenex or the toothpaste. CAMERA ROCKETS IN on Haig as he 
     spins toward us, bellowing at the top of his lungs: 

                    HAIG 
          WHAT THE FUCK! 

217     INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- MORNING (1966) 217

     Norton is kicking back with the morning paper. He notices ha
     dingy his shoes are. He glances at the shoebox on the desk. 
     kicks his shoes off, opens the box -- and gulls out Andy's o
     grimy work shoes. He stares blankly. What the fuck indeed. 

     An ALARM STARTS BLARING throughout the prison. He looks up. 

218     EXT -- PRISON -- DAY (1966) 218

     Norton and Hadley stride across the grounds, ALARM BLARING. 

                    NORTON 
          I want every man on that cellblock 
          questioned! Start with that friend 
          of his! 

                    HADLEY 
          who? 

219     INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- RED'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 219

     Red watches as Norton storms up with an entourage of guards.


                    NORTON 
          Him. 

     Red's eyes widen. Guards yank him from his cell. 

220     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 220

     Norton steps to the center of the room, working himself up 
     into a fine rage: 

                    NORTON 
          What do you mean "he just wasn't 
          here?" Don't say that to me, Haig! 
          Don't say that to me again! 

                    HAIG 
          But sir! He wasn't! He isn't! 

                    NORTON 
          I can see that, Haig! You think I'm 
          blind? Is that what you're saying? 
          Am I blind, Haig? 

                    HAIG 
          No sir! 

     Norton grabs the clipboard and thrusts it at Hadley. 

                    NORTON 
          What about you? You blind? Tell me 
          what this is! 

                    HADLEY 
          Last night's count. 

                    NORTON 
          You see Dufresne's name? I sure do! 
          Right there, see? "Dufresne." He 
          was in his cell at lights out! 
          Stands to reason he'd still be here 
          this morning! I want him found! Not 
          tomorrow, not after breakfast! Now! 

     Haig scurries out, gathering men. Norton spins to Red. 

                    NORTON 
          Well? 

                    RED 
          Well what? 

                    NORTON 
          I see you two all the time, you're 
          thick as thieves, you are! He 
          must'a said something! 

                    RED 
          No sir, he didn't! 

     Norton spreads his arms evangelist-style, spins slowly around.

                    NORTON 
          Lord! It's a miracle! Man up and 
          vanished like a fart in the wind! 
          Nothin' left but some damn rocks on 
          the windowsill and that cupcake on 
          the wall! Let's ask her! Maybe she 
          knows! What say there, Fuzzy- 
          Britches? Feel like talking? Guess 
          not. Why should you be different? 

     Red exchanges looks with the guards. Even they're nervous. 
     Norton scoops a handful rocks off the sill. He hurls them at
     the wall one at a time, shattering them, punctuating his words:

                    NORTON 
          It's a conspiracy! (SMASH) That's 
          what this is! (SMASH) It's one big 
          damn conspiracy! (SMASH) And 
          everyone's in on it! (SMASH) 
          Including her! 

     He sends the last rock whizzing right at Racquel. 
     No smash. 

     It takes a moment for this to sink in. All eyes go to her. The 
     rock went through her. There's a small hole in the poster 
     where her navel used to be. 

     You could hear a pin drop. Norton reaches up, sinks his finger 
     into the hole. He keeps pushing...and his entire hand 
     disappears into the wall. 

221      ANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER 221

     as Norton rips the poster from before our eyes. Stunned faces 
     peer in. CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK...to reveal the long 
     crumbling tunnel in the wall. 

222     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- MINUTES LATER (1966) 222

     RORY TREMONT, a guard barely out of his teens, tries not to 
     look nervous as they lash a rope around his chest. He's 
     getting instructions from six different people at once. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          They got this skinny kid named Rory 
          Tremont to go in the hole. He wasn't 
          much in the brains department, but 
          he possessed the one most important 
          qualification for the job... 
               (they slap a flashlight 
          in his hands) 
          ...he was willing to go. 

223     INT -- TUNNEL -- DAY (1966) 223

     Rory squeezes down the tunnel on his belly. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Probably thought he'd win a Bronze 
          Star or something. 

224     INT -- VERTICAL SHAFT -- DAY (1966) 224

     Dark as midnight. Concrete walls rise on both sides. If you 
     imagine them as two huge slices of bread, the meat of this 
     particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark
     tangle of pipes between the cellblocks. Rory's appears, shining
     his flashlight down the shaft. Somewhere, a rat SQUEAKS. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          It was his third day on the job. 

                    RORY 
          Warden? There's a space here 
          between the walls 'bout three feet 
          across! Smells pretty damn bad! 

                    NORTON (O.S.) 
          I don't care what it smells like! 

                    HADLEY (O.S.) 
          Go on, boy! We got a hold of you! 

     Looking none too happy about it, Rory squeezes from the tunnel 
     and dangles into the shaft. He gets lowered, shining his 
     light, smothered by darkness. Not having a good time. 

                    RORY 
          Hoo-whee! Smell's gettin' worse! 

                    NORTON (O.S.) 
          Never mind, I said! Just keep going! 

                    RORY 
          Smells pretty damn bad, Warden! In 
          fact, it smells just like shit. 

     His feet touch the ground -- or what he assumed was the 
     ground. It's not. In fact, it's just what it smells like. He 
     sinks in past his ankles. He slips and sits heavily in it. 

                    RORY 
          Oh God, that's what it is, it's 
          shit. oh my God it's shit. pull me 
          out 'fore I blow my groceries, oh 
          shit it's shit, oh my Gawwwwwwd! 

225     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 225

     Red and others listen to violent barfing from below. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          And then came the unmistakable 
          sound of Rory Tremont losing his 
          last few meals. The whole cellblock 
          heard it. I mean, it echoed. 

     That's it for Red. He starts laughing. Laughing, hell, he's 
     bellowing laughter, laughing so hard he has to hold himself, 
     laughing so hard tears are pouring down his cheeks. The look 
     of rage on Norton's face makes him laugh all the harder. 

226     INT -- SOLITARY WING -- NIGHT (1966) 226

     Abrupt silence. LOW ANGLE on steel door. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I laughed myself right into 
          solitary. Two week stretch. 

227     INT -- SOLITARY -- NIGHT (1966) 227

                    RED 
          It's shit, it's shit, oh my God 
          it's shit... 

     He starts laughing all over again, fit to split. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Andy once talked about doing easy 
          time in the hole. Now I knew what 
          he meant. 

228     EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- WIDE SHOT -- DAY (1966) 228

     Virgin landscape. Charming rural road. Suddenly, State Police
     cruisers rocket up the road with SIRENS AND LIGHTS. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          In 1966, Andy Dufresne escaped from 
          Shawshank Prison. 

229     EXT -- FIELD -- DAY (1966) 229

     Shawshank is half a mile distant. WE TRACK ALONG a muddy creel
     as STATE TROOPERS and PRISON GUARDS scour the brush. A TROOPEE
     fishes a prison uniform out of the creek with a long stick. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          All they found of him was a muddy 
          set of prison clothes, a bar of 
          soap, and an old rock-hammer damn 
          near worn down to the nub. 

     TROOPER g2 pulls the rock-hammer from the weeds. SWISH PAN 
     to a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER. His FLASHBULB GLARE produces: 

230      A BLACK AND WHITE STILL PHOTO 230

     of the hapless cops posing with Andy's reeking uniform and the
     worn rock-hammer. PUSH IN on the hammer. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I remember thinking it would take a 
          man six hundred years to tunnel 
          through the wall with it. Andy did 
          it in less than twenty. 

231     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 231

     Once again, we see Andy using the rock-hammer to scratch his

     name into the cement. Suddenly, a palm-sized chunk of cement 
     pops free and hits the floor. He stares down at it. 

232     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 232

     Andy lies in the dark, studying the chunk of concrete in his 
     hands. Considering the possibilities. Wrestling with hope. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Andy loved geology. I imagine it 
          appealed to his meticulous nature. 
          An ice age here, a million years of 
          mountain-building there, plates of 
          bedrock grinding against each other 
          over a span of millennia... 

233     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 233

     Andy stands peering at the small hole left by the fallen 
     chunk. Carefully runs his fingertip over it. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Geology is the study of pressure 
          and time. That's all it takes, 
          really. Pressure and time. 

234     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1951) 234

     Rita is now on the wall, hanging down over Andy's back. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          That and a big damn poster. 

     TRACK IN to reveal Andy scraping patiently at the concrete. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Like I said. In prison, a man'll do 
          most anything to keep his mind 
          occupied. 

     He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. He smoothes the poster down and 
     dives into bed. A GUARD strolls by a moment later, shining his 
     flashlight into the cell. 

235     EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1953) 235

     Andy strolls along, whistling softly, hands in both pockets. 
     TILT DOWN to his pantleg. Concrete grit trickles out. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          It turns out Andy's favorite hobby 
          was totin' his wall out into the 
          exercise yard a handful at a time... 

236     INT -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT (1962) 236

     A GUARD strolls the tier, shining his flashlight into the 
     cells. He pauses at Andy's bars, playing the beam over the 
     sleeping form huddled under the blankets. 

     p37 REVERSE ANGLE (FROM INS1DE ANDY'S CELL) 237

     We see what the guard doesn't: instead of Andy's head under 
     the blanket, it's a wadded-up pillow. The flashlight plays 
     across the cell, pinning Marilyn Monroe in a circle of light. 

238      ANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER 238

     The light illuminates her face through the paper. WIDEN to 
     reveal Andy lying in his tunnel, holding his breath. The 
     light clicks off. The FOOTSTEPS move on. He gets back to work. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          While the rest of us slept, Andy 
          spent years workin' the nightshift... 

239     INT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT (1965) 239

     BOOMING SLOWLY UP the shaft. Rats scurry the pipes. Suddenly, r
     piece of concrete the size of a quarter jumps free and plummets
     down the shaft as the rock-hammer pushes through. The pick 
     withdraws, replaced by Andy's peering eye. 

240      A SERIES OF DISSOLVES (1965 through 1966) 240

     takes us through the widening of the hole. First as big as a 
     tea cup. Then a saucer. Then a dinner plate. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Probably took him most of a year 
          just to get his head through. 

     Andy finally gets his head through, scraping his ears. He's 
     got a penlight clenched in his teeth. He peers down into the 
     shaft. At the very bottom, maybe 20 feet down, a big ceramic 
     pipe runs the length of the cellblock. Beneath its coat of 
     grime and dust, the word "SEWER" is stenciled. 

241     EXT -- LOADING DOCK ACCESS -- NIGHT (1966) 241

     ANGLE LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN. Below us, Tommy Williams lies 
     facedown at Norton's feet. Blood is spreading, fanning out oa 
     the pavement. Norton turns, strolls out of frame. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I guess after Tommy was killed, 
          Andy decided he'd been here just 
          about long enough. 

     Again we see: Andy working. Norton pokes his head in. 

                    NORTON 
          Lickety-split. I wanna get home. 

                    ANDY 
          Just about done, sir. 

     Norton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial, his back 
     turned. This time, though, we stay on Andy: 

     He pulls up his sweater, yanks out a large black book and a 
     stack of files, lays them on the desk. He then grabs the real 
     ledger and files, jams them down his pants and smoothes his 
     sweater down. He picks up the bogus stack, crosses to Norton, 
     and shoves everything in. 

243     INT -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT (1966) 243

     Norton exits his office and strolls off whistling. PUSH IN on 
     the open door. We see Andy at the guard's desk, pulling 
     Norton's dress shoes from their box. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Andy did like he was told. Buffed 
          those shoes to a high mirror shine. 

244     INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- MINUTES LATER (1966) 244

     Andy sorts through Norton's three suits. He pauses, checking 
     the gray pinstripe. Nice. 

245     INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1966) 245

     The guard BUZZES Andy through. Andy walks toward us. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          The guard simply didn't notice. 
          Neither did I. I mean, seriously, 
          how often do you really look at a 
          man's shoes? 

     TILT DOWN as he passes by. Yep, he's wearing Norton's shoes. 

246     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 246

     The lights go out. Andy places the last chess piece. Gazes up 
     at Racquel. Smiles. Pulls the rope from under his pillow. 
     He stands and unbuttons his prison shirt, revealing Norton's 
     gray pinstripe suit underneath. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the 
     cell, throwing wild shadows. 

247     INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 247

     The storm rages. Andy, naked, carefully slips Norton's folded 
     suit into a large industrial Zip-Lock bag. Next to go in are the
     shoes, chess pieces (already in a smaller bag), black ledger en
     files. Last but not least, a bar of soap wrapped in a towel. 

248     INT -- TUNNEL -- NIGHT (1966) 248

     Andy, again wearing prison clothes, inches down the tunnel. 

249     INT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT (1966) 249

     Andy squeezes through the hole head-first, emerges to the waist,
     He reaches for the opposite wall, manages to snag a steel 
     conduit with his fingers. 

     Suddenly, a huge rat darts for his hand. Andy yanks away and 
     almost plummets head-first down the shaft. He dangles wildly 
     upside-down for a moment, arms windmilling, then gets his 
     hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall. The rat 
     scurries off, pissed. 

     Andy snags the conduit again. He contorts out of the hole and
     dangles into the shaft. We now see the purpose for the rope: the
     plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack,

     He kicks his legs across the shaft, gets his feet braced. Wit3
     his back against one wall and feet against the other, he 
     starts down the shaft. Sliding dangerously. Using pipes for 
     handholds. Flinching as rats dart this way and that, scurrying
     in the shadows. He drops the last few feet to the bottom. 

     He approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it. 
     Pulls out the rock-hammer and says a quick silent prayer. 
     Raises the rock-hammer high and swings it down with all his 
     might. Once, twice -- third time lucky. An enormous eruption 
     of sewage cascades into the air as if rocket-propelled, the 
     Mount St. Helens of shit. Andy is instantly coated black. He 
     turns away and heaves his guts out. The shit keeps coming. 

250     INT -- SEWER PIPE -- NIGHT (1966) 250

     Andy peers down through the hole, playing his penlight aroun5,
     The inside diameter is no more than two feet. Tight squeeze. 
     Coated with crud. It seems to go on for miles. 

     No turning back. He wriggles into the pipe and starts 
     crawling, plastic bag dragging behind. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Andy crawled to freedom through 
          five hundred yards of shit-smelling 
          foulness I can't even imagine. Or 
          maybe I just don't want to. 

251     EXT -- FIELD -- NIGHT (1966) 251

     Rain is falling in solid sheets. Shawshank is half a mile 
     distant. BOOM DOWN to reveal the creek...and PUSH IN toward the 
     mouth of the sewer pipe that feeds into it. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Five hundred yards. The length of 
          five football fields. Just shy of 
          half a mile. 

     Fingers appear, thrusting through the heavy-gauge wire mesh 
     covering the mouth of the pipe. Andy's face looms from the 
     darkness, peering out at freedom. He wrenches the mesh loose, 
     pushes himself out, and plunges head-first into the creek. He 
     comes up sputtering for breath. The water is waist-deep. 

     He wades upstream, ripping his clothes from his body. He gets 
     his shirt off, spins it through the air over his head, flings 
     the shirt away. He raises his arms to the sky, turning slowly, 
     feeling the rain washing him clean. Exultant. Triumphant. A 
     FLASH OF LIGHTNING arcs from horizon to horizon. 

252     INT -- ANDY'S TUNNEL -- DAY (1966) 252

     Once again, we see stunned faces as CAMERA PULLS BACK. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          The next morning, right about the 
          time Racquel was spilling her 
          little secret... 

253     INT -- CASCO BANK OF PORTLAND -- MORNING (1966) 253

     The door opens. Spit-shined shoes enter. DOLLY the shoes to 
     the counter. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          ...a man nobody ever laid eyes on 
          before strolled into the Casco Bank 
          of Portland. Until that moment, he 
          didn't exist -- except on paper. 

                    FEMALE TELLER (O.S.) 
          May I help you? 

     TILT UP to Andy. Smiling in Norton's gray pinstripe suit.

                    ANDY 
          My name is Peter Stevens. I've come 
          to close out some accounts. 

254     INT -- BANK -- SHORTLY LATER (1966) 254

     The teller is cutting a cashier's check while the MANAGER 

     carefully examines Mr. Stevens' various I.D.s. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          He had all the proper I.D. Driver's 
          license, birth certificate, social 
          security card. The signature was a 
          spot-on match. 

                    MANAGER 

     I must say I'm sorry to be losing 
     your business. I hope you'll enjoy 
     living abroad. 

                    ANDY 
          Thank you. I'm sure I will. 

                    TELLER 
          Here's your cashier's check, sir. 
          Will there be anything else? 

                    ANDY 
          Please. Would you add this to your 
          outgoing mail? 

     He hands her a package, stamped and addressed. Gives them a 
     pleasant smile. Turns and strolls from the bank. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen 
          banks in the Portland area that 
          morning. All told, he blew town 
          with better than 370 thousand 
          dollars of Warden Norton's money. 
          Severance pay for nineteen years. 

255     INT -- OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 255

     A MAN in shirtsleeves is going through the mail on his desk. 
     He finds Andy's package, rips it open. Pulls out the black 
     ledger and files. Scans a cover letter. Holy shit. He dashes 
     to his door and yanks it open, revealing the words on the 
     glass: "PORTLAND DAILY BUGLE -- Editor In Chief." 

                    MAN 
          Hal! Dave! Get your butts in here! 

256     INT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAY (1966) 256

     Norton walks slowly toward his office. Dazed. The morning 
     paper in his hand. He goes wordlessly past the DUTY GUARD into 
     his office. Shuts the door. Lays the paper on his desk. 

     The headline reads: "CORRUPTION AND MURDER AT SHAWSHANK." 
     Below that, the sub-headline: "D.A. Has Ledger. Indictments 
     Expected." Norton looks up as SIRENS SWELL in the distance.

257     EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- WIDE SHOT -- DAY (1966) 257

     For the second time, State Police cruisers go rocketing up the
     road with SIRENS AND LIGHTS. 

258     INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 258

     Norton opens his safe and pulls out the "ledger" -- it's 
     Andy's Bible. The title page is inscribed by hand: "Dear 
     Warden. You were right. Salvation lay within." Norton flips to
     the center of the book -- and finds the pages hollowed out in
     the shape of a rock-hammer. 

259     EXT -- PRISON -- DAY (1966) 259

     Police cruisers everywhere. A media circus. REPORTERS jostle
     for position. A colorless DISTRICT ATTORNEY steps forward into
     CLOSEUP, flanked by a contingent of S.ATE TROOPERS. 

                    D.A. 
          Byron Hadley? 

     ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal Captain Hadley. Staring. Waiting. 

                    D.A. 
          You have the right to remain 
          silent. If you give up that 
          right, anything you say will be 
          used against you in court... 

     TROOPERS move in, cuffing Hadley's hands behind his back. The
     D.A. drones on. FLASHBULBS POP. Hadley says nothing. His face
     scrunches up. He begins to cry. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I wasn't there to see it, but I hear 
          Byron Hadley was sobbing like a 
          little girl when they took him away. 

     Hadley sobs all the way to the car. The D.A. snaps a gaze up
     toward Norton's window, motions his men to follow. 

260     INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 260

     Norton is staring out the window as they approach the 
     building. He goes to his desk, opens a drawer. Inside lies a
     revolver and a box of shells. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Norton had no intention of goin' 
          that quietly. 

261     INT -- PRISON CORRIDORS -- DAY (1966) 261

     The D.A. marches along amidst a phalanx of TROOPERS. 

262     INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 262

     Norton sits blankly at his desk, revolver before him. The 
     doorknob rattles, a VOICE is heard: 

                    D.A. (O.S.) 
          Samuel Norton? We have a warrant 
          for your arrest! Open up! 

     The POUNDING starts. Norton dumps the box of bullets out on thr
     desk. He starts sorting them to see which ones he likes. 

263      OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE 263

     Troopers hustle the hapless duty guard to Norton's door as he
     fumbles nervously with a huge key ring. 

                    DUTY GUARD 
          I'm not sure which one it is... 

     He starts trying keys in the lock. And as the keys go sliding
     in one after another... 

264     INT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 264

     ...so do the bullets. Norton is riveted to the door. For every
     key, he loads another bullet. Methodical and grim. He gets the
     final bullet in just as the right key slams home. The door 
     bursts open. Men muscle in. Somebody SHOUTS. Troopers dive in
     all directions as Norton raises the gun -- 

     -- and jams it under his chin. his head snaps back as the wall
     goes red. His swivel chair does a slow half-turn and creaks to
     a final stop. Troopers rise slowly, gazing in horror. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I like to think the last thing that 
          went through his head...other than 
          that bullet...was to wonder how the 
          hell Andy Dufresne ever got the 
          best of him. 

     PUSH SLOWLY to the wall to reveal Mrs. Norton's framed sampler
     trickling blood and brains...and we get our final Bible lesson
     for today: "HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON." 

265     EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1966) 265

     Mail call. Red hears his name. They pass him a postcard. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Not long after the warden deprived 
          us of his company, I got a postcard 
          in the mail. It was blank. But the 
          postmark said, "McNary, Texas." 

266     INT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 266

     Red sits with an atlas, tracing his finger down the page. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          McNary. Right on the border. That's 
          where Andy crossed. 
               (shuts the book) 
          When I picture him heading south in 
          his own car with the top down, it 
          makes me laugh all over again... 

267     EXT -- MEXICO -- HIGHWAY -- DAY (1966) 267

     A red convertible rips along with Andy at the wheel, cigar 
     jutting from his grin, warm wind fluttering his tie. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Andy Dufresne, who crawled through 
          a river of shit and came out clean 
          on the other side. Andy Dufresne, 
          headed for the Pacific. 

268     INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1966) 268

     Heywood is regaling the table with some anecdote about Andy. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Those of us who knew him best talk 
          about him often. I swear, the stuff 
          he pulled. It always makes us laugh. 

     A wild burst of laughter. PUSH IN on Red. Feeling melancholy.

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Sometimes it makes me sad, though, 
          Andy being gone. I have to remind 
          myself that some birds aren't meant 
          to be caged, that's all. Their 
          feathers are just too bright... 

269     EXT -- FIELDS -- LATE DAY (1966) 269

     Convicts hoe the fields. Guards patrol on horseback. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          ...and when they fly away, the part 
          of you that knows it was a sin to 
          lock them up does rejoice...but still, 
          the place you live is that much more 
          drab and empty that they're gone. 

     A DISTANT RUMBLE OF THUNDER. Red pauses, gazes off. Storm 
     clouds coming in, backlit by the sun. A light drizzle begins. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I guess I just miss my friend. 

270     INT -- PRISON CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 270

     Red is sleeping. He wakes with a start. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          But there are times I curse him for 
          the dreams he left behind... 

     He senses a presence, looks over his shoulder. There's a Rita 
     Hayworth poster on his wall. He gets out of bed. Rita just 

     keeps smiling, inscrutable. As Red watches, a brilliant 
     round glow builds behind the poster, shining from the 
     tunnel. The poster rips free, charred to ash in the blink 
     of an eye as a shaft of holy white light stabs into the 
     cell. Sunlight. Red staggers back against the glare. 

     A whirlwind kicks up, whipping everything into the air. The 
     hole in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner -- papers, 
     book, toiletries, bedding -- if it ain't nailed down, it gets 
     sucked down the hole toward the light. Red fights it, but the 
     suction drags him closer and closer... 

271      RED'S POV 271

     ...and CAMERA rockets into the hole, getting sucked down an 
     endless tunnel at impossible speed, the ROAR of air mixing 
     with his drawn-out SCREAM, closer and closer to the light... 

     ...and erupting out the other side into total silence and a 
     beautiful white beach. The Pacific Ocean before us. Enormous. 
     Mind-blowing. Beautiful beyond description. All we hear now 
     are the gentle sound of waves. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          ...dreams where I am lost in a warm 
          place with no memory. 

     A lone figure stands at water's edge. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING, 
     coming up behind him and TRACKING AROUND to reveal -- Red. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          An ocean so big it strikes me dumb. 
          Waves so quiet they strike me deaf. 
          Sunshine so bright it strikes me 
          blind. It is a place that is blue 
          beyond reason. Bluer than can 
          possibly exist. Bluer than my mind 
          can possibly grasp. 

272      AERIAL SHOT 272

     Nothing for a million miles but beach, sky, and water. Red is 
     a tiny speck at water's edge. Just another grain of sand. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I am terrified. There is no way home. 

273     INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 273

     Red wakes from the nightmare. He gets out of bed. Moves to the 
     barred window of his cell. Peers up at the stars. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Andy. I know you're in that place. 
          Look at the stars for me just after 
          sunset. Touch the sand...wade in 
          the water...and feel free. 

     FADE TO BLACK 

274      AN IRON-BARRED DOOR 274

     slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room beyond. 
     CAMERA PUSHES through. SIX MEN AND ONE WOMAN sit at a long 
     table. An empty chair faces them. We are again in: 

     INT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1967) 

     Red enters, sits. 20 years older than when we first saw him.

                    MAN #1 
          Your file says you've served forty 
          years of a life sentence. You feel 
          you've been rehabilitated? 

     Red doesn't answer. Just stares off. Seconds tick by. The 
     parole board exchanges glances. Somebody clears his throat. 

                    MAN #1 
          Shall I repeat the question? 

                    RED 
          I heard you. Rehabilitated. Let's 
          see now. You know, come to think of 
          it, I have no idea what that means. 

                    MAN #2 
          Well, it means you're ready to 
          rejoin society as a-- 

                    RED 
          I know what you think it means. Me, 
          I think it's a made-up word, a poli- 
          tician's word. A word so young fellas 
          like you can wear a suit and tie and 
          have a job. What do you really want 
          to know? Am I sorry for what I did? 

     - ----- 

                    MAN g2 
          Well...are you? 

                    RED 
          Not a day goes by I don't feel 
          regret, and not because I'm in here 
          or because you think I should. I 
          look back on myself the way I 
          was...stupid kid who did that 
          terrible crime...wish I could talk 
          sense to him. Tell him how things 
          are. But I can't. That kid's long 
          gone, this old man is all that's 
          left, and I have to live with that. 
               (beat) 
          Rehabilitated? That's a bullshit 
          word, so you just go on ahead and 
          stamp that form there, sonny, and 
          stop wasting my damn time. Truth 
          is, I don't give a shit. 

     The parole board just stares. Red sits drumming his fingers. 

     CLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM 

     A big rubber stamp SLAMS down -- and lifts away to reveal the 
     word "APPROVED" in red ink. 

275     EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAY 275 

     TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS herald the opening of the main gate. It 
     swings hugely open, revealing Red standing in his cheap suit, 
     carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat. He walks out, still 
     looking stunned. 

276     INT -- BUS -- DAY 276 

     Red rides the bus, clutching the seat before him, gripped by 
     terror of speed and motion. 

277     EXT -- BREWSTER HOTEL -- LATE AFTERNOON 277 

     Red arrives at the Brewster, three stories high and even less 
     to look at than it used to be. 

27B     INT -- BREWSTER -- LATE DAY 278 

     A BLACK WOMAN leads Red up the stairs toward the top floor. 

279     INT -- RED'S ROOM -- LATE DAY 279 

     Small, old, dingy. An arched window with a view of Congress
     Street. Traffic noise floats up. Red enters and pauses, 
     staring up at the ceiling beam. Carved into the wood are the
     words: "Brooks Hatlen was here." 

280     INT -- FOODWAY MARKET -- DAY 280

     Loud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. We find Red bagging 
     groceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. Red 
     calls to the STORE MANAGER: 

                    RED 
          Sir? Restroom break sir? 

                    MANAGER 
               (motions him over) 
          You don't need to ask me every 
          time you go take a piss. Just go. 
          Understand? 

28l     INT -- EMPLOYEE RESTROOM -- DAY 281

     Red steps to the urinal, stares at himself in the wall mirror. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Thirty years I've been asking 
          permission to piss. I can't squeeze 
          a drop without say-so. 

     A strange east Indian guitar-whine begins. The Beatles. George 
     Harrison's "Within You Without You..." 

282     EXT -- STREET -- DAY 282

     ...which carries through as Red walks. People and traffic. He 
     keeps looking at the women. An alien species. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Women, too, that's the other thing. 
          I forgot they were half the human 
          race. There's women everywhere, 
          every shape and size. I find myself 
          semi-hard most of the time, cursing 
          myself for a dirty old man. 

     TWO YOUNG WOMEN stroll by in cut-offs and t-shirts. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Not a brassiere to be seen, nipples 
          poking out at the world. Jeezus, 
          pleeze-us. Back in my day, a woman 
          out in public like that would have 
          been arrested and given a sanity 
          hearing. 

283     EXT -- PARK -- DUSK 283

     Red finds the park filled with HIPPIES. Hanging out. 
     Happening. Here's the source of the music: a radio. A HIPPIE 
     GIRL gyrates to the Beatles, stoned, in her own world. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          They're calling this the Summer of 
          Love. Summer of Loonies, you ask me. 

284     INT -- PAROLE OFFICE -- DAY 284

     Red sits across from his PAROLE OFFICER. The P.O. is filling
     out his report. 

                    P.O. 
          You staying out of the bars, Red? 

                    RED 
          Yes sir. That I am. 

                    P.O. 
          How you doing otherwise? Adjusting 
          okay? 

                    RED 
          Things got different out here. 

                    P.O. 
          Tell me about it. Young punks 
          protesting the war. You imagine? 
          Even my own kid. Oughtta bust his 
          fuckin' skull. 

                    RED 
          Guess the world moved on. 

285     INT -- FOODWAY -- DAY 285

     Bagging groceries. CHILDREN underfoot. One points a toy gun at
     Red, pumping the trigger. Red focuses on the gun, listening to
     it CLICKETY-CLACK. Sparky wheel grinding. 

     The kids get swept off by MOM. Red starts bagging the next 
     customer. SLOW PUSH IN on Red. Surrounded by MOTION and NOISE.
     Feeling like the eye of a hurricane. People everywhere, 
     whipping around him like a gale. Strange. Loud. Dizzying. It
     gets distorted and weird, slow and thick, pressing in on him
     from all sides. The noise level intensifies. The hollering of
     children deepens and distends into LOW EERIE HOWLS. 

     He's in the grip of a major anxiety attack. Tries to shake
     himself out of it. Can't. Fumbles the final items into the
     bag. Walks away. Trying not to panic. Trying not to run. 

     He makes his way through the store. Blinking sweat. He bumps
     into a lady's cart, mumbles an apology, keeps going. Breaks 
     into a trot. Down the aisle, cut to the left, through the door
     into the back rooms, faster and faster, running now, slamming
     through a door marked "Employees Only" into -- 

286     INT -- EMPLOYEE RESTROOM -- DAY 286

     -- where he slams the door and leans heavily against it, 
     shutting everything out, breathing heavily. Alone now. 

     He goes to the sink, splashes his face, tries to calm down. 
     He can still hear them out there. They won't go away. He 
     glances around the restroom. Small. Not small enough. 

     He enters a stall. Locks the door. Puts the toilet lid down 
     and sits on the john. Better. He can actually reach out and 
     touch the walls now. They're close. Safe. Almost small enough. 
     He draws his feet up so he can't be seen if somebody walks in. 

     He'll just sit here for a while. Until he calms down. 

287     EXT -- STREET -- DUSK 287

     Red is walking home. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          There is a harsh truth to face. 
          No way I'm gonna make it on the 
          outside. 

     He pauses at a pawnshop window. An array of handguns. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          All I do anymore is think of ways 
          to break my parole. 

     The SHOPKEEPER appears at the glass, locking the door and 
     flipping the sign: CLOSED. 

288     INT -- RED'S ROOM -- NIGHT 288

     Red lies smoking in bed. Unable to sleep. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Terrible thing, to live in fear. 
          Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all 
          too well. All I want is to be back 
          where things make sense. Where I 
          won't have to be afraid all the time. 

     He glances up at the ceiling beam. "Brooks Hatlen was here." 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Only one thing stops me. A promise 
          I made to Andy. 

289     EXT -- COUNTRY ROAD -- MORNING 289

     A pickup truck rattles up the road trailing dust and pulls to 
     a stop. Red hops off the back, waves his thanks. The truck 

     drives on. Red starts walking. PAN TO a roadside sign: BUXTON. 

290     EXT -- MAINE COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY 290

     High white clouds in a blazing blue sky. The trees fiery with 
     autumn color. Red walks the fields and back-roads, cheap 
     compass in hand. Looking for a certain hayfield. 

291     EXT -- COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY 291

     Walking. Searching. The day turning late. Red finds himself 
     staring at a distant field. There's a long rock wall, like 
     something out o f a Robert Frost poem. Big oak tree. Red checks 
     his compass. North end. He crosses a dirt road into the field. 

292     EXT -- HAYFIELD -- DAY 292

     Red walks the long rock wall, nearing the tree. A squirrel 
     scolds him from a low branch, scurries up higher. Red studies
     the base of the wall. Nothing unusual here. Just a bunch of
     rocks set in stone. He sighs. Fool's errand. Turns to go. 

     Something catches his eye. He walks back, squats, peering 
     closer. Wets a fingertip and rubs a stone. A layer of dust comes 
     off. Volcanic glass. Gleaming black. He tries to get the rock 
     out, anticipation growing. It won't come; it's too smooth. He 
     pulls a pocketknife and levers the rock free. It tumbles at his 
     feet, leaving a ragged hole. 

     Red leans down and solves the mystery at last, staring at the 
     object buried under the rock. Stunned. It's an envelope wrapped 
     in plastic. Written on it is a single word: "Red." 

     Red pulls the envelope out and rises. He just stares at it for 
     a while, almost afraid to open it. But open it he does. Inside 
     is a smaller envelope and a letter. Red begins to read: 

                    ANDY (V.O.) 
          Dear Red. If you're reading this, 
          you've gotten out. And if you've 
          come this far, maybe you're willing 
          to come a little further. You 
          remember the name of the town, 
          don't you? I could use a good man 
          to help me get my project on 
          wheels. I'll keep an eye out for 
          you and the chessboard ready. 
               (beat) 
          Remember, Red. Hope is a good 
          thing, maybe the best of things, 
          and no good thing ever dies. I will 
          be hoping that this letter finds 
          you, and finds you well. Your 
          friend. Andy. 

     By now, tears are spilling silently down Red's cheeks. He 
     opens the other envelope and fans out a stack of new fifty- 
     dollar bills. Twenty of them. A thousand dollars. 

293     INT -- RED'S ROOM -- DAY (1967) 293

     Red is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, puts 
     his hat on. His bag is by the door. He takes one last look 
     around. Only one thing left to do. He pulls a wooden chair to 
     the center of the room and gazes up at the ceiling beam. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Get busy living or get busy dying. 
          That is goddamn right. 

     He steps up on the chair. It wobbles under his weight. 

294     INT -- BREWSTER -- RED'S DOOR -- DAY (1967) 294

     The door opens. Red exits with his bag and heads down the 
     stairs, leaving the door open. CAMERA PUSHES through, BOOMING 
     UP to the ceiling beam which reads: "Brooks Hatlen was here." 

     A new message has been carved alongside the old: "So was Red." 

295     INT -- GREYHOUND BUS STATION -- DAY (1967) 295

     TRACKING SHOT reveals a long line of people at the counter. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          For the second time in my life, I 
          am guilty of committing a crime. 

     CAMERA brings us to Red, next in line, bag by his feet. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          Parole violation. I doubt they'll 
          toss up any roadblocks for that. 
          Not for an old crook like me. 

                    RED 
               (steps up) 
          McNary, Texas? 

296     EXT -- TRAVELING SHOT -- DAY (1967) 296

     A gorgeous New England landscape whizzes by, fields and trees 
     a blur of motion. ANGLE SHIFTS to reveal a Greyhound Sceni- 
     Cruiser barreling up the road, pulling abreast of us. CAMERA 
     TRAVELS from window to window, passing faces. We finally come 
     to Red gazing out at the passing landscape. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I find I am so excited I can barely 
          sit still or hold a thought in my 
          head. I think it is the excitement 
          only a free man can feel, a free 
          man at the start of a long journey 
          whose conclusion is uncertain... 
          297 THE BUS 297

     ROARS past camera, dwindling to a mere speck on the horizon. 

                    RED (V.O.) 
          I hope I can make it across the 
          border. I hope to see my friend 
          and shake his hand. I hope the 
          Pacific is as blue as it has been 
          in my dreams. 
               (beat) 
          I hope. 

298     EXT -- BEACH -- WIDE PANORAMIC SHOT -- DAY (1967) 298

     A distant boat lies on its side in the sand like an old wreck 
     that's been left to rot in the sun. There's someone out there. 

299      CLOSER ON BOAT 299

     A MAN is meticulously stripping the old paint and varnish by 
     hand, face hidden with goggles and kerchief mask. 

     Red appears b.g., a distant figure walking out across the 
     sand, wearing his cheap suit and carrying his cheap bag. 

     The man on the boat pauses. Turns slowly around. Red arrives 
     with a smile as wide as the horizon. The other man raises his 
     goggles and pulls down his mask. Andy, of course. 

                    ANDY 
          You look like a man who knows how 
          to get things. 

                    RED 
          I'm known to locate certain things 
          from time to time. 

     Red shrugs off his jacket and picks up a sander. Together, 
     they start sanding the hull as we 

     FADE OUT 

     THE END
