        FADE IN:

        EXT. WINTER RIVER, CONNECTICUT - DAY

        A crisp and perfect New England town.  Almost too neat
        to be real.  No visible townspeople.  CAMERA EXPLORES
        town.


        CAMERA FLIES

        over a rickety bridge -- PAST the Maitland Hardware and
        Appliance store -- PAST the church -- the Historical
        Society -- UP over the graveyard on the hill and
        finally --

        To the Maitland house.  The perfect Victorian house
        surveying the tiny village.  Suddenly --


        A GIANT DADDY LONGLEGS SPIDER

        mounts the crest of the hill beside the house, pauses to
        wave a spindly leg and then creeps menacingly on top of
        the Maitland house.

                                ADAM (O.S..)
                  Well, well, you're a big fella...!

        A hand -- as big as God's -- with a huge tweezer,
        gently reaches down out of the sky and lies, palm up,
        in the yard next to the house.  Daddy Longlegs climbs
        into it.  The hand rises into the sky again.


        INT. ATTIC - NEW ANGLE - DAY

        Reveals Winter River as a miniature town, while The
        Daddy Longlegs and the hand are normal size.  Above the
        model are a homely representation of moon, sun, and
        stars -- a whole, tiny, mechanical universe to track
        the hours of the day.  A large plat map of the city is
        prominent on the wall.

        The hand is ADAM MAITLAND'S.  In his late 30's, he's a
        solid easy-going citizen.  Capra used to make movies
        about him.

        Adam's model town sprawls across most of the attic
        space.  Windows on either end of the attic shed good
        light into the warm room.  Adam very carefully lifts
        the spider out the open window.  Smiles as he drips him
        lightly on the breeze.


        CAMERA TILTS UP FROM THE WINDOW

        To see the real Winter River, laid out exactly as the
        model, at the foot of the hill.  Adam breathes deeply
        and looks very pleased at the glorious town below him.


        ON HIS HUGE HAND AGAIN

        as it reaches into model and tweezes a tiny sign into
        the tiny window of Maitland's Hardware Store on main
        street.  It reads:

                    ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND
                               ARE
                           ON VACATION!
                              HOORAY!

        Adam leans down and eyes the sign.

                                BARBARA
                         (behind him)
                  I'm ready!

        Adam turns to see entering:  BARBARA MAITLAND, 35 -- a
        wholesome beauty who is mellowing well.  She smiles at
        him.  Perhaps a certain tinge of sadness about her,
        because they don't have children.

                                ADAM
                         (happy to see her)
                  She's ready.

                                BARBARA
                         (eyeing the model)
                  It looks great.

                                ADAM
                         (nodding)
                  Thanks.

        She pushes a wrapped present across the table.

                                BARBARA
                  Happy vacation, honey!

        Adam smiles and gives her a present he's hidden under
        the table.  He opens his present.  A can of furniture
        oil.

                                ADAM
                  Manchurian Tung oil?
                         (playfully grabs
                          Barbara and kisses
                          her)
                  Where did you get it?

                                BARBARA
                  Helen got it for me in Oslo.
                  There's enough to refinish the
                  gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry
                  wardrobe...

        Adam hands Barbara a carefully-wrapped bundle -- she
        unwraps her gift... rolls of very expensive floral
        wallpaper.  She cradles it in her arms like gold leaf.

                                BARBARA
                  Oh, Adam... it's beautiful.

        Adam nods, and embraces her.

                                ADAM
                  Enough to do the guest room...

                                BARBARA
                         (cooing)
                  I'm so glad we're spending our
                  vacation at home...
                         (with a sudden resolve)
                  ... I'm going to get started <u>right</u>
                  <u>now</u>!

                                ADAM
                         (pulling her back)
                  Whoa!... hold on...

        Barbara calms down, returning to Adam's embrace... as:

        PHONE RINGS -- They freeze, then grin.

                                ADAM &amp; BARBARA
                         (unison)
                  No one's home!

        HONK HONK outside.  They look at each other horrified.
        Peer out the window.

                                BARBARA
                  Oh no.

                                ADAM
                         (pointing at her)
                  It's <u>your</u> turn, darling.

        She shakes her head with resignation and goes downstairs.
        KNOCKING on door from below.


        INT. STAIRCASE AND KITCHEN - DAY

        CAMERA FOLLOWS Adam and Barbara downstairs.  We see the
        rambling, old fashioned quality to the house.

        Clean, sentimental, warm and floral.  Some rooms in
        progress.  They continue down the main staircase past
        photos of themselves, old photos of the early days of
        Winter River, pictures and mementos of three
        generations in hardware.  Barbara goes to the kitchen
        and Adam continues down to the basement.


        HER POV - A WOMAN

        JANE BUTTERFIELD -- tall, gawky and aggressive peeks in
        the kitchen door.  She's divorced three husbands and
        buried another for good measure.  She's ruthless but is
        weirdly, seamlessly pleasant.  She waves a legal sized
        paper at them, starts to come inside.


        INT./EXT. KITCHEN DOOR

        Barbara makes dash for it and holds it just as Jane gets
        a foot in.  Jane smiles wildly.

                                JANE
                  Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you.
                  I heard you were on vacation!

                                BARBARA
                  That's right, Jane.  <u>Complete</u>
                  vacation.

                                JANE
                  Honey -- today I am three hundred
                  <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!

                                BARBARA
                  No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the
                  morning!

                                JANE
                  Look at me, think of me as cash!
                  This offer is really real!  From a
                  rich man in New York City who only
                  saw a photograph!
                         (rattles on)
                  My buyer has just made a killing
                  in condos in Manhattan, but he's
                  got a little stress problem...
                         (taps her head)
                  ... so -- he wants to bring the
                  wife and kid for the old peace and
                  quiet.

                                BARBARA
                  That's what we're looking for,
                  too.

                                JANE
                  Barbara Maitland, sweetie, just
                  listen now.  This house is too
                  big.  It really ought to be for a
                  couple with a family.

        That hurts Barbara a little.  She looks at Jane.

                                JANE
                         (continuing)
                  Oh, honey... I didn't mean
                  anything... it's just too big for
                  you.

        Jane compulsively affixes her business card, face inside.
        in the windowpane.

                                BARBARA
                         (shutting door)
                  'Bye, Jane, see you in a few
                  weeks.


        ADAM

        is humming happily, looking for paint brushes in the
        ground floor storeroom.  He spies a cassette deck and
        looks through a stack of cassettes and plays one.  It
        is an old INKSPOTS LOVE SONG.


        INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

        Barbara is starting to paper the walls already.  She
        frowns at the MUSIC.  Goes to the door.

                                BARBARA
                  Oh, honey.  You said no <u>Inkspots</u>
                  on this vacation!

        It CLICKS OFF.  She goes back into the room.


        INT. STOREROOM - DAY

        Adam puts away the tape but keeps humming the song.  He
        opens the shutters on a small window.  ON WINDOW...

                                JANE
                         (her huge face
                          grinning at him)
                  <u>Boo</u>!

        He jumps back, frightened.

                                ADAM
                  No, Jane.

        Adam closes the shutters as Jane affixes yet another
        card to the window.  He continues his search for a
        brush.


        JANE

        exits jauntily, flapping her contract down the lawn.


        INT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

        Adam continues rummaging for a brush.  Can't find it.

                                ADAM
                         (calling to distant
                          Barbara)
                  Honey, come with me down to the
                  store?

                                BARBARA (O.S.)
                  What for?

                                ADAM
                  I need a good brush for this Tung
                  oil and I want to pick up a piece
                  of the model.  Let's go early
                  before anyone sees us.

        Barbara has already papered a few rolls in the guest
        room.

                                BARBARA
                  Okay, but let's hurry back.  You
                  just run in okay?


        EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY

        The Victorian house from the model "in the flesh."
        Adam stands by the station wagon.

        On the bumper of the car is a sticker reading:
        WARNING:  I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS.

        Barbara gets in driver's side.  They drive off.


        INT. THE CAR - DAY

        Adam dusts the inside of the dashboard.  Clean Clean.

                                BARBARA
                         (preoccupied)
                  Jane said we should sell the house
                  to someone with a family.

                                ADAM
                  Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.

        Puts his hand on her shoulder.


        EXT. THE RIVER AND BRIDGE AND HILL - DAY

        We see the car coming down the hill toward the bridge.

                                ADAM (V.O.)
                  We should be flattered that she
                  wants to sell our house.

                                BARBARA (V.O.)
                  I know... I just wish she'd leave
                  us alone.

                                ADAM (V.O.)
                  Let's not think about it.  We'll
                  have a nice romantic, quiet,
                  vacation.  Here comes the bridge
                  chorus.

        Car reaches the rickety covered bridge.  Car shakes,
        bobbing up and down on every plank.

        ON Barbara and Adam TIGHT -- (they've done this routine
        before).  They sing an old Johnny Mathis song.  With a
        lot of vibrato.

                                TOGETHER
                  Chances are... When I wear a
                  foolish grin...

        They laugh.


        EXT. DOWNTOWN WINTER RIVER - DAY

        Just like the model, but real.  And populated.

        CAMERA PAUSES ON a gorgeous storefront with a brass
        lion out front.  Sign above doors says --

                      BOZMAN BUILDING 1835

        An old man polishes the lion as Maitlands drive by and
        wave.

                                BARBARA (V.O.)
                  Wave at the lion.

                                ADAM (V.O.)
                  Don't forget the balls, Ernie.

                                BARBARA (V.O.)
                         (embarrassed)
                  Adam!

        Ernie looks around to see no one's looking and polishes
        the balls of the lion.


        CAMERA SPIES A JAUNTY DOG

        like Benji, peeing on the opposite corner of the lion.
        Maitlands drive by store with sign:

                        JANE BUTTERFIELD
                            ANTIQUES
                           REAL ESTATE
                             TRAVEL


        INT. ANTIQUE STORE REAL ESTATE OFFICE TRAVEL AGENCY -
        DAY

        The store is bursting with antiques of all sorts,
        travel brochures, photographs of houses for sale, and a
        serve-yourself Xerox machine.  LITTLE JANE, her eight-
        year-old daughter is drudgingly making copies.

        Jane, phone in hand, rushes to the window to watch
        Maitlands drive by.  Almost popping the cord when it
        reaches its end.  She's waiting for the other party to
        pick up.

                                JANE
                  Y... ello.  Mrs. Deetz?  Well the
                  condition is what we country folk
                  call, fixin'... Yes, I think they
                  are fixin' to accept another
                  offer.  Well maybe if you offer
                  390,000 they'll take it.


        EXT. MAITLAND HARDWARE - DAY

        Adam sprints up the steps of his lovely hardware store.
        OLD BILL, a slightly-addled ancient barber, is napping
        in a chair in front of his shop, next door to Adam's.
        Adam fumbles with the lock, not interested in conver-
        sation.  He drops his keys, waking Old Bill.

                                OLD BILL
                  'Morning, Adam.  You need a
                  haircut before your vacation?

                                ADAM
                  No thanks, Bill.

                                OLD BILL
                  How's the model coming?

                                ADAM
                  Good, Bill -- Good.

        Bill turns around and continues prattling even though
        Adam has entered.  Bill prattles throughout.

                                OLD BILL
                  Y'know, I was thinkin'... you said
                  Bozman built the foundation in
                  1835 but y'know his grandson came
                  in here last week and said he
                  found a bottle with an 1836 stamp
                  in it plastered in the foundation.
                         (suddenly disgusted
                          at the memory)
                  He's got hair down to his
                  goddamned shoulders...


        INT. MAITLAND HARDWARE

        Adam pulls down a few good paintbrushes and carefully
        picks up a small model of the Bozman building.  He
        walks out.  Old Bill continues unabated.

                                OLD BILL
                  He said "Just give me a trim..." I
                  took a scissors to him so fast...
                  would've skimmed him clean if he
                  hadn't...

        Adam strides by quickly to the car.

                                ADAM
                  See you, Bill.

                                OLD BILL
                  Right.


        EXT. MAITLAND'S CAR - DAY

        The Maitlands drive their car out of town.


        ON JANE


        EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE - DAY

        Car approaches.


        INT. CAR - DAY

        Five brushes sit on the seat next to Adam.  He cradles
        small replica of the Bozman building, complete with
        brass lion.

                                BARBARA
                  It's a beauty.

                                ADAM
                  Yeah it turned out okay.  We
                  applied for a historical plaque
                  for it.  That'll be the third one
                  on Main Street.

                                BARBARA
                         (jokingly)
                  With all these historical
                  landmarks in town, where are they
                  going to put the condominiums?

                                ADAM
                         (grinning)
                  Slow down there, honey... I don't
                  want the vibration to weaken the
                  model.

                                BARBARA
                         (nervous)
                  Oh... I'm sorry...

        Barbara starts to apply the brakes.

        Just before the bridge the dog waddles out in the road.
        Stops to pee.  Barbara swerves.  As the car hits the
        rickety bridge, the speed is just a bit too much.

        Boards RATTLE and loosen, the car skews and catches in
        an open slot, careens to the right, then the left and
        the bridge.


        INT. CAR - DAY

        A piling has smashed through the window on the pas-
        senger side, crushing the upper part of Barbara's
        arm.  She is wailing in pain and fright.

        Adam tries to help Barbara.  He tries to get out of the
        car.  None of this succeeds.


        EXT. BRIDGE AND RIVER - DAY

        The dog finishes, looks over at the car, walks across
        the bridge and steps on the one board which holds the
        car aloft.

        The car rocks back and forth for a moment, and then
        slides forward toward the water.


        EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE

        The car plunges into the rushing water.  It floats
        for a moment, and then sinks like a stone.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK.


        FADE IN:

        INT. BARBARA AND ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

        Quiet, still, expectant.  There is a fire laid in the
        hearth.  Suddenly and for no apparent reason it ignites
        and burns with a furious cheerfulness.

        Barbara and Adam enter, dazed, wet, and bedraggled.

                                BARBARA
                  Something like this <u>always</u> happens
                  when we try to go on vacation.
                  <u>Always</u>.

        Adam leads her toward the fire.

                                ADAM
                  You'll feel better when you're
                  dry.

        He holds out his hands to be warmed.  Barbara comes up
        beside him.  All this time she's been holding her
        injured arm with the other hand.

                                BARBARA
                  This fire wasn't burning when we
                  left the house.

                                ADAM
                  How's your arm?

                                BARBARA
                  I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.

        She holds her arms out to warm them.  One hand catches
        on fire.


        BARBARA'S LEFT ARM

        They stare at it dumbfoundedly before Adam regains his
        senses and snatches it out of the fire.  Two of the
        fingers are burning like candles, and Barbara indus-
        triously blows them out.

                                BARBARA
                  Oh, Adam.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. LIVING ROOM:  A FEW MINUTES LATER - DAY

        They are sitting on the couch together.  Barbara is
        looking away slightly -- as one does when a doctor is
        drawing blood -- while Adam looks at her fingers.  He
        frowns.

        He looks at his skin.  It is pale.  He looks at
        Barbara.

                                ADAM
                  You'd better sit down, hon.

                                BARBARA
                  I am sitting.

                                ADAM
                  I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I
                  don't think we survived that
                  crash.

                                BARBARA
                         (pause)
                  Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own
                  house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some
                  coffee.  You get some more
                  firewood.

        Adam gets up, a little absently, she follows him as he
        wanders to the front door.  He peers out.

                                ADAM
                  Let's take things extra slow.  Do
                  you remember how we got back up
                  here?

        Barbara tests her hand, clenches and unclenches her
        fist.

                                BARBARA
                  I'm fine.  My arm works fine.

        Adam, exploring, opens the door, steps out on the front
        porch.


        EXT. FRONT PORCH - TWILIGHT

        Adam's face is painted with color of sunset.  He stands
        atop the steps leading down to the front yard.  Barbara
        stands just inside the open threshold, looking out
        worriedly.

                                BARBARA
                         (quiet sarcasm)
                  The end of a perfect day.

        Adam starts to step down to the yard.

                                ADAM
                  Honey, I'm gonna go down to the
                  bridge and retrace our steps.

        He steps off the last step into the yard and promptly
        disappears.

                                BARBARA
                  Adam!


        EXT. THE GREAT VOID

        Adam is nowhere.  There's no ground, no sky, nothing to
        stand on or hold onto or give boundaries or distance.
        Just vast nothing.  Not white and not colored either.
        NOISE OF A CLOCK TICKING.

        Adam looks about surprised, doesn't like what he
        doesn't see.  He turns around to head back up the
        steps.  There are no steps.

                                ADAM
                  Barbara?

        His VOICE ECHOES STRANGELY.  He runs off a little in
        the distance, and calls again from over there.

                                ADAM
                         (continuing; quietly)
                  Where are you?

        He goes even farther away.


        IN THE FOREGROUND

        an enormous geared wheel -- the size of a man -- rolls
        by, tearing up the unseamed ground.  Something pours up
        out of the tear -- ooze or stuffing.

        Adam runs forward and stares after the wheel, which is
        now out of sight.


        TWO SMALLER GEARS

        looking very much like components of a giant watch --
        spin along behind him.  One of them veers suddenly
        toward him, and though Adam jumps out of the way, the
        gear snags his trouser leg and shreds it.  LOUD
        TICKING.


        A PERFECTLY ENORMOUS GEAR

        comes barreling toward him.  Adam leaps out of its
        way.  The gear turns, fish-tailing, kicking up ooze and
        stuffing.

        Adam flings himself suddenly to the right, but trips
        into the path of the gear.  As he's about to be
        crushed, he's suddenly jerked up to safety.


        EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

        It's Barbara who's grabbed him, and quite evidently
        saved his life -- not life, perhaps -- but existence.
        He's shaken, breathless.

        Barbara stares at him, as if wondering what he's just
        been through.

                                ADAM
                         (weakly)
                  You saved my -- uh -- life... or
                  whatever...

                                BARBARA
                  Two hours.

                                ADAM
                  What?

                                BARBARA
                  That's how long you were gone.

                                ADAM
                         (pondering that)
                  ... Hmmm?


        INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Barbara leads Adam into the house.

                                ADAM
                  Anything happen while I was away?

                                BARBARA
                  Yes, it did.  Yes, it did.  I made
                  a couple of small discoveries.


        BARBARA

        stands by the mirror over the hearth mantle.  On the
        mantle is Barbara's prize collection of porcelain
        horses.  Adam comes to stand beside her.  They look
        into the mirror, and there is no reflection of them.

        Barbara picks up one of the horses, and trots it through
        the air.  The horse <u>is</u> imaged in the mirror.

                                BARBARA
                         (continuing)
                  There's that, and there's this.

        She picks up an ancient, leather-bound book.  It's
        yellow and worn, about the size of the Boy Scout
        manual.

        CLOSEUP:  Its title is HANDBOOK FOR THE RECENTLY
        DECEASED.

                                ADAM
                         (reading)
                  Handbook for the recently
                  diseased.

                                BARBARA
                  De<u>ceased</u>.  I don't know where it
                  came from.  Look at the publisher.

                                ADAM
                         (he does and reads)
                  Handbook for the Recently Deceased
                  Press.

                                BARBARA
                         (finally admit-
                          ting it)
                  I don't think we survived the
                  crash.


        INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Adam is already in bed, reading from the handbook.
        Barbara is getting ready for bed -- going through a
        ritual of sorts that they practiced every night of
        their married lives.

                                BARBARA
                  I don't like situations like this.
                  I hate it when I'm not in control.
                  So just tell me the basics.

                                ADAM
                  This book isn't arranged that
                  way.  What do you want to know?

                                BARBARA
                  There are a thousand things... Why
                  did you disappear when you walked
                  off the front porch?  Is this a
                  punishment?  Are we halfway to
                  heaven or are we halfway to hell?
                  And how long is this going to
                  <u>last</u>?

                                ADAM
                  I don't see anything about
                  "Rewards and Punishments" or
                  "Heaven and Hell."
                         (frustrated)
                  This book reads like stereo
                  instructions!  Listen to this...
                  'Geographical and Temporal
                  Perimeters... Functional
                  perimeters vary from manifestation
                  to manifestation."  This is going
                  to take some time.


        BARBARA

        paces, she trips on her wallpaper rolls.  Kicks them.

                                BARBARA
                  I knew I'd never finish the guest
                  room.  Adam, we just can't stay in
                  here forever!

        They look at each other, the question hangs in the air.
        Can't they?

        Adam stands and walks to the window.

                                ADAM
                         (thoughtfully)
                  Maybe we should set up a normal
                  routine.

        She looks at him like he's nuts.

                                ADAM
                         (continuing)
                  I mean, let's try to nail down
                  something in our lives.  A regular
                  schedule.  We can keep track of
                  time and go on with our projects
                  up here in the attic.

        She shakes her head, exasperated.  Flops down on the
        bed.

                                BARBARA
                  Oh, God, maybe this is all just a
                  bad dream.

        ON ADAM - TIGHT - a somber look comes across his face.

                                ADAM
                  I'm afraid not, honey.

        Barbara looks up at him, questioningly.

                                BARBARA
                  Why?  What's wrong?  Adam?

        She stands and joins him at the window.


        THEIR POV THROUGH THE WINDOW

        In the distance we see an automobile funeral procession
        threading its way toward the nearby cemetery.  Head-
        lights are on.  We recognize Jane's car in the line.


        REVERSE ON BARBARA AND ADAM

        somber faces.


        TIGHTER ON PROCESSION

        It arrives at the gravesite.  We see some familiar
        faces, Ernie, and Old Bill the Barber.  Jane and little
        Jane watch as two identical coffins are carried to-
        gether, to two open graves.


        ON BARBARA AND ADAM

        She drops her head sadly on his shoulder.  He leans his
        face slightly into hers.

                                                   FADE OUT.


        FADE IN:

        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        Adam is setting up a small monument in the model town
        cemetery.  It reads:  ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND/UNITED
        IN LIFE/UNDIVIDED IN DEATH.

                                ADAM
                  I wish I had a better view of the
                  cemetery from up here.  I don't
                  know which area is the best
                  placement for us.

        Barbara, trying to clean, lets out a frustrated YELP!
        She paces.

                                ADAM
                         (continuing)
                  Cabin fever, han?

                                BARBARA
                  I can't clean anything.  The
                  vacuum is out in the garage.  I
                  can't leave the house.  Why don't
                  they tell us something?  Where are
                  all the other dead people in the
                  world?  Why is it just you and me?

                                ADAM
                  Maybe this is heaven.

                                BARBARA
                         (looking at the
                          dusty walls)
                  In heaven there wouldn't be dust
                  on the wallpaper.

                                ADAM
                  Hon... I didn't want to die, but
                  really, this is fine with me.
                  Look, we never have to wash dishes
                  again.

                                BARBARA
                  Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three
                  weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you.  I
                  really need to be around <u>people</u>,
                  get out to the church and go
                  grocery shopping.

                                ADAM
                  But I'm not hungry, are you?

        Barbara shakes her head and picks up the Handbook and
        pages through it desperately.

                                BARBARA
                  I keep having this feeling that
                  something has got to happen.

        CAR DOOR SLAMS outside.  Adam and Barbara look at one
        another.  Run to window.


        EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

        Jane Butterfield is staring up at the old house.


        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        Adam, from his angle, can just barely see her.

                                ADAM
                  God, it's Jane.

                                BARBARA
                  What's she doing here?

                                ADAM
                  I don't know.
                         (shouting)
                  <u>Jane, Jane, up here</u>!


        EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

        Unhearing, Jane heads for car.  SOUND OF WIND UP.
        Blows her dress.  Little Jane straggles along with her
        like an apprentice.


        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        Barbara watches Adam, and shakes her head.  He stops.

                                BARBARA
                  She can't see you, right?

        Adam nods.

                                BARBARA
                         (continuing)
                  In the book, Rule Number Two:  the
                  living usually won't see the dead.

                                ADAM
                  Won't?  Or can't?

                                BARBARA
                  Just says "won't."  Wait a minute.
                  Here it says "the living are
                  arrogant... they think they'll
                  never die, so they refuse to see
                  the dead."

                                ADAM
                  Arrogant.  That's Jane all right...

        Barbara sighs and nods.

                                BARBARA
                  At least we won't have to worry
                  about her.

        Adam smiles and goes to his model.


        EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

        Jane drives away.  CAMERA HINGES to see a FOR SALE
        sign.  Across it -- another smaller banner.  It reads:
        SOLD!

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

        The Maitlands are asleep.  CAMERA EXPLORES the room a
        bit.  It is getting slightly tatty.  Adam rolls over,
        pulling the covers off Barbara.  We see:

        ON BARBARA -- she is hovering off the side of the bed.

        An OMINOUS RUMBLE -- like a 4.0 earthquake shakes
        the house.  GLASS RATTLES, the ceramic horses on the
        mantelpiece jump around.  Barbara falls to the floor.
        They look at one another with horror.  They leap up and
        run downstairs.


        INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

        The RUMBLE BUILDS TO A CLIMAX, there is a LOUD METALLIC
        SQUEAL, and then a CRASH... just as Barbara and Adam
        arrive.


        THE FRONT DOOR

        smashes open revealing a moving van ramp.


        A TEN-FOOT ELECTRIC-BLUE ITALIAN LEATHER COUCH

        slides smoothly down the ramp.  On the couch sits DELIA
        DEETZ.

        The couch CRASHES into the base of the staircase,
        smashing the newel post and several of the balusters.
        Barbara cringes.  One of the balusters falls at Delia's
        side.  She grasps it like a scepter.

        Two MOVING MEN rush down the ramp.

                                MOVING MAN #1
                  Sorry about that, Mrs. Deetz.

                                DELIA
                  Don't worry.  It was going anyway.

        Delia is relentlessly New York, relentlessly fashion-
        able, relentlessly thin -- totally self assured.

        She is also a woman with a mission -- to gut Barbara
        and Adam's house and remake it in her own very upscale
        image.

        Delia's gaze is on the living room, but she looks 
        through Adam and Barbara as if they weren't even there
        (which to her eyes they're not).

        Still holding the baluster, Delia gets up off the couch
        and moves into the living room, surveying it with an
        odd mixture of ambition, and resolution.


        BEHIND HER

        the two Moving Men bring in a matching blue leather
        armchair.  In the armchair sits LYDIA DEETZ.

        Lydia, age 14, is a pretty girl, but wan, pale and
        overly-dramatic, dressed as she is in her favorite
        color, black.  She's a combination of a little death
        rocker and an 80's version of Edward Gorey's little
        girls.

        She has a couple of expensive cameras around her neck
        -- and is already taking photographs of the moving
        men.  Lydia is cool, Lydia is sullen, Lydia is her
        father's daughter by his first marriage.  Lydia is
        usually about half-pissed off.  But underneath... we
        like her a lot.

        The Moving Men still hold up the chair, waiting for
        Delia to decide where she wants it.

                                DELIA
                         (continuing)
                  Jesus.  Who lived here?  The
                  Waltons?

        TIGHT ON Lydia -- calmly surveys the house.

        Delia signals wearily that the Moving Men can put the
        chair down anywhere.

                                DELIA
                         (continuing)
                  Get all this other crap out of
                  here.

        Lydia hops down out of the chair, and comes farther
        into the living room.

                                DELIA
                         (continuing)
                  Where is your father?... probably
                  in the kitchen.

        That's the cue for CHARLES DEETZ, who comes in through
        the swinging door, and across the dining room... a ner-
        vous but basically pleasant man, CHARLES DEETZ is
        intent on attacking rest and relaxation with the same
        vengeance that earned him millions in real estate.

                                CHARLES
                  The <u>noise</u> in that kitchen.  Noisy
                  refrigerator, noisy faucets...
                  We'll have to replace it all.  I
                  want no humming in the house.


        LYDIA

        exploring on her own, gazes around the living room with
        growing pleasure, she backs up for a good angle to
        photograph.

        CAMERA HINGES -- She is standing with her back right up
        to Barbara -- who is horrified at this creature.

        Charles enters.

                                CHARLES
                         (to Lydia)
                  What do you think, honey?

                                LYDIA
                  Delia hates it.

        Lydia gazes at a dusty maze of spider webs.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  I could live here.

        A movement makes Lydia turn around and <u>scream</u>.  It is
        Delia.  Not Barbara.

                                DELIA
                  Settle down, Lydia.  I wonder
                  <u>where</u> we are going to get
                  counseling for you out here.

        A VIOLENT FALSETTO SCREAM turns the Deetz family's
        attention to the front windows.

                                OTHO (O.S.)
                  <u>Help</u>!  Oh help!


        OTHO'S MASSIVE BODY

        Wedged in the window frame.  The short, stubby legs,
        dressed in the world's largest pair of Georgia Armani
        slacks, protrude into the living room, waving fran-
        tically.  Expensive Italian loafers are kicked off the
        feet, revealing a pair of expensive patterned socks.
        By their feet shall ye know them.

                                DELIA
                  It's Otho!

                                CHARLES
                  Otho, why didn't you just come in
                  the door?

        Otho's voice comes as if from a great distance.

                                OTHO (O.S.)
                  It's bad luck.  And I believe
                  hugely in luck.

                                DELIA
                  Hold your breath and we'll pull.

        Delia turns to Charles and Lydia for help -- doesn't
        get it -- and at last pulls Otho into the living room
        single-handedly.

        All this while the Moving Men are variously carting out
        the handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous
        new furniture.

        Otho is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and
        faggoty.  But he's not all fat and fun -- this customer
        carries nasty emotional weight as well.


        OTHO

        holds onto the curtains for support as he is pulled
        through the window.  And when he is at last all the way
        through, and upright on his feet, he suddenly gives a
        tremendous yank.  The whole drapery apparatus,
        including valences, crashes to the floor.

                                OTHO
                  That was the single most
                  unattractive window treatment I
                  have ever seen in the entire of my
                  existence.

                                DELIA
                         (starry eyed)
                  I'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the
                  city to consult me, Otho.

        Otho is looking around the room with an eye of quiet
        horror.

                                OTHO
                  Yes, of course you are.  Well,
                  Otho had an intuition.  Call it a
                  hunch -- that it was going to be a
                  fabled monstrosity of a house.
                  And it certainly is.  Charles,
                  you're lucky the yuppies are
                  buying condos, so you can afford
                  what I'm going to have to do to
                  this place.  We are talking <u>from</u>
                  <u>the ground ups'ville</u>!

                                CHARLES
                  That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me
                  out of it.  I am here to relax and
                  clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I
                  mean to do it.

        He exits to find solace in a quiet corner of his house.
        During this speech, Otho has been surreptitiously pos-
        ing for Lydia's camera.  She clicks the shutter.

                                OTHO
                         (ignoring her)
                  Is the rest of the house as bad as
                  this?

                                DELIA
                  The rest of the house is probably
                  worse.  When can you and I get
                  started?

                                OTHO
                  No time like the present, as my
                  wicked stepmother used to say.

        Out of the pockets of his size 56 Georgia Armani
        jacket, Otho takes two cans of spray paint -- the kind
        the graffiti artists use -- and shakes them as if they
        were castanets.  They certainly sound like it.

                                OTHO
                  Delia, let's get this show on the
                  road.


        INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

        At one end, near the stairs leading up to the attic,
        Barbara and Adam are slumped against opposite walls.

                                BARBARA
                  Adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  I hate
                  these people.

                                ADAM
                  They make Jane look good.

                                BARBARA
                  Is this a punishment for something
                  we did in life?  What can we do?

                                ADAM
                         (determined)
                  We're not completely helpless.
                  I've been reading the book.
                  There's a word for people in our
                  predicament, honey.

        Barbara looks at him.

                                BARBARA
                         (continuing)
                  <u>Ghosts</u>!

        Barbara is shocked at the reality.

        Otho and Delia come up the stairs at the end of the
        hallway.

                                OTHO
                  We're dealing with negative
                  entertainment potential here.  I
                  mean, there's absolutely no organic
                  walking flow-through.

        Otho looks down the hallway.  It's empty.  Adam and
        Barbara are no longer there.

                                DELIA
                  What's wrong?

                                OTHO
                  I thought I saw something.

        DeLia turns and spray-paints on the wall -- in luminous
        orange -- the word MAUVE.

                                DELIA
                  Okay?

                                OTHO
                         (screaming with delight)
                  You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients
                  who can read my mind.  I don't
                  think people realize how strong a
                  connection there is between
                  interior design and the
                  supernatural.

                                DELIA
                         (fawning)
                  <u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u>
                  <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.

                                OTHO
                  Gooood!

        Delia opens the door and they step inside another room.

                                DELIA
                  This will be Lydia's room.


        INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - DAY

        It's not Lydia's room yet, of course, because it still
        has the Maitlands' furniture in it.  Barbara had partly
        wallpapered it before the accident.  Her tools are still
        there.

                                DELIA
                  What do you think?

                                OTHO
                  Viridian?

                                DELIA
                  Viridian?  What is...?

        Otho spray-paints the word VIRIDIAN on the wall -- plus
        the word BLUE GREEN -- and Cr2 03, right over a picture
        of Adam and Barbara as kids.

                                OTHO
                  Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic
                  oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in
                  chemistry.  I was a hair analyst!
                  Briefly.  Interior design is a
                  <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as
                  Doctor Otho.
                         (looking at wall)
                  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!

                                DELIA
                  Of course, her favorite color!
                  How <u>beautiful</u>!

        Delia smiles.  Behind Delia and Otho, the room's closet
        door swings slowly open with and ominous CREAK.


        DELIA AND OTHO

        turn that way, with a suggestion of dread.  Inside the
        closet, Barbara's corpse is suspended from the ceiling
        by a belt.  The corpse twists with a CREAK, and Barbara
        grins ghostly -- and slowly tears off her face, leaving
        nothing but muscle and bone beneath.  Her eyeballs
        dangle on her cheeks.

        Delia and Otho stare aghast.

                                DELIA
                  <u>Oh my God</u>!

                                OTHO
                  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the
                  other closets are bigger than this
                  one.

        He walks over.  Looks inside.

                                OTHO
                         (continuing)
                  Were these people dwarfes? (sic)
                         (spies something)
                  Oooooo!...  Look!

        He finds, neatly hung in plastic, the Maitlands'
        wedding outfits.  Totally captivated by this powerful
        image, he peers through the plastic at them.  Holding
        each up to Delia.  Barbara watches wide-eyed at them.

                                OTHO
                         (continuing)
                  Ozzie...
                         (holding up
                          her dress)
                  ... and... Harriet!  What <u>happened</u>
                  to these people?

        Delia <u>slams</u> the door in Barbara's contorted face.

                                DELIA
                  They died.


        INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

        Delia and Otho come out of Lydia's bedroom and go
        through the bathroom.  Disgusted, they continue on to
        the study.


        OTHO

        reaches out and turns the knob.  The door swings omi-
        nously open on Charles' study.  This had been Adam's
        reading and birdwatching study.  Bird posters on the
        wall, books everywhere.  Straight out of <u>Better Homes</u>
        <u>and Gardens</u> 1963.

                                OTHO
                  Ooo.  Deliver me from L.L. Bean!


        ANGLE

        There is one slight difference, however, because on the
        rag rug in the middle of the floor lies Adam's headless
        corpse.  Standing over him, holding in one hand a long
        knife and in the other Adam's blood-and-gore dripping
        head is Barbara -- with a maniacal look on her face.
        Behind them, Charles is thumbing through Adam's Audubon
        collection.  He sits up like a cornered animal protect-
        ing his territory.

                                CHARLES
                         (to Otho and Delia)
                  This room is <u>off limits</u>.  I don't
                  want either of you to touch one
                  piece of furniture in here.  This
                  is <u>my</u> room.


        INSIDE THE ROOM

        The eyes of Adam's severed head open and look up at
        Barbara -- <u>she stops screaming</u>.

                                ADAM'S HEAD
                  They don't see us.  They can't
                  hear us.

        Outside, Delia is shaking her head.

                                DELIA
                  The woman who lived here had the
                  aesthetic instincts of Betty
                  Crocker.

                                BARBARA
                  I'm going to get her.

                                DELIA
                  I cannot convey to you the extent
                  to which this house <u>bores</u> me.

                                OTHO
                         (looking around
                          scientifically)
                  Once you cover up the wallpaper,
                  knock down a few walls, alter the
                  traffic patterns, and -- perhaps
                  -- think about an inground pool --
                  the place <u>might</u> just be livable.
                  What's on the third floor?

                                DELIA
                  Attic space.

                                OTHO
                  Let's see.  We could turn that
                  into a media room.

        They head up the stars to the attic.


        INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

        Adam's head has a look of terror on it.

                                ADAM'S HEAD
                  Oh, God.  I forgot to lock the
                  attic door!

        Adam's headless body jumps up off the floor and rushes
        out of the room.


        INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - SAME TIME

        Otho and Delia climbing.  The headless corpse careens
        past them, around the bend in the stairs and out of
        sight.

                                OTHO
                  Did you feel something?

        Delia shakes her head.

                                OTHO
                         (continuing)
                  I felt a cool wind.

        The expression on Otho's face suggests he knows more
        than he's telling.


        INT. LANDING OUTSIDE ATTIC DOOR - SAME TIME

        The headless corpse rushes through the open door into
        the attic.


        INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

        The headless corpse <u>slams</u> the door shut, turns the key
        in the lock.  Then he slumps against the locked door in
        an exaggerated stance of relief.


        INT. ATTIC LANDING - SAME TIME

        Delia tries the knob.  The door is locked.

                                OTHO
                  You don't have a key?

                                DELIA
                  Maybe Charles does.

                                OTHO
                  I have a feeling there's some very
                  interesting space behind this
                  door.

                                DELIA
                         (sarcastic)
                  Probably the world's largest
                  <u>Reader's Digest</u> collection!
                  C'mon, let's have some chablis,
                  Otho, I'm laid bare by this
                  experience.  Entirely bare.


        INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

        Barbara still holding Adam's head.

        Charles still calmly leafing through the Audubons.

                                ADAM'S HEAD
                  Whew!  That was close.

                                BARBARA
                  I cannot witness this.

        Barbara distractedly puts Adam's head on a bookshelf.
        His headless body fumbles with the books and finally
        reattaches the head.


        INT. STUDY - DAY

        Adam turns away from the window.

        Barbara, fuming, moves around Charles making wild
        gestures.

                                BARBARA
                  What's the good of being a ghost
                  if you can't frighten people to
                  death?

                                ADAM
                  Oh, honey...

                                BARBARA
                  No, I'm not putting up with this.

        She storms out of the room.


        INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

        Barbara storms in, as if straight from the room up-
        stairs.  She heads straight for the back door.  Just as
        she opens the door, Adam rushes up.

                                ADAM
                  Barbara, honey!  Don't go out
                  there.  You don't know --

                                BARBARA
                  Nothing can be worse than this...

        She flings open the door and steps outside.  She
        promptly disappears.

                                ADAM
                  Barbara!


        EXT. SURFACE OF SATURN'S MOON TITAN - DAY

        Barbara plunges into the dusty surface of Titan with an
        enormous Saturn looming in the sky.  She looks around
        with wonder and some fear.


        A SULFUR VOLCANO

        erupts in the distance.  A meteor CRASHES with a lurid
        EXPLOSION.  As from a great distance she hears Adam's
        VOICE.  Like THUNDER.

                                ADAM
                  Barbara!

        She turns slowly in the yellow dense sand that covers
        the surface of this distant moon.


        BARBARA'S POV

        Adam is trudging towards her.  Behind him, hovering
        isolated in the air, is the kitchen door.


        BACK TO SCENE

        Adam at last catches up with her.  Surveys around them.

                                BARBARA
                  Oh Adam.  <u>Find</u> somebody.  I'm
                  getting all yellow.  <u>Do</u> something!


        BEHIND THEM

        Something is burrowing rapidly toward them through the
        sand.  The Something could be right out of "Dune".


        BARBARA AND ADAM

        stare for a moment, then Adam grabs her and pulls her
        toward the kitchen door.  But the kitchen door has
        moved, so they veer in the new direction.

        The Something follows them and <u>rises out of the sand</u>.


        ON SOMETHING

        It is a very big, very nasty, and very hungry SNAPPING
        SANDWORM.  It ROARS and lunges at them.


        BARBARA

        slightly angered at it, instinctively bats at it.


        THE SANDWORM

        is momentarily stunned at Barbara's audacity.  It
        freezes and shakes its loathesome head.


        BARBARA

        bats at it again.  Adam is wide-eyed, tries to pull her
        away.  The Sandworm recovers and ROARS after them.


        ADAM

        grabs Barbara and tries to escape, but they slip and
        sink in the sand.

        They make it to the door just in time, swing it open
        and hurl themselves through.  The door shuts with a
        BANG just in front of the ROARING SANDWORM.

        THE SANDWORM

        rears and ROARS in frustration, HOWLING to the ringed
        planet.


        INT. KITCHEN

        Barbara, weeping, throws herself in Adam's arms.

                                BARBARA
                  Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me
                  alone.

                                ADAM
                  <u>You</u> left me.

                                BARBARA
                  I know.  I'm sorry.

        She hugs him tight.

                                BARBARA
                         (continuing)
                  I just realized that I could have
                  been killed alone.  Don't ever
                  leave me, honey.

        Both contemplate that horror.

                                BARBARA
                         (continuing)
                  We're trapped in this house
                  forever... with those... people.

                                ADAM
                  You can't say that for sure.  It
                  could be a transitional thing.
                  Like a post-life crisis.  We just
                  have to be tougher with them.
                  Come on.  Have some brandy.
                  Spirits?

                                BARBARA
                         (a tentative smile)
                  Death didn't improve your sense of
                  humor.

        They head for the dining room.


        INT. DINING ROOM

        Adam has his arms around Barbara's shoulder.  They walk
        in the door and stumble upon the Deetzes at their
        dinner.  Lydia's back is to them.  Barbara and Adam
        back out of the room but stop to listen.


        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        The Deetz's around the dining room table.  There are
        candles and good china laid out-- but they're eating
        out of Chinese take-out boxes.

                                DELIA
                  I can't believe that we're eating
                  Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan
                  up here?  Hunan?

                                CHARLES
                  There's only one Chinese
                  restaurant out here, darling, the
                  owners are Irish and Irish people
                  happen to cook Cantonese.  They
                  don't know better.

                                LYDIA
                  I plan to have a stroke from the
                  amount of MSG that's in this food.

                                DELIA
                  This is our first meal in this
                  house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do
                  our little private parts to make
                  it a pleasant one?

                                CHARLES
                  Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a
                  darkroom in the basement.

                                LYDIA
                         (dramatically)
                  My whole life is a darkroom!
                  One... big... dark... room.

        Delia rolls her eyes and nods.  She's been through this
        before.

                                DELIA
                  Nonsense... you'll go to school,
                  maybe meet a farm boy.

        Delia laughs.  Charles smiles.

                                LYDIA
                         (doleful)
                  Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll
                  let me hang myself from a rope in
                  his barn.

                                CHARLES
                  Lydia, in a couple of years this
                  whole town will be <u>filled</u> with
                  people like us.

                                DELIA
                  We'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer
                  New York.  I'll start sculpting
                  again... I'll teach those gallery
                  bastards to refuse my sculpture.
                  And when Otho and I get through
                  with this house, you people are
                  not going to recognize it.

                                LYDIA
                         (dramatically)
                  I say let's keep it the way it is.

        Delia stares at Lydia.

                                CHARLES
                         (smiles)
                  Good idea!

        Delia shifts her glare to Charles.

                                LYDIA
                  I do.  I really like it.  I
                  mean, it's already sort of like
                  somebody's home, isn't it?  Their
                  couch is comfortable and doesn't
                  stick to your legs.  It smells
                  like a real home, not a French
                  whorehouse.

                                DELIA
                  Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u>
                  <u>young</u>.
                         (back to business)
                  Charles, we need to call that
                  awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow
                  and get the key to the attic door.
                  Can't you find a way to hold back
                  some of her commission?

                                CHARLES
                  We're going to have a lot to do
                  tomorrow...
                  The Goodwill truck is coming.

                                DELIA
                  ... and whatever is up there in
                  that attic goes away with it.

                                CHARLES
                  Should have it fumigated, too.  I
                  saw a fly today.

        Lydia looks at them with a mixture of sadness and
        anger.


        OUTSIDE THE DOOR - ON THE STAIRS

        -- listening, sit Barbara and Adam.  A tear rolls down
        her face.


        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        Adam and Barbara are lying down on the floor, peering
        out of one of the small windows overlooking the front
        yard of the house.  The handbook open in front of them.


        EXT. FRONT YARD - ADAM AND BARBARA'S POV - DAY

        The entire front yard is alive with workmen and their
        vehicles.  Plumbers, electricians, cable TV men, etc.
        In the road on front of the house are several cars of
        rubbernecking locals, astonished by all the activity.
        The City has come to Town.  Moving men continue to move
        in the Deetz' modern, expensive and ugly furniture.
        They collide with Goodwill men coming out with the
        Maitlands' lovely antiques and personal possessions.


        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        Adam and Barbara just look at one another as if to say
        "We're next!"  Adam leafs through the handbook furi-
        ously.

                                BARBARA
                  Look in the index...

                                ADAM
                  Not really...  what's this?

        Adam pulls from the book an ancient, yellowed,
        crumbling handbill.  He carefully opens it.

        ON handbill -- very primitive, crude, red printing.

                                ADAM (V.O.)
                         (reading)
                  Having difficulty adjusting?
                  Is death a problem and not a
                  solution?  Unhappy with eternity?
                  Troubled by the living?  Call
                  Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist.
                  That's Betelgeuse,  Betel...

        The remainder of the sheet is torn off.

        ON Barbara -- fingering the torn edge.  Looking in the
        book for the remainder.  No luck.

                                BARBARA
                  That's it?  No number, or
                  instructions?

                                ADAM
                  Nothing.  The bio-exorcist?  I
                  don't get it...


        INT. KITCHEN

        Charles, away from the chaos outside is calmly steeping
        a mug of herb tea.  His solitude is interrupted by a
        2500 lb. Vulcan range breaking through a too-small
        kitchen window.

                                CHARLES
                         (shouting through
                          the window)
                  What the hell are you trying to do
                  out there?


        DELIA - OUTSIDE

        is berating the inept crane operator and shrieks
        periodically at some fine art movers who are struggling
        under her horrid modern welded steel sculptures.


        LYDIA

        snaps photos of the mayhem.  She stops to scan the whole
        house.


        LYDIA'S POV

        When her gaze reaches to top of the house, she suddenly
        glimpses Barbara and Adam's faces in the window.


        BACK TO SCENE

        Lydia blinks hard.  Her mouth drops open.  She looks
        all around -- as if she'd just seen a ghost or two.


        JANE BUTTERFIELD'S CAR

        pulls up.  Little Jane sits in the front seat, burdened
        with an enormous stack of collated and stapled copies.

        Lydia catches sight of Jane and runs over.

        Little Jane locks her door, in fear of Lydia-the
        strange.  Lydia stares at her.

                                LITTLE JANE
                  Are you a boy or a girl?

                                LYDIA
                  I only speak to vertebrates.

                                LYDIA
                  What happened to the people who
                  used to live here?

                                LITTLE JANE
                         (ratty little voice)
                  They drowned!

                                JANE
                  Yes, they were family.  I was
                  devastated.
                         (beat)
                  Here, darling.

        Jane hands a key to Lydia.

                                LYDIA
                         (impressed)
                  Is this the key to the attic?

                                JANE
                  That's a skeleton key.  It'll open
                  any door in that house.  Will you
                  give it to your father?
                         (handing her a
                          business card)
                  And you might mention that I
                  single-handedly decorated the
                  house.  In case he needs advice in
                  that area.  Come see me.

        Jane goes away.


        ANOTHER ANGLE

        Lydia's face sobers as she looks up at the now empty
        attic window.

                                DELIA (O.S.)
                  Help!  Get off me!

        Lydia drops the skeleton key into her pocket surrepti-
        tiously.  She follows Delia's SHRIEKING.


        EXT. HOUSE - DAY

        Lydia rounds the corner to see Delia, pinned flat
        against the house by one of her horrid steel sculp-
        tures.  Two movers are struggling to free her.  Lydia
        snaps a quick photograph.

        They finally free Delia.  She clutches at her head,
        just short of tearing her hair out.

                                DELIA
                  <u>You jerks</u>!  That is my art, and it
                  is <u>dangerous</u>!  You think I want to
                  want to die like that?
                         (seeing Lydia)
                  Lydia.  Moving is a family affair.
                  So buckle down now and go get
                  Mommy some drugs.

                                LYDIA
                  Any particular kind?

                                DELIA
                  Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!

        Lydia walks off toward the house.


        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        Barbara is half-hiding on the edge of the window.

                                BARBARA
                  That little girl saw us.

                                ADAM
                  She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u>
                  them see us.

                                BARBARA
                  But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.

                                ADAM
                         (pause, thinking
                          that over)
                  That's all we need.


        INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

        Lydia looks up the stairs at the attic landing.  She's
        a little scared.  She decides to go up the dark stairs.

        IN THE HALL

        At the end of the hall stands Charles, directing men
        who are carrying books into the room that will be his
        study.

        He continues on.


        A BLAST of STEAM

        fills the hallway, because workmen are already going at
        the wallpaper.  Lydia emerges from it.  Looking up at
        stairway to attic, mounting courage.


        INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - DAY

        Lydia creeps upward, taking the skeleton key from her
        pocket.  FLOORBOARDS SQUEAK.


        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        Adam works on his model.  He hears the SQUEAK, looks up
        confidently.

                                ADAM
                         (whispering)
                  Don't worry.  I've locked it.

        Barbara smiles and knits while rocking in her chair.


        INT. ATTIC LANDING

        Lydia quietly inserts the key in the lock of the attic
        door.  She turns it.  The key is stiff.  She turns
        harder.  It's stuck.  Lydia tries the door -- it's no
        go.  She turns the key again.  This time it goes all
        the way around.


        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        Barbara and Adam, surprised by the key, look at each
        other, carefully, very quietly, stand up and tiptoe
        toward door.


        ON THE SCREEN OF AN OLD TV SET

        in the corner of the attic -- <u>Suddenly</u> -- a ghostly
        image POPS ON.


        ON TV - A BIZARRE, SMALLISH FELLOW

        outfitted in a too-big cowboy hat, bad wig, and over-
        sized sunglasses appears on screen <u>singing</u> very
        quickly.  (It's a heavily disguised BETELGEUSE.)


        BEHIND HIM

        the CAMERA QUICKLY PANS an assortment of tombstones a
        la Cal Worthington.

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (singing)
                  Have the living got you down?
                  <u>Betelgeuse</u>!
                  Are they jacking you around?
                  <u>Betelgeuse</u>!
                  Have you broken out in hives
                  'Cause you're tired of their jive?
                  I will drive them from your
                  hive... <u>Betelgeuse</u>!


        ANOTHER ANGLE

        CAMERA TILTS DOWN a flashing tombstone with
        "BETELGEUSE" written on it.  Adam rushes over to shut
        it off.  He can't find a plug.  He looks around behind
        set... no workings inside at all.  He peers around to
        the screen.  It is blank.  <u>Suddenly</u> -- Betelgeuse POPS
        ON AGAIN.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Say it once... Betelgeuse
                  Say it twice... Betelgeuse.
                  The third time's a charm...
                  Betelgeuse!
                  Come on <u>down</u>!

        He POPS OFF.  Adam and Barbara stare at each other.


        INT. LANDING - DAY

        Lydia listens.  Did she hear something?  She puts her
        hand on the knob and tries to turn it.  It's stuck.

        Then the key eerily pops out of the lock and falls on
        the floor.

        Charles' head suddenly appears behind her.  Scares her.

                                CHARLES
                  What are you doing?


        INT. ATTIC

        Adam is holding on tight to the knob of the door.  With
        her knitting needle, Barbara has poked the key out.

        The two stand absolutely still, listening, terrified of
        the living intruders.


        INT. ATTIC LANDING - LYDIA AND CHARLES

                                LYDIA
                  I was just trying to open the
                  door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought
                  over a skeleton key.

                                CHARLES
                  Let me have it.


        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        Barbara and Adam tighten.


        ON THE LANDING

                                LYDIA
                  But it doesn't work.

        She hands her father the key.  He looks at it and
        throws it in the corner.

                                CHARLES
                  Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway,
                  this can wait.  We'll get a
                  crowbar later.  Where's your
                  mother?

                                LYDIA
                         (very quick de-
                          cisive delivery)
                  Stepmother.

                                CHARLES
                  I'm going down to relax.  I want a
                  noise-free zone.  Do you
                  understand?  Noise-free.

        He goes down the stairs.

                                LYDIA
                  Dad?

        He continues.

                                CHARLES
                         (irritated, over
                          his shoulder)
                  What?

                                LYDIA
                  I'm lonely.

        A BLAST OF STEAM from below drowns out her words.
        Charles stops and turns around.  The BLAST STOPS.

                                CHARLES
                  What?


        TIGHT ON LYDIA

        She is resolved.

                                LYDIA
                  Nothing.

        Charles continues.  She begins to follow slowly.


        ON KEY

        behind Lydia.  WIDEN as Adam rushes out the door, grabs
        the key and rushes back in again.  Lydia hears some-
        thing but doesn't see.


        INT. ATTIC

        Barbara and Adam have moved away from the door.

                                ADAM
                         (looking through
                          the handbook)
                  We need some help.  I found
                  something this morning.  Here.
                  Emergencies.
                         (reads)
                  "In case of emergency, draw door."

                                BARBARA
                  Draw door?  I don't know why we
                  keep looking in that stupid book.

        Adam takes a piece of chalk and draws a little door on
        the exposed brick of the chimney.

                                BARBARA
                         (continuing)
                  You don't actually think this
                  is going to work?

        Adam draws a doorknob.  Then he tries to turn it.  The
        door, perhaps to his surprise, fails to open.

                                BARBARA
                  Yet another triumph for Adam and
                  Barbara in the afterlife.  Why
                  don't we try this Beetle guy??...

                                ADAM
                  Wait.

        He looks at book, then writes on the door:  KNOCK AND
        ENTER.  He exchanges a glance with Barbara.  She's even
        more skeptical than before.  Turns away in disgust.

        Adam knocks on the door, and turns the knob.  Nothing.
        She is more disgusted.  Adam goes back to the book.

                                ADAM
                         (continuing)
                  <u>Aha</u>!  Knock <u>three</u> times.


        ANOTHER ANGLE

        He knocks three times.  Turns knob.  The chalked door
        swings magnificently open.

        Behind is an eerie light source, SOARING MUSIC, maybe
        even a heavenly choir singing pear-shaped syllables.

        Barbara and Adam look at one another again.  They hold
        hands and step tentatively through.

        Their figures are lost in the blinding light.

        They start to shut door after them.


        ON THE ATTIC LANDING

        Lydia is staring at the light pouring from under the
        attic door.  It suddenly goes out.

        ON LYDIA

        She is dumbfounded.  She listens.


        ON THE LANDING

        Lydia <u>speeds</u> down the steps.


        INT. CHARLES' STUDY - DAY

        Charles, fiercely intent on relaxing, paces like a
        catfish out of water.  Ralph Lauren in K-mart.  He
        stretches.  He sits uneasily in an easy chair, tries
        like hell to get comfortable.  Finally, he puts a book
        under his bottom to get sitting straight.  Looks around
        tapping his fingers.  What to do?  Looks at watch.

        He takes down a book from Adam's library, it is an
        Audubon book of birds.  He whips through it like it's
        the comics and then looks around for more.

        He finds the "Illustrated Walden" by Thoreau.  He
        speed reads it.

        He is now really bored.  Goes to the fireplace, tries
        to light it.  Cannot do it.  Goes to desk and writes:

                                OTHO-INSTALL GAS FIRE LOGS IN
                                STUDY.

        He studies bird posters.  Finds beautiful cardinal
        picture.

        Takes field glasses and looks out window.


        HIS POV

        Spies big ugly-looking ratty bird devouring something.


        ON CHARLES

        horrified.  Wrinkles his nose.

        Lydia enters.  He jumps.

                                CHARLES
                  Jesus Christ!

        Lydia is shocked.

                                CHARLES
                         (continuing)
                  Darling, can't you see I'm
                  relaxing in here!

                                LYDIA
                  Well I just wanted to tell you
                  what I saw.

                                CHARLES
                  Lydia.  What the hell is the point
                  of my moving up here if you people
                  won't let me relax?  Go help your
                  mother.

        Charles returns to field glasses, spies something.  She
        looks at him in frustration.

                                LYDIA
                         (on her way out)
                  Fine.  Maybe you can relax in a
                  haunted house.  But I can't.

        She exits.  Charles peers after her, brow furrowed.
        Looks out again at the village.  Uses his field glasses
        to get a better look.


        HIS POV

        It is the Bozman Building.  Ernie is out front pol-
        ishing the brass lion.


        ON CHARLES

        He thinks.  Moves the field glasses to punctuate his
        discovery of the building.  (His eyes never leave field
        glasses throughout the following.)

                                CHARLES
                  Nice building... Bad paint.  Good
                  lines... bad roof.  Good
                  parking... hmmm???

        That really registers with him.  Without looking, he
        dials a familiar number on the phone with one hand,
        lifts the receiver.  He clacks his teeth together pur-
        posefully.

                                SECRETARY'S VOICE
                  Botco International.

                                CHARLES
                  Yes, I'd like to speak with Maxie
                  Dean.

                                SECRETARY'S VOICE
                  He's not in right now.

                                CHARLES
                  Well tell him that Charles Deetz
                  called.

        He hangs up and continues to spy on Bozman Building.
        Clacks his teeth.

                                CHARLES
                         (continuing)
                  My God what I could do with that
                  parking.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


        TIGHT SHOT - BARBARA AND ADAM

        Very still, they look cautiously to the right and left
        -- just with their eyes.  They're astounded by what
        they see, though we don't yet see it.

                                ADAM
                  ... Not what I expected when we
                  walked through that door.

                                BARBARA
                  No. But it's somewhere without big
                  worms.

        CAMERA DRAWS BACK and we find that Adam and Barbara are
        in:


        INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

        The most unpleasant waiting room that you ever remember
        waiting in.  Fifties furniture with broken legs,
        couches propped up on telephone books.

        Standing ashtrays with dirty stand.  Linoleum floors
        patched a hundred times.  National Geographics with the
        covers torn off.  The "Take a number" registers in the
        millions.


        AS THE CAMERA COMPLETES A CIRCLE OF THE ROOM

        We see a RECEPTIONIST.  She's the quintessential 50's
        receptionist -- tight sweater, bullet-breasted bra,
        bleached hair, red lipstick.  She's wearing a ribbon
        across her breast reading "MISS ARGENTINA" and there
        are knife slashes across both wrists.

                                RECEPTIONIST
                  You don't have an appointment, do
                  you?

                                ADAM
                  W... We didn't know how to make one.

                                BARBARA
                  An appointment for what?

                                RECEPTIONIST
                  What do you want?

                                BARBARA
                  We need some help.

                                RECEPTIONIST
                  Already?  You just bit the big one
                  nine months ago and you want help?

                                ADAM
                  Nine months?  What difference does
                  that make?

                                RECEPTIONIST
                         (shrugging)
                  Good luck.  You're going to use up
                  all your help vouchers.

                                ADAM
                  Help vouchers?

                                RECEPTIONIST
                  D-90's.  You spend a hundred
                  and twenty-five years on earth,
                  actually, in that house, during
                  which you get only three class-one
                  D-90 intercessions with Juno.  You
                  probably haven't even read through
                  the manual completely yet.

                                BARBARA
                  Why three?


        TYPIST

        Behind the Receptionist holds up both hands each of
        which have only three fingers on them.

                                TYPIST
                  Rule Number Three.  Everything
                  comes in threes...

                                RECEPTIONIST
                  You'll have to wait if you don't
                  have an appointment.

                                BARBARA
                  How long do we have to wait?

                                ADAM
                  Wait for who?

                                RECEPTIONIST
                  For Juno, your caseworker.  Not
                  that it matters to your type.  But
                  there <u>are</u> all these other people
                  here ahead of you.  I'd say 3
                  hours.

        The waiting room is now filled with people.  Dead
        people, some in fairly awful states.  A cornucopia of
        carnal shreddage.

        Adam and Barbara look around for a moment, then very
        quietly, they reach out to grasp hands.

                                RECEPTIONIST
                         (continuing)
                  Number 54 million, six hundred
                  one.  Ferndock.

        CAMERA PUSHES IN CLOSE.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


        INT. ATTIC LANDING - DAY

        Lydia kneels down with a screwdriver, a nail file, an
        ice pick, and a credit card.  She inserts nail file
        into the door.  She struggles, and after several
        attempts -- finally uses the ice pick and POP!  The
        door swings open ominously.


        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        Lydia enters.  The room is dim, and filled with dust
        motes.  There are shadows in all the corners.

        She bumps into a switch which engages the model sun and
        moon and that eerily illuminates the model town.  She's
        frightened, then entranced.

        She peers at it from different angles, her fear for-
        gotten.  She notes small tools scattered around an
        unfinished area.  She continues around the model,
        oblivious to everything else.  Then...

        She kicks something.  Ducks under the table and comes
        up with something, holds it up to the light.  It's the
        handbook.  She looks through it.  Finds the marked
        page... looks at the chalk door.


        INT. OFFICE - DAY

        Barbara and Adam are still holding hands, as if they
        hadn't moved.  Like waiting for an IRS audit.

                                BARBARA
                         (to Adam)
                  Is this what happens when you die?

        The Receptionist overhears.  She points at Barbara.

                                RECEPTIONIST
                  This is what happens when <u>YOU</u> die.
                         (points to another
                          corpse)
                  That is what happens when <u>HE</u> dies.
                  That is what happens when <u>THEY</u>
                  die.  It's highly personal.  And
                  I'll tell you something... if I
                  knew then what I know now... I
                  wouldn't have had my little
                  "accident!"

        She holds up her wrists and smiling at her little joke,
        wriggles them indicating her slashes.

                                OTHER CORPSES
                         (all together)
                  <u>Amen</u>!

        Barbara and Adam look at them.  Corpses resume doing
        what they were doing.  A GRINDING NOISE O.S. -- The
        Receptionist looks up.

        Barbara and Adam also look O.S.


        THEIR POV

        A Message delivery wire GRINDS along loudly on a
        pulley.  The actual message is held in the hand of the
        MESSENGER, a flattened corpse, suspended as if on a
        shirt clothesline, tire marks on his face and clothing.
        A major roadkill.  Dust and gravel ground into him.  He
        smiles wanly at Barbara and Adam as the Receptionist
        takes a message on a piece of paper and reads it.

                                RECEPTIONIST
                  Maitland, party of two!  Take your
                  handbook and go to the sixth door.

        Barbara and Adam upset at the loss of their handbook...

                                BARBARA
                  We forgot our handbook.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        Lydia is studying the handbook with intense interest.

                                CHARLES (O.S.)
                         (from distant
                          downstairs)
                  Lydia, Delia needs your help!

        Lydia gives one more look at the book, and then goes to
        the door quickly and silently.

                                CHARLES (O.S.)
                  Right now, Delia says!


        INT. OFFICE - DAY

                                RECEPTIONIST
                         (shaking her head
                          in disgust)
                  Out that way, through the typing
                  pool, down the corridor, sixth
                  door on your left.  Sixth door.
                  Two threes.
                         (shaking her head)
                  Airhead.

        Adam and Barbara walk through a door.


        INT. TYPING POOL - DAY

        A vast room of desks arranged in a grid, straight
        out of "How To Succeed In Business"... Each desk is
        occupied, too, but most of the secretaries are merely
        skeletons, or mouldering corpses slumped over their
        typewriters.

        Only one secretary, somewhere in the vast grid, is
        typing slowly, with long pauses between words.

        The Messenger on his return trip, parallels Barbara and
        Adam as they walk along.  Barbara can't look at him.

                                MESSENGER
                  How do I look?  There're no
                  mirrors on this side.

                                ADAM
                         (trying to be
                          pleasant)
                  Fine, you look fine.

                                MESSENGER
                  Thanks.  I've been feeling a
                  little flat.


        ANOTHER ANGLE

        He laughs at his own joke as he goes back through the
        very, very narrow slot in the wall where the line
        runs.  Adam and Barbara look to the right and left.
        A vast stack of files slips off a desk and spills out
        onto the floor.


        INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

        Barbara and Adam enter corridor.

        Empty, like a hotel corridor, but all the doors are of
        different types -- a revolving door, a dutch door,
        church doors.  They walk past a waist-high window,
        covered by a roll-up shade.

                                BARBARA
                  A hundred twenty-five years!
                  I can't believe it.  I can't
                  believe they didn't <u>tell</u> us.

        She bumps into the shade and it rolls up FLAPPING.  She
        stares in through the window.  Adam peers in it too.


        THEIR POV

        A smouldering, mist-filled room.  From the smoky plasma
        floats an occasional tortured soul.  Unspeakably SAD
        MUSIC wafts from within.  They get only a glimpse of
        the bodies in this horrible human soup.

                                BARBARA
                  Adam, look at this.

        Suddenly, floating up from below, immediately on the
        other side of the window, a white-crepe face emerges.
        It seems to be that of a woman, her eyes are red and
        blue tears rim them.  Her pale skin is covered with a
        flaking crust of salt.  She wears the saddest look
        ever.  Her mouth opens plaintively but no sound comes.

                                BARBARA
                         (continuing)
                  Oh, Adam... what is this?

        A reflection joins them on their side of the window.


        A SINISTER LITTLE JANITOR

        wizened and efficient, pulls the shade down firmly.

                                SINISTER MAN
                  That's the lost souls room.
                  A room for ghosts who have been
                  exorcised.  Poor devils.  That's
                  death for the dead.  It's all in
                  the handbook.  Keep moving.

        The man scuttles off.  Adam and Barbara walk on sadly,
        until they come to a door that looks exactly like the
        swinging door between the kitchen and dining room of
        their house.

                                ADAM
                  This is it... the sixth door.

        Puzzled -- Barbara pushes it.


        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        Everything is dark, quiet -- but the furniture is
        obviously not theirs, and neither is the decoration.
        Adam and Barbara exchange glances, and push on through
        into the living room.


        INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Quiet, dark.  Everyone's asleep.

                                ADAM
                  My God, we're back home.

                                BARBARA
                  Look at this, everything is
                  different down here.  All our
                  furniture is gone.

                                ADAM
                  How long do you suppose we were
                  waiting?

                                JUNO
                  Three months.


        ANOTHER ANGLE

        A spot comes on, revealing JUNO -- their caseworker.
        She's an older woman, no nonsense about her.  Over-
        dressed in an outfit that includes a blouse with
        ruffled cuffs.  We will at some point catch a glimpse
        of her slashed throat -- she smokes heavily.  Occa-
        sionaly smoke puffs from her cut throat.

                                JUNO
                  I'd nearly given up on you.  I was
                  about to leave.  I do have other
                  clients.

                                BARBARA
                  Are you Juno, our caseworker?

                                JUNO
                  Yes.  I evaluate individual cases
                  and determine if help is needed,
                  deserved, and available.

                                BARBARA
                  We need help.  We deserve help.

                                ADAM
                  Are you available?

                                JUNO
                  No.
                         (beat)
                  What's wrong?

                                BARBARA
                  We're very unhappy.

                                JUNO
                  What do you expect?  You're dead.

                                ADAM
                  We'd like some help in getting rid
                  of the people who moved in here.
                  Barbara and I worked very hard on
                  this house.

                                BARBARA
                  We probably wouldn't mind sharing
                  the house with people who were --

                                JUNO
                  -- like you used to be?

                                BARBARA
                  Yes.

                                ADAM
                  But <u>these</u> people --

        He indicates a particularly bad piece of Delia's sculp-
        ture.  Juno walks around it shaking her head.


        INT. HOUSE

        The following conversation takes place as Barbara and
        Adam follow Juno as she looks around the house and ends
        up in their attic space.

                                JUNO
                  Things seem pretty quiet here.
                  You should thank God you didn't
                  die in Italy.
                         (checking the file)
                  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been
                  studying the manual?

                                ADAM
                  We tried.

                                JUNO
                  The Intermediate Interface chapter
                  on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em
                  out yourself.  It's your house.
                  Haunted houses don't come easy.

                                BARBARA
                  We don't quite get it.

        Juno's watch BUZZES, she stops it.

                                JUNO
                  I heard.
                         (refers to her file)
                  Tore your face right off!  Bad
                  news.  It obviously doesn't do
                  any good to pull your heads off in
                  front of people if they can't see
                  you.

                                ADAM
                  We have to start simpler, is that
                  it?

                                JUNO
                  Start simply.  Do what you know.
                  Use your talents.  Practice.  We
                  only help those who help
                  themselves.  Just do a little at a
                  time.  And of course, practice,
                  practice, practice.  It's tricky
                  but -- you weren't murderers by
                  any chance, were you?

                                BARBARA
                  No.

                                JUNO
                  Pity.  Murderers seem to have an
                  easy time of it.  Just look at
                  Amityville.
                         (reminiscing)
                  He was one of my boys.  Didn't
                  have to give that one any lessons.
                  From day one... But I must be
                  off... I've got a plane load of
                  football players crashed in the
                  midwest... they need a lot of
                  help, just with the basics.

        Points at her head indicating dumbness.

                                BARBARA
                  If... we have trouble.  What about
                  the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...

                                JUNO
                         (quickly interrupt-
                          ing her)
                  Don't say his name, you <u>don't</u> want
                  his help.

        Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Puzzled.

                                ADAM &amp; BARBARA
                  Well... We might...


        INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

        Juno peers into the model cemetery with interest.  A
        FLY BUZZES around her.  Juno blows it away.  Fly flees.

                                JUNO
                  No you don't!  He does not work
                  well with others.

                                BARBARA
                  What do you mean?  What's he do?

        A grave look comes over Juno's face as the light
        changes to suggest someone telling a ghost story around
        a campfire.

                                JUNO
                  I wasn't going to bring it up --
                  but rather than have you stumble
                  into it and make <u>another</u> mistake,
                  I'll tell you --
                         (she nervously puffs
                          her cigarette)
                  He was my assistant, but he was a
                  troublemaker...
                  He went out on his own as a free-
                  lance bio-exorcist -- claims to
                  get rid of the living... got into
                  more trouble -- you remember the
                  Chicago Fire...

        Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Juno continues.

                                JUNO
                         (continuing)
                  He was demoted to a Grade-6
                  malevolent spirit.  He's been
                  imprisoned on that plane ever
                  since... in fact, I believe he's
                  been sleezing around your cemetery
                  lately.  He can only be brought
                  back by saying his name three
                  times.

        Adam and Barbara attempt to interrupt --

                                JUNO
                         (continuing)
                  <u>But</u> I strongly suggest that you
                  remove the Deetz's <u>yourself</u>.

        She takes a final drag on the cigarette and smoke
        billows out the hole in her throat.  Juno starts to
        FADE.

                                ADAM
                  And if we need <u>you</u> again, how do
                  we...?

        Juno fades.  Gone.  Barbara goes to the model, looks
        at the cemetery.

                                BARBARA
                  That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh,
                  Adam.

                                ADAM
                         (holds her shoul-
                          ders, calms her)
                  Look, she's right.  We'll just
                  start simple, honey, be tougher.
                  I feel... confident.  C'mon.

        They exit.


        CAMERA FOLLOWS ACTION - OVER THE MODEL

        The FLY BUZZES.  It lands and crawls along into the model of
        the cemetery.


        THE FLY

        resplendently green and iridescent, pauses and fiddles
        with its hairy parts.  Starts to walk by.

                                VOICE
                  Pssstt!  Over here!

        Fly stops.  Tilts its multi-eyed head.


        ANOTHER ANGLE

        Two hands come up from the earth of that grave holding
        a candy bar.

                                VOICE
                  I can't use this.  You should have
                  it.  Flies get so little respect
                  anymore.


        THE FLATTERED FLY

        walks over to the grave.  In a flash, the hands grab
        the struggling fly and dance it like a doll over the
        grave and then pull it into the earth.

                                FLY
                  <u>Buzzz</u>!
                         (turns into)
                  <u>Help me</u>!  <u>Help me</u>!

        A MANIACAL LAUGH grows from the grave.  WIND BLOWS as
        the Fly disappears.  Ivy whips away from the grave-
        stone.  We see, for the first time, the chiseled name:

                                BETELGEUSE

        CLAP OF THUNDER.


        INT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT

        Charles is on the phone.  He has drawings laid out in
        front of him.  He is at his most urban persuasive, and
        oddly relaxed -- he is finally in his own element.

                                CHARLES
                  Maxie, have I not <u>always</u> made you
                  money?  I think that is the only
                  real question here.


        INT. MAXIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

        New York office, cool design, black couch, and MAXIE
        DEAN, a 55-year-old, super tan, white-haired wheeler
        dealer.  Sign says:  CHAIRMAN of BOTCO INDUSTRIES.
        Maxie looks rich and he looks cool as he talks to
        Charles.  Behind him, Sarah, his rich-looking blonde
        wife, is looking at herself in a mirror.

                                MAXIE
                  Well, Charles -- no one has made me
                  money like you.  Until your nerves
                  went, you were a demon.  It is
                  just that... Winter River,
                  Connecticut is, you'll forgive me,
                  no fucking where.  Why would I
                  invest that kind of money to buy
                  an old building way the hell up
                  there?


        INTERCUT CONVERSATION

                                CHARLES
                  Not a <u>building</u>!  That's the beauty
                  of it.  I think I can buy the
                  <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't
                  know the value of their property!

                                MAXIE
                  Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of
                  nowhere.

                                CHARLES
                  No, No -- C'mon, Max, you know
                  me.  I've got plans.  You gotta
                  come up here and see, then I'll
                  tell you about it.

        Maxie isn't much interested.

                                MAXIE
                  Well, sure, Charles, but I am busy
                  here... you know how it was when
                  you were active.

        This burns Charles.  But he swallows it.  He hears
        something in the corridor outside -- a kind of LOW
        MOANING.

                                CHARLES
                         (into telephone)
                  Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody.

                                MAXIE
                  No listen... we'll talk about
                  this visiting later, I gotta go,
                  I gotta meeting on the Japanese
                  joint venture.

                                CHARLES
                         (torn between the
                          MOANING and Maxie)
                  Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese
                  could <u>run</u> it for us.  Listen,
                  think right about it, will you?
                  We've almost got the house ready,
                  you bring Sarah with you and I'll
                  show you.

                                MAXIE
                  Yeah yeah, we'll think on it.
                  Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up
                  there, ya hear?

        Maxie hangs up.  Shakes his head.

                                MAXIE
                         (continuing)
                  Putz!  Inter River?  My ass.


        INT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT

        Charles hangs up frustrated.  MOANING INCREASES.  He
        goes to the door and flings it open.

        A figure is right there in the doorway -- A ghost under
        a sheet.  But a "designer" sheet.  He wails away like a
        banshee.  Eyeholes cut in sheets, Charles jumps, re-
        covers.

                                CHARLES
                  Oh, Jesus, Lydia!  Is Connecticut
                  so boring that you have to think
                  up shit like this?

        ON Barbara, she stands back away from the door observ-
        ing skeptically.

                                CHARLES
                         (continuing)
                  I had Maxie Dean on the phone!
                  Darling, Dad's found a way to make
                  some money here while I relax, so
                  scram!

        He slams the door, turns around.  Then turns around
        again, and jerks the door open.  The ghost is retreat-
        ing, beaten.

                                CHARLES
                         (continuing)
                  And your mother is going to kill
                  you when she sees that you cut
                  holes in her $300 sheets.  You
                  provoke her you know.  I mean she
                  can be an unreasonable bitch.  But
                  you <u>do</u> provoke her.

        He SLAMS the door again.


        INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

        Adam helps Barbara on with her sheet.

                                BARBARA
                  God, this is so corny.  Have we
                  been reduced to this?  Sheets?

                                ADAM
                  Think of them as death shrouds.
                  And the moaning is important.
                  Really <u>moan</u>!
                         (imitating Juno)
                  Practice, practice, practice.


        INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Television still going, Delia asleep with curlers.
        Adam and Barbara glide inside, go over and stand beside
        the bed.

                                ADAM
                  Deep breath... and...


        INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - NIGHT

        She has her ever-present camera around her neck.  Sud-
        denly hears MOANS from her parents' room.  Thinking it
        is sexual, she cringes.  Covers her ears.

                                LYDIA
                  Gross!  How can he stand that
                  woman?
                         (louder)
                  Hey, cut it out!  I'm a child!
                  For God sakes!

        The NOISE gets weirder.  Lydia gets interested.


        INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Adam and Barbara moan and groan.  Delia doesn't stir.

                                BARBARA
                  I feel really stupid.

                                ADAM
                  It's <u>not</u> stupid.  We're ghosts.
                  Do you want this woman for
                  breakfast for 125 years?  Moan
                  louder!

        Barbara moans louder and more weirdly.

        Delia stirs, sits up, but doesn't open her eyes.

        Adam and Barbara are excited then... disappointed as
        Delia fumbles on the bedside table for the remote con-
        trol device, and without opening her eyes, turns off
        the television set.  Then she turns over, and is lost
        to the world totally.

        Barbara sighs.  She and Adam walk toward the door.
        When they open it however, Lydia is standing there in
        her pajamas -- she snaps a FLASH Polaroid -- and Adam
        and Barbara jump backwards with yelps of fright.

                                LYDIA
                  Sick!  Sexual perversion!  If
                  you're going to do weird sexual
                  stuff you ought to stay in your
                  bedroom, okay?

        Lydia starts back into her room.  Then looks at the
        developing photograph.  Something catches her eye.

        Lydia yelps with fear.

                                LYDIA
                  Holy cow!  <u>No feet</u>!

        She screams.  Adam and Barbara scream.  Lydia rushes
        back toward them, starts flashing pictures.

        Adam and Barbara run around and are pushed into a
        corner.  Polaroids fly everywhere.

        Lydia runs out of film.  She stares at them, panting
        with fear.  A standoff.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  A... Are you the guys who're
                  hiding out in the attic?

                                ADAM
                         (fake terror voice)
                  We're ghosts.

        Barbara moans.

                                LYDIA
                         (skeptical, cautious)
                  W... What do you look like under
                  there?

        Adam and Barbara pull shut bedroom door, go out into
        the hall -- as if to keep from waking Delia with their
        conversation.


        INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

        All three stare at each other tentatively.

                                ADAM
                  Aren't you scared?

                                LYDIA
                  I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren.
                  Those are <u>sheets</u>.  Are you gross
                  under there?  Are you "Night of
                  the Living Dead" under there?
                  Like all bloody veins and pus?

                                ADAM
                  What?

                                LYDIA
                  "Night of the Living Dead?"  It's
                  a movie.

                                BARBARA
                         (pulling off
                          the sheet)
                  If I had seen a ghost at your age,
                  I would have been frightened out
                  of my wits.

                                LYDIA
                  You're not gross.  Why were you
                  wearing a sheet?

                                BARBARA
                  We're practicing.

                                ADAM
                  You can actually see us?  Without
                  the sheets?

                                LYDIA
                  Is this like a trick question?

                                BARBARA
                  Tell the truth.

                                LYDIA
                         (offended)
                  Of course I can see you.

                                ADAM
                  Nobody else can.

                                LYDIA
                  I'm wearing contacts... Also I
                  read through the "Handbook for the
                  Recently Deceased."  It says that
                  live people ignore the strange and
                  unusual... I, myself, <u>am</u> strange
                  and unusual.

                                BARBARA
                         (tenderly)
                  You look like a regular girl to me.

        Lydia blushes.  Barbara smiles warmly.  She is begin-
        ning to like Lydia.

                                ADAM
                  You read our book?  Could you
                  follow it?

        Lydia nods her head.

                                LYDIA
                  Why are you creeping around
                  Delia's bedroom?

                                ADAM
                  We were trying to scare your
                  mother.

                                LYDIA
                  Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive
                  about being related to reptiles.

        Barbara smiles.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  You can't scare her.  She's
                  sleeping with Prince Valium
                  tonight.
                         (defiantly)
                  I stole the key to your attic, you
                  know.

        Adam and Barbara look at each other.

                                BARBARA
                  Maybe we better talk.


        INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

        Adam's rigged up the moon, and stars, too.  Adam and
        Barbara and Lydia stand just beyond the fringes of the
        town, dimly lighted giants.

                                LYDIA
                  <u>You</u> did this?  You carved all
                  these little figures and houses
                  and things?

                                ADAM
                         (pleased)
                  I certainly did.  I'd finish it
                  too, but... I don't get out much.

                                LYDIA
                  And this used to be your house, I
                  bet.  Why do you want to scare
                  everybody?

                                ADAM
                  We want to frighten you away.
                         (a little embarrassed)
                  So that you'll move out.

                                LYDIA
                  You don't know the Deetz's very
                  well, do you?  My father bought
                  this place.  He never walks away
                  from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?

                                BARBARA
                  We can't.  We haven't left the
                  house since the funeral.

                                LYDIA
                  Funeral.  God, you guys <u>really are</u>
                  <u>dead</u>!
                         (fascinated)
                  What was it like?  The funeral.
                  Did you cry?

                                ADAM
                  We weren't there.  The handbook
                  says funerals aren't for the dead.

                                LYDIA
                  God, if this is true this is
                  <u>amazing</u>!  I kinda like it up
                  here.  Can I visit you sometimes?

                                ADAM
                  Well, I don't know... We don't get
                  many visitors.

                                BARBARA
                  You know you're really a pretty
                  girl.

        Lydia flushes.

                                CHARLES (O.S.)
                  Lydia!

                                LYDIA
                  I better go...

                                BARBARA
                  Wait... I don't think it would be
                  a very good idea if you told your
                  parents that we're up here.

                                ADAM
                  Unless you think it would scare
                  them off.

        Lydia starts to exit.

                                ADAM
                         (continuing)
                  You tell them that we are
                  desperate horrible ghoulish
                  creatures who will stop at nothing
                  to get back our house.

                                LYDIA
                         (looks him up
                          and down)
                  Wait a minute, what if this is a
                  dream?  Can you do any tricks to
                  prove I'm not dreaming?

        Barbara shakes her head, a little ashamed.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  Well, if you <u>are</u> real ghosts, you
                  better get another routine, those
                  sheets suck!

        She sneaks a smile at Barbara and exits.


        EXT. HOUSE - DAY

        A big ugly machine is doing something unnecessary to
        the yard.


        INT. DARKROOM/BASEMENT - DAY

        The FAST-TICKING CLOCK is a timer.  Lydia is making
        Polaroid enlargements.  She's quick and expert at this.
        She's examining a print with a magnifying glass.


        INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY

        Delia shrieks.  Going through the dirty clothes, she's
        just come across the sheets with the eye holes in them.

                                DELIA
                  Lydia!  Lydia!  My hands are
                  <u>shredded</u> from doing the laundry,
                  and now I have to deal with your
                  vandalism!


        INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

        Lydia, pounding up from the basement with the wet
        print, collides with Delia, rushing down from the sec-
        ond floor with the scissored sheets.

                                DELIA
                  Lydia, honest to God I'm going to
                  kill you.  I'm having a party
                  tonight.  <u>I'm</u> cooking, I can't get
                  servants.  Do I need angst?  No, I
                  certainly do not!

        Lydia speeds by her.

                                DELIA
                         (continuing)
                  You owe me three-hundred bucks,
                  Lydia!  Don't go running to your
                  father, you worm.


        INT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY

        Lydia rushes in.  Charles is working furiously on a
        word processor, amidst an array of maps and plans.

                                LYDIA
                  Dad.  Do you believe me?

                                CHARLES
                  Yes.  Except when you creep around
                  in your mother's --

                                LYDIA
                  Stepmother's...

                                CHARLES
                  ... sheets.

                                LYDIA
                  Well this is... I mean, this is
                  the weirdest --

                                CHARLES
                  Lydia, I don't know what it is
                  with you and these pratical
                  jokes, but --

                                LYDIA
                  <u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet
                  was full of ghosts.

        She hands him the photo.  He looks.  Lydia points
        out...

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  No feet.

        Charles laughs.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  You <u>don't</u> believe me.  That sheet
                  was full of ghosts.  They live
                  here.

        Charles begins to scroll through computer program.

                                CHARLES
                         (dismissing it)
                  Very clever, Lydia.  Now would you
                  please -- I'll tell you what... I
                  know!  You're bored, right?  You
                  take that camera and your bike
                  and photograph every building in
                  town.  Don't tell anyone what it's
                  for...
                         (handing her a
                          wad of bills)
                  Here, take some cash and go do
                  it.  How's that?  You want to
                  stretch, don't you?

        Lydia exits, with determination.  Charles looks up on
        the wall and runs his finger over a plat map of Winter
        River, just like Adam's in the attic.

                                CHARLES
                         (continuing)
                  Look at the size of these lots...

        Adam peers at the map, puzzled.

                                ADAM
                  What is this guy doing?

        Barbara follows Lydia out.  Adam thinks, intrigued.
        Exits.


        INT. KITCHEN - DAY

        Delia is frantically preparing for the evening's dinner
        party.  Lydia is very much in her way, trying to show
        her the photographs.  Delia isn't looking at them.

                                DELIA
                  I can't believe you are doing this
                  to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a
                  dinner party for seven people
                  tonight.  Otho has agreed to come
                  back for the demolition of the
                  attic.  My agent, Bernard, is
                  bringing some woman who writes for
                  "Art in America."  In fact, no one
                  here tonight has not been in
                  "Vanity Fair."  Except you.

                                LYDIA
                         (resigned)
                  I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to
                  be afraid.

                                DELIA
                  Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others
                  about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The
                  only thing that scares me is being
                  embarrassed in front of my
                  friends.  Do you know how hard it
                  is to get civilized people to set
                  foot in this part of Connecticut?
                  Not a solitary word of this
                  pubescent tripe to anyone.

        Lydia exits angrily.

        CAMERA HINGES.  Barbara is watching, horrified at
        Delia's occupation of her (Barbara's) kitchen.  Adam
        appears.

                                BARBARA
                  Lydia's trying, but they don't
                  believe her.

                                ADAM
                  She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.

                                BARBARA
                  Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!

                                ADAM
                  This is different.  Eventually
                  she'll take someone to the attic.
                  And then what?  We've got to try
                  to contact this guy Betelmyer.  We
                  gotta get some help, hon.


        INT. ATTIC ROOM - LATER - DAY

        Adam looks intently through the book.

        Barbara's eye is caught by something in the model
        cemetery.  She moves over and sees a small gravestone
        lit up by neon.

                                BARBARA
                  Adam!

        Adam comes over.  Looks.

                                ADAM
                  I didn't do that one... Hmmm.

                                BARBARA
                  It's him.  Look... Betelgeuse...
                  Betelgeuse...

        She looks at Adam, "should I?" Adam chews his lip
        thoughtfully.

                                ADAM
                  Go ahead... third time's a charm.

                                BARBARA
                         (after a deep breath)
                  <u>Betelgeuse</u>!

        ZAP!  They are transported into the model graveyard.


        EXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

        WIND BLOWS --  With shovels and lanterns, Adam and
        Barbara are unlikely gravediggers.  The mechanized
        clouds move in the sky across the mechanical moon,
        throwing weird shadows everywhere.  Ground fog creeps
        slowly along the graves.  It is so eerie.

                                BARBARA
                  What happened?

                                ADAM
                  Three times.  Powerful number.

                                BARBARA
                         (standing in front
                          of grave)
                  Bet... el... geuse.  What an
                  awful name.  I thought it was like
                  -- you know.  The <u>juice</u> of
                  <u>beetles</u>.

        Adam cringes too.

                                BARBARA
                         (continuing)
                  Where is he?  What do we do?

        Adam looks down at the grave.  Knocks on the stone.
        Nothing.

                                ADAM
                  Has anything been simple so far?
                  From the look of the shovel, we
                  dig.

                                BARBARA
                  Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.
                  My nails keep getting longer.
                  I'll break them.

        Hands her a shovel anyway.  She digs.


        EXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - LATER - NIGHT

        They're almost down six feet.  By now they are both
        almost out of sight in the grave.  Inside the grave --
        Adam suddenly hits wood.

                                BARBARA
                  It's about time.

        They lean down and brush dirt off a brass plate on the
        coffin.

                          "BETELGEUSE"

                                ADAM
                  I guess we open it.

                                BARBARA
                  Maybe we should knock first?

        A slight TREMOR shakes them.  They look at each other
        and try to scramble from the grave.


        TOPSIDE

        They just barely crawl out when a mouldering corpse
        springs out of the grave and jumps on Barbara's back,
        and plants a thousand-year-old kiss on her lips.  She
        screams and burbles.  Adam pulls the corpse off her
        back.  The corpse does a Three Stooges hammer on Adam's
        head.

        Adam staggers backward, unhurt but shocked.  All three
        stop.


        ON THE CORPSE

        Something unreal about him, almost mechanical.  Then
        the corpse, grinning insanely at them, flies straight
        up into the air over their heads.  He CRASHES against
        the tombstone...

        And Adam and Barbara see the corpse is only a huge
        marionette on a string and pole.  A LAUGH comes from
        behind the gravestone.


        PUPPETEER BETELGEUSE

        steps out.  He looks like someone who just crawled out
        from under a rock.  This is one slippery customer.
        Betelgeuse speaks in a rapid polyglot, choosing words
        and phrases from every slang in the world.  Barbara is
        mighty uneasy.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  All right.  Who are you?

                                BARBARA
                  We're...

                                BETELGEUSE
                  You're the dead.

                                ADAM
                  Aren't you dead?

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a
                  businessman.  I'm the man what
                  <u>am</u>.  <u>Beeet</u>el <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u>
                  do I gotta kill?

                                ADAM
                  You don't kill anyone.

                                BARBARA
                  Just get some people out of our
                  house.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Bio <u>busting</u>.  I <u>love</u> it.  Who do
                  I gotta kill?  Family -- right?
                  Obnoxious, I bet.
                         (contorting face)
                  Mommie, daddy, piglets.

                                BARBARA
                  Just one daughter.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!
                         (brushing yellow dust
                          off her)
                  I <u>hate</u> those Sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>!
                  I've lost a lot of buddies to
                  Sandworms.
                         (back to work)
                  So a daughter?  She got good legs?
                  God I love a young leg.

        Air blows up Barbara's dress, exposing her legs.  He
        leers.

                                BARBARA
                  She's only fourteen...

                                ADAM
                  ... acts like she's thirty-five.

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (rubbing hands)
                  How does she feel about short old
                  men with dirty ears?

        Barbara is grossed out and increasingly uneasy.  Beetle
        Juice senses it and gets back to business.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  <u>So</u> you, <u>the dead</u>, want me, <u>the</u>
                  <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys --
                  Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who
                  might not mind a tumble with an
                  older guy, out into the cold?
                  Even though they have paid hard
                  casharoonie for your dump?

                                ADAM
                  But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u>
                  our house.

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (scolding sarcasm)
                  You Maitlands are the backbone of
                  the afterlife.  So what's my cut?

                                ADAM
                  Can you scare them off?

        Beetle Juice looks offended.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Me, scary?  You be the judge.


        ANGLE

        He swirls his face and shoulders into a horrifying
        image.  Pleased, he laughs at himself.

                                BARBARA
                         (decisively)
                  Honey.  Let's go.

                                ADAM
                  Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need
                  help.

                                BARBARA
                  No, we don't.  We can work
                  something out ourselves.  We just
                  have to try harder.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Hold on.  Let's not be squeamish,
                  missy.  You rang my bell, you
                  gotta lick the pump.  I'm rolling!


        BARBARA

        grabs Adam.  Betelgeuse is getting mad.  Not pretty.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at
                  your service.  You be the judge.
                  I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.

                                BARBARA
                  Home.  <u>Home</u>.  <u>Home</u>!


        ZAP

        They are gone.  Betelgeuse is furious.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  You fresh corpse creeps!  Who do
                  you think you are?... Walking
                  away from a professional?


        BETELGEUSE

        walks to a tree and kicks it hard.  The whole huge tree
        falls, KABLOOM!


        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        A small tree falls in the model.  Adam, across the
        room, walks over and straightens it.

        He looks at Barbara who is poring over the handbook.
        Making notes.  Counting out procedures.

                                ADAM
                  Honey, I think that was a mistake.

                                BARBARA
                  I am not going to expose that
                  little girl to that... pervert
                  down there.

                                ADAM
                  How'd you do that?

                                BARBARA
                         (proud of herself)
                  Just a hunch... remember things
                  come in threes -- three times in,
                  three times out... I'm getting the
                  hang of this stuff.

                                ADAM
                  I think we really pissed him off.

                                BARBARA
                  I don't care...

                                ADAM
                  But we let him out.

                                BARBARA
                  I've changed my mind... I feel
                  <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting
                  better at this stuff.  We can
                  scare them off ourselves --
                  tonight!  I've got an idea.
                  You're going to love it... I'm
                  going to hate it.


        ADAM

        turns to look down at the model again.  Straightens the
        tree.  Turns away.  We can see a tiny light moving
        through the tiny model forest towards the house.

                                ADAM (V.O.)
                  Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure
                  seemed mad.

                                BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
                         (singing)
                  Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I
                  go!


        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        Dinner for seven, as promised.  Everything looks very
        nice.  Deetzes are in control and in their element.
        The element is neurotic-chic.

        Some of the guests are affecting distaste for having
        had to make the long drive to Connecticut.  There's a
        bitchy feud going on between GRACE, the "Art In Amer-
        ica" writer, and BERNARD, Delia's agent, that threatens
        to become a full-scale war.

        Otho is drunkish and engaged in his third favorite
        occupation -- direct attacks on the personal weaknesses
        of his friends.  He's singled out his victim, BERYL,
        the editor for Ballantine, a frail-looking woman who is
        dressed "artistically."

                                OTHO
                         (to Beryl)
                  Well, darling, you can only have a
                  hysterectomy once, so why don't you
                  tell us what you <u>really</u> went into
                  the hospital for last week?  Or dare
                  I ask, is that a nose "nouveau?"

                                CHARLES
                         (privately; to
                          Otho)
                  Otho, you've got to help me get
                  Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal
                  that could make all of us very
                  comfortable.

                                OTHO
                  He's a cloven-hooved beast!

                                CHARLES
                  He's your cousin.

                                OTHO
                  I am ashamed to say he is.  Look,
                  nothing short of giving away free
                  sacks of money would get him up
                  here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget
                  it.  You can't get her out of
                  Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
                         (still on Beryl's
                          case)
                  I just hope it wasn't yet another of
                  your dreary suicide attempts.  You
                  know what they say about people who
                  who commit suicide.  In the afterlife,
                  they become civil servants.

                                BERNARD
                  Otho!  I didn't know you were into
                  the supernatural?

                                OTHO
                  Of course you remember!  After my
                  stint with the living theatre.  I
                  was one of New York City's leading
                  paranormal researchers until the
                  bottom dropped out of the business
                  in '72.

                                BERYL
                         (sick to death of
                          this blowhard)
                  Paranormal... Is that what they're
                  calling your kind now?

        Lydia watches Otho thoughtfully.  Suddenly very cur-
        ious.

        Delia senses that Lydia might talk ghosts here.

                                DELIA
                         (a threat; quietly
                          to Lydia)
                  Don't you <u>dare</u>.

                                LYDIA
                  I saw some ghosts.

        All quiet.

                                DELIA
                         (interrupting)
                  Lydia tried to play a most
                  amusing joke on me this afternoon.

                                LYDIA
                  It wasn't a joke.

                                DELIA
                  Tried to convince me that this
                  house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids.
                  Kids!  I love them.

        Otho's glance sharpens at this.  Everyone else listens.

                                GRACE
                  By ghosts?

                                LYDIA
                  By what else?

                                DELIA
                         (laughing it away)
                  In sheets yet.  <u>Designer</u> sheets.
                  They --

        Charles, seeing things aren't going well for Delia,
        proposes a toast.

                                CHARLES
                  I propose a toast to our intrepid
                  friends.  Who braved the
                  expressway and fourteen toll
                  booths to visit us.  May your
                  buildings go condo.

        All lift their wineglasses.  All drink.  All synchro-
        nously spit out their wine.  All together now...

                                EVERYONE
                  Yechhh!

        Charles lifts the wine bottle from the cooler.  Disgust
        spans the room.

        ON bottle -- it bears the familiar spread wings of
        Thunderbird!

                                BERYL
                  Thunderbird wine?  My God, Delia,
                  don't you even have a Safeway up
                  here?

                                DELIA
                         (horrified; but
                          recovering)
                  Joke <u>Joke</u>!  Charles get the good
                  wine and I'll serve the shrimp.
                  It's a joke.

        Delia stares a spike through Lydia.  Delia and Charles
        rush into the kitchen.  Otho looks at his glass and
        peers at Lydia.


        INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

        Delia rushes to get the sushi.  Charles finds some
        good wine.

                                DELIA
                         (rapidly; furious)
                  Lydia switched wines.  Charles --
                  if you do not agree <u>right now</u>, to
                  boarding school, you can forget
                  having what <u>you</u> call sex -- ever
                  again in your natural lifetime.

        He nods reluctantly.  She rushes back to guests.


        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        Lydia is looking around curiously.  Delia and Charles
        rush back in with sushi and good wine.  Delia pours for
        Bernard, the obvious connoisseur.  He tastes the wine.
        All wait.  Is it Kerosene du Pape?  He smiles.  All
        smile.

        Otho is more interested in Lydia's story.  He leans
        toward her...

                                OTHO
                  Now, Lydia... Favor us about your
                  ghosts.

                                DELIA
                  <u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this
                  little... person.

                                OTHO
                  Oh, Delia, lighten up!

                                DELIA
                  She's been without therapy up here
                  and I will not allow her to
                  ruin...

        But then:


        DELIA

        Something comes over her -- she straightens, then
        crouches a little, her hand sweeps across in front of
        her, almost mechanically.  And then our Delia Deetz,
        unable to help herself, leaves the whitebread world
        behind and possessed, sings in someone else's voice, a
        rich, NEGRO TENOR.

                                DELIA
                  "If I didn't care, More than
                  words could say."

        Lydia's eyes widen.  MUSIC UP.  All the guests are
        spellbound.

        Charles, too, has the beat -- The Ink Spots in his eyes.
        In a voice not his own.

                                CHARLES
                  "If my every prayer, did not
                  begin and end with <u>just</u> your
                  name."

        Delia is shocked.  She looks at Lydia.

                                DELIA
                  For God's sake, stop me...

        She is cut short by her powerful inspiration.

                                DELIA
                  "I could not be true to you
                  beyond compare."


        ALL THE GUESTS

        except Lydia, are possessed to become the chorus.  They
        stand by their chairs, they spin in perfect Motown
        choreography.

                                EVERYONE
                         (except Lydia)
                  "Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop."

                                DELIA
                  "If I didn't care... for you..."

                                EVERYONE
                  "Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop."

        A look of sheer delight comes across Lydia's face,
        unlike anything we have previously seen.  She dances
        and claps her hands in time with the music.  She is in
        teen heaven.

        NOTE:  Delia and the guests are fully aware of their
        singing/actions, but helpless to stop themselves.  While
        it is funny, it is nevertheless just a little frighten-
        ing.

        Lydia excitedly looks around the room to see if she can
        see the ghosts.  She can't.

        Now the song pauses... Everyone tries to recover for a
        shocked second.  Instead, the tempo changes.

        As the tempo quickens, the guest/chorus is syncopated
        like alternating pistons as they are pushed and pulled
        into their chairs.  They sing throughout.


        THE SONG

        crashes to its end.  Bernard looks down at his shrimp
        cocktail.  The shrimp draped over the rice roll
        suddenly rears up like a hand and, making a tiny fist,
        grabs his dangling tie and... <u>smash</u> --

        WIDER -- All the guests are punched by the shrimp, back
        over their chairs to the ground.  They are stunned. 
        Suddenly everyone runs frightened into the next room.


        EXT./INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

        Adam and Barbara with huge smiles on their faces, dance
        the bugaloo then hug and kiss on the landing in front
        of the attic.  Door is open.

                                TOGETHER
                  <u>We did it</u>!

                                ADAM
                  Let's watch 'em scatter.

        They enter the attic and run to the window.  Look out
        over the front yard.


        YARD OF HOUSE - THEIR POV - NIGHT

        filled with the cars of the guests, as well as Delia
        and Charles' vehicles.

                                ADAM (O.S.)
                  Any minute now.  They'll all run
                  screaming.


        BACK TO SCENE

        They wait.  Nothing moving outside.

                                BARBARA
                  Your Ink Spots were <u>won</u>derful!

        Adam smiles proudly.

                                ADAM
                  And your shrimp was remarkable.

                                BARBARA
                  <u>My</u> shrimp?  I did the wine.
                  Didn't you do the sushi?

                                ADAM
                  N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.

                                BARBARA (V.O.)
                  Who did the?

        Timid KNOCK at the door of the attic.

        Barbara glances at Adam.  They don't know what to do.

                                LYDIA
                         (from outside the
                          door)
                  It's me.  Lydia.

        Adam, puzzled, goes to the door and opens it.  Lydia is
        standing there, sheepish.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  They'd like for you to come
                  downstairs.  Delia says you can
                  pick any sheets you want.


        INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        The guests are sitting expectantly.  The photographs
        are being passed around.  The wheels are turning in
        Charles' mind --  he sees a gold mine.  Everyone speaks
        at once.

                                DELIA
                  It does indicate a marvelously
                  urbane sense of humor on the part
                  of these ghosts -- that they
                  actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!

                                OTHO
                  We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn
                  here, a very sophisticated pair.  We
                  must protect them, treat them with
                  respect.  <u>Nur</u>ture them.

                                CHARLES
                  People will pay big money for
                  this.  Right, Grace?

                                GRACE
                         (nodding)
                  Charles, I want to know why you
                  didn't tell me about this --

                                DELIA
                         (now changing her
                          tune)
                  We were waiting for proof.
                  Lydia's photographs...

        Charles is scheming.

                                BERNARD
                         (skeptical)
                  What are you all talking about?
                  We... we just got a little drunk,
                  that's all.

                                OTHO
                  No matter how drunk you get, <u>you</u>
                  can<u>not</u> sound like the Ink Spots.
                         (to Charles)
                  Charles, this is <u>it</u>!  You can <u>get</u>
                  Maxie Dean up here now.

        Charles plots and plans.

                                OTHO
                  His wife Sarah <u>loves</u> the
                  <u>supernatural</u>.  I did a reading for
                  her just last week.  Told her her
                  jowls would tighten soon.  I mean
                  she will make him <u>sprint</u> up here in
                  his helicopter if you can produce
                  ghosts for her.

                                BERYL
                  The "Enquirer" has offered fifty
                  thousand dollars for absolute
                  proof of life after death.  I'll
                  send them over.

                                BERNARD
                  I'm Delia's agent!  I've lost
                  money for years on her work.  If
                  anything <u>actually</u> happened here,
                  I'll handle it, thank you.  But
                  not until I see some real proof.

        Lydia appears at the base of the stairs.  Everyone
        stops squabbling, looks at her expectantly.

                                LYDIA
                  They don't want to come down.

                                OTHO
                  Why not?

        Bernard shakes his head as if all this were an elaborate
        hoax.  He harumphs!

                                LYDIA
                  I think the reason is they were
                  trying to scare you, and you
                  didn't get scared --

                                DELIA
                  Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.
                         (looking around)
                  Just a little startled.  One of
                  those shrimp dropped down my
                  Kamali.

        Bernard is now convinced this whole business was a put-
        on.

                                BERNARD
                         (shaking his head)
                  Total collective hallucination.

                                BERYL
                  I <u>was</u> a little tipsie.

                                DELIA
                  This was <u>not</u> a hallucination,
                  people.  This was <u>real</u>, really
                  totally real.

                                GRACE
                  Of course, they <u>were</u> rather
                  spectacular effects -- for
                  Connecticut, I mean.

                                OTHO
                  All presences have a home space.  A
                  place where they live, so to speak.
                  Where do they hide out?

                                LYDIA
                         (reluctantly)
                  The attic.

                                CHARLES
                  The attic room is locked --

                                LYDIA
                  They're ghosts.  They do what they
                  want.

                                OTHO
                  <u>Fab</u>ulous!  Otho Fenlock's "Locked
                  Door" ghosts!  Probably committed
                  suicide up there -- hanging like
                  beeves from the rafters.  I'm
                  totally enchanted.

        Bernard gathers Grace and Beryl and walks out the door.

                                BERNARD
                  Delia, you are a flake.  You have
                  always <u>been</u> a flake.  I'm packing
                  up and going back to the tricks of
                  the city.  That I can manage.  If
                  you <u>must</u> frighten people, do it
                  with your sculpture.

        They exit.  Delia is horrified and embarrassed.

                                DELIA
                  Wait!  I'm going to get to the
                  bottom of this!  Lydia, is this
                  some high-tech trick of yours?  I
                  want you to take us up there tout
                  sweet!


        INT. LANDING OUTSIDE OF ATTIC

        Delia, Charles, Otho and Lydia -- creep, creep.

                                DELIA
                         (whispering)
                  Shhh.  They're in there?  God,
                  they live like animals.  <u>This</u> is
                  where they've been hiding out?

        Lydia nods.  Delia suddenly, brashly pounds on the
        door.

                                DELIA
                         (shouting)
                  All right, you dead people!  Come
                  on out, or we'll break down this
                  door and drag you out on the ropes
                  you hanged yourself with!

                                LYDIA
                  Shhhh.  They didn't commit
                  suicide.

                                DELIA
                  It doesn't matter.
                  What matters is I've got a roomful
                  of guests down there, who think
                  I'm a fraud.
                         (to Lydia)
                  I am going to teach you something
                  here Lydia.  You've <u>got</u> to take
                  the right tone in things like
                  this, or people -- whether they're
                  dead or alive -- people will walk
                  all <u>over</u> you.
                         (loud)
                  Come on out, or I will make death
                  so miserable that you will wish
                  you had never <u>lived</u>!

        Delia pounds on door, which opens with an eerie CREAK.


        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        Lydia is pushed in first.  She looks around.  Delia,
        Charles and Otho come in next, carefully.  One by one
        they straighten up and look around.

                                DELIA
                         (whisper)
                  So where are they, Lydia?

        Lydia shrugs, looks around.

                                CHARLES
                         (off-handedly)
                  Answer your mother.

                                LYDIA
                  Listen, you guys.  These ghosts
                  are really nice people.  I think
                  we scared them off.  Let's just
                  leave them alone.  Okay?

        Charles is suddenly transfixed.  He stares at the
        model.

                                CHARLES
                  It's the whole damn <u>town</u>.

        They gather around.  Lydia is a little sad as she looks
        at the empty room and the model.

                                OTHO
                  Look at that <u>detail</u>!

                                DELIA
                  Look at the tiny figures.

                                CHARLES
                  Look at all that <u>parking</u>!

                                LYDIA
                  Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.

                                OTHO
                  They're not here, Lydia?

        She shakes her head.  Otho spots the handbook.  Palms
        it.

                                DELIA
                  I have <u>never</u> been so
                  embarrassed... They haven't gone
                  for good, have they?

        Delia is suddenly out the door, urging them all outside.

                                DELIA
                         (continuing)
                  Everyone <u>out</u> of there.  If they're
                  in there somewhere, I don't want
                  to scare them away.  Come on now,
                  stay out of there.  We've got work
                  to do.

        Otho pockets the handbook secretly as everyone exits.
        Delia carefully closes the door.


        CAMERA EASES OVER TO THE WINDOW

        We see two pairs of hands, white-knuckled, gripping the
        window sill from the outside.


        EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

        Barbara and Adam are hanging outside the window.
        CAMERA EASES BACK to see that instead of hanging from
        the house --

        They are hanging from a ledge over The Inferno --


        ON INFERNO

        circles of rosy hell.  Several devilish Monsters slaver
        up at them, hoping for new meat for the furnace.  Small
        geysers spurt foul gasses.


        WINDS

        BLOW hard on Adam and Barbara.  They struggle to hold
        on and pull themselves back up and into the window.

                                ADAM
                  Juno, help!  Juno!

        After nearly falling, Adam barely saves Barbara and
        they finally make it up, and disappear into the window.


        INT. ATTIC LANDING - NIGHT

        Delia, Charles and Otho all start down the stairs, one
        by one.  All are holding the handrail.

                                DELIA
                  Lydia, I will never forgive you
                  for embarrassing me in front of my
                  social inferiors.  You help us
                  with these ghosts or you'll be
                  sorry.

                                LYDIA
                  I'm sorry already.

                                CHARLES
                         (fixing on Otho)
                  Now, let's get back to business.  I
                  I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah
                  up here immediately.  I can make
                  history here!  I'm going to turn
                  this sleepy little backward town
                  into a leading supernatural
                  research center... and amusement
                  park.

                                LYDIA
                         (disgusted)
                  I cannot believe this.

                                CHARLES
                  Delia will cook...

        Delia glares at him.

                                CHARLES
                         (continuing)
                  I'll bring the wine... and the
                  business plan.  And Lydia --
                  you'll bring the ghosts.

                                LYDIA
                         (frustrated)
                  I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're
                  not here!

                                CHARLES
                  ... Otho, could you actually... do
                  something with them?

                                OTHO
                         (pats the handbook
                          under his coat)
                  Perhaps... if I were properly
                  motivated...

                                LYDIA
                  That's slavery and murder.  You
                  don't know them.  They're nice
                  people!

        POV -- down the handrail, as they walk downstairs.
        Lydia lags behind, sullen.


        LOWER END OF THE HANDRAIL

        lifts, and turns.  The handrail has become a long, fat,
        diamond-backed snake -- unlike any we have ever seen.
        It flashes terrifying steel teeth and a red-feathered
        comb.  It turns and HISSES at them.


        ON DELIA

        She screams as she looks down at her hand on the rail
        -- it grips the scaly, throbbing, dripping body of the
        snake.


        THE SNAKE

        just gets longer and nastier as it turns back in the
        air, up the stairs toward them.  Its tail circles Delia
        and spins her like a top.  When she stops -- the snake
        gives her a big wet snake kiss.


        SNAKE

        snaps Otho in the behind.  It hurts.


        THE SNAKE

        rears up and spreads a red-comb and HISSES loudly.


        ALL THREE

        of them fall over each other trying to escape.


        THE SNAKE

        hovers horribly over them.  Grabs Charles in its coils
        and squeezes him hard -- his fearful face reddens, then
        it suspends Charles over the edge of the stairs.

                                SNAKE
                  We've come for your daughter,
                  Chuck!


        HE

        leers at Lydia and drops Charles like a rock over the
        bannister.  Charles screams.


        THE SNAKE

        Grins at a terrified Lydia.


        SNAKE

        rears back for a strike, when suddenly, like thunder.
        One word is heard.

                                BARBARA
                  <u>Betelgeuse!  Betelgeuse!</u>
                  <u>Betelgeuse!</u>


        THE SNAKE

        looks up with familiar eyes.  At top of stairs stands
        an angry Barbara.

        What happens next is almost too fast for the eye to
        see.


        THE SNAKE

        shrinks and turns back into the regular mahogany hand-
        rail.


        BETELGEUSE

        or his outline, whips up the stairs, through the door,
        and is gone like a rocket.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  RRRatt shit!


        OTHO AND DELIA

        rush downstairs -- Lydia is terrified.  She runs away.

                                LYDIA
                  I hate you!  I thought you were my
                  friends.

                                BARBARA
                  No, wait!

        Lydia screams and runs down the stairs.

                                LYDIA
                         (screams)
                  I hate all of you!

        Slowly, Barbara returns to the attic.


        INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

        Adam and Barbara are exhausted.  Agitated.

                                ADAM
                  Great choice we've got here.  We
                  get to spend the next century
                  either hanging out that window or
                  doing parlor tricks.

        Adam is working with the model town.  Barbara is pac-
        ing.

                                ADAM
                  Maybe they'll leave now.  That
                  snake was a pretty nasty customer.

                                BARBARA
                  He might have hurt somebody.

                                ADAM
                  But he didn't.  We've got him
                  where we want him.


        ON THE MODEL

        A column of water shoots high in the air.

        Adam rushes over to the model -- looks down.


        INT. MODEL - DAY

        Betelgeuse has run a beat-up old pickup into a fire
        hydrant.  He stands nearby, hopping mad; shakes his
        fist at Adam.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  You pansy-assed cretins!  How <u>dare</u>
                  you do that to me.  I coulda
                  finished the job!


        IN THE ATTIC

        Barbara and Adam, obviously disturbed, look at one
        another with concern.

                                BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
                         (thin and pip-
                          ing voice)
                  Why did you stop me?

                                BARBARA
                  I don't like Charles Deetz
                  particularly, but you could have
                  <u>killed</u> him.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Hey, I've been bottled up for six
                  hundred years.  Every dog has his
                  day.  This is my town.  I need a
                  night to howl.

                                ADAM
                  This is <u>my</u> town.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  You wish!  I nearly scored with
                  that little blonde.  I need me a
                  short little queen.


        ANGLE

        Angry, Barbara reaches down into the model and plucks
        Betelgeuse up.

        Barbara lifts him up toward her, squeezing him
        slightly.

                                BARBARA
                  You leave her alone, you horrid
                  little prick!


        CLOSEUP - BETELGEUSE IN BARBARA'S HAND

        Betelgeuse grins.  Suddenly large spikes shoot out all
        over his body, piercing the skin of Barbara's palm and
        fingers.  Barbara's blood is a rich pink.

        She squeals and releases the evil spirit and he plum-
        mets.


        EXT. MODEL - DAY

        Betelgeuse lands on the town common.  Betelgeuse is
        defiant.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Go ahead.  Make my millenium!


        ANGLE

        We hear the tinny strains of "Honky Tonk Angel" as if
        from down the street.  He turns around to follow it.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  This burg got a cathouse?  I'm
                  getting anxious if you know what I
                  mean.  Six hundred years and all.

        He turns the corner to a whorehouse, with women --
        women with demon horns -- hanging out of the window,
        beckoning.  Betelgeuse rubs his hands together and
        swaggers inside.


        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        Barbara aghast, watching this from above.

                                BARBARA
                  <u>Adam</u>!  Why did you build a whore
                  house?  Have you ever been to...?

                                ADAM
                  I didn't --


        ANGLE

        He doesn't finish -- a strong WIND blows through the
        attic, nearly knocking Barbara and Adam over.  They
        close their eyes against the gale.

        When they open their eyes again, they're no longer in
        the attic.  They're in --


        INT. JUNO'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

        A cubicle in a much larger office.  Miss Argentina
        swishes by.

                                RECEPTIONIST
                  God, you have got her steaming
                  now.

        She exits.  There are other special workers.  The place
        is really, really busy.  Adam and Barbara sit down to
        wait.  Juno storms through with a sheaf of papers.  She
        sees them.  She is steaming mad.

                                JUNO
                  The whorehouse was my idea.  I
                  want Betelgeuse out of the
                  picture!  We've got some serious
                  talking to do.

                                BARBARA
                  About what?

                                JUNO
                  You people have really screwed
                  up!  I received word that you
                  allowed yourselves to be
                  <u>photographed</u>.  And you let
                  Betelgeuse out and didn't put him
                  back, and you let Otho get ahold
                  of the handbook.

                                ADAM
                  Handbook?  When...?

                                JUNO
                         (continuing tirade)
                  <u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u>
                  have a routine haunting like yours
                  provide incontrovertible visual
                  proof of existence beyond death.

                                ADAM
                  Well, we didn't know --


        A BUNCH OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS

        follow Juno like hungry dogs.

                                DUMB #1
                  Hey, Coach, where's the men's
                  room?

                                JUNO
                         (frustrated)
                  I'm <u>not</u> your coach.  He survived.

                                DUMB #2
                  You don't need a men's room.
                  You're not no man no more.  But
                  Coach, let me get this -- What's
                  our curfew over here?

        They start squabbling.  Juno has to wrangle them into
        another room.

                                JUNO
                         (frustrated)
                  I'll be right back.


        INT. KITCHEN - DAY

        Charles sits at the table with a small bandage on his
        head.  Delia takes off her Gucci belt and whips it on a
        chair absent-mindedly.

                                DELIA
                  I feel like we've been at war,
                  Charles.

                                CHARLES
                  At least insofar as we have our
                  first casualty.  Me.

                                DELIA
                  Otho'll know what to do.

                                CHARLES
                  What's he going to do?  Viciously
                  rearrange their environment?

                                DELIA
                  Otho knows just as much about the
                  supernatural as he knows about
                  interior design.

                                CHARLES
                  Let's hope he knows how to produce
                  those damn ghosts for Max and
                  Sarah... Because I've bought
                  options on property all over town.
                  I need Max's financing...

                                DELIA
                  Just don't tell Lydia.

                                CHARLES
                  Why not?

                                DELIA
                  I think she's in with them.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


        INT. LYDIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

        It's dark.  The bedroom curtains have been closed.
        DRAMATIC OPERA MUSIC builds throughout.

        Lydia melodramatically dressed in a long black dress
        appears carrying a candle.  She is softly crying.

        She sits at her dressing table, the candlelight shows
        her writing paper.  She begins a very dramatic letter.

                                LYDIA
                  I am alone.

        She looks at it and crumpling the paper, starts again.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  I am <u>utterly</u>... alone.  You have
                  sealed my fate with your betrayal.
                  I can no longer stand to be used
                  like a puppet between two
                  deceitful worlds.  By the time you
                  read this, I will be gone, having
                  jumped off...

        She scratches that out.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  ... having <u>plummeted</u> off the
                  Winter River Bridge.  Then you
                  will know that I am no longer a
                  toy in your petty feuds.  Goodbye,
                  Lydia.

        A tear falls on the paper as she folds it and puts it
        in an envelope.  OPERA MUSIC BUILDS AND CONTINUES.


        INT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY

        Lydia slowly makes a copy of the suicide note.  The
        green of the Xerox light falls eerily on her sad face.


        INT. HALLWAY - DAY

        Lydia at bottom of attic stairs.


        LYDIA'S POV - STAIRS AND DOOR AT TOP

        They look ominous.  She starts upward.


        INT. ATTIC ROOM - DAY

        The door opens and Lydia peers in.

        The room is empty.  Lydia comes inside.

                                LYDIA
                  Are you here?

        She hears SOMETHING.  Looks all around the room.
        Nothing.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come
                  for the last time?
                         (laying note on
                          table)
                  Where are you?  Barb...

                                BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
                  They're dead.

        Lydia looks around, then peers into model.

                                BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
                         (continuing)
                  Think small.  I'm talking to you.


        EXT. MODEL TOWN - BUILDING ROOF - DAY

        A tiny Betelgeuse on the roof of a building, wearing a
        silk dressing gown, looking like he just dragged him-
        self out of bed.  One of the horned whores is nude,
        sunbathing in the corner, and Betelgeuse drapes a
        blanket over her.  Lydia's face looms enormous in the
        sky.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Cookie, they are dead, dead,
                  deadski.

                                LYDIA
                  Of course they're dead.  They're
                  ghosts.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  No, I mean they've gone.
                  Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.

                                LYDIA
                  Where'd they go?

                                BETELGEUSE
                  The happy hunting ground.  Who
                  cares?

                                LYDIA
                  Are you a spirit too?

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh.
                  Listen, cookie, I've been trapped
                  in this burg for hundreds of
                  years.  All I want is to get out.

                                LYDIA
                  I want to get in.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  You do?  Over here?  On <u>my</u> side?

                                LYDIA
                  I think so.

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (scheming quickly)
                  Well, yes, of course.  It's great
                  over here.  You'll meet all the
                  greats.  James Dean.  Sid
                  Vicious...

                                LYDIA
                  Well, it can't be any worse than
                  my life here.

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (sinister, encouraging
                          her)
                  That's right.  They treat you like
                  scum, I bet?

                                LYDIA
                  Yeah.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  I can't help you from this side,
                  but here's how we do it.  So
                  <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three
                  times.  That's all.  I'll be all
                  yours.  Then I'll bring you over
                  here in style.

                                LYDIA
                  I... I don't know what your name is.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Minor problem.  The rules.  I
                  can't tell it to you.  But.. do
                  you know how to play charades?

                                LYDIA
                  Yes.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Of course you do.

        He holds up two fingers in a V.

                                LYDIA
                  Two words.

        Betelgeuse holds up one finger.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  First word.

        Betelgeuse puts two fingers on his arm.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  Three syllables.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  No, dummy.  Two.

                                LYDIA
                  Your fingers are so small I can't
                  see them.  First word -- two
                  syllables.

        He points behind her.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  I don't know what that signal
                  means.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  It means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.


        ANGLE

        Lydia looks behind her.  A greet beetle the size of a
        Volkswagen is crouching.  Its feathery antennae reach
        out toward her menacingly.  Lydia yelps.

                                LYDIA
                  Beetle!

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Good girrrl!

        POP!  The beetle disappears.  Betelgeuse holds up two
        fingers.

                                LYDIA
                         (still shaken)
                  Second word.  Be careful.


        ANGLE

        Apprehensive, she jumps when a simple carton of orange
        juice materializes.  Orange juice pours out into a
        ghostly glass.

                                LYDIA
                  Breakfast?  Orange?

        The orange juice disappears.  He shakes his head.

                                LYDIA
                  Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle
                  fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit Battle?
                  Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Good thing you are a beautiful
                  kid.  You are <u>dumb</u>!

        Betelgeuse does the signal for "Now Put Them Together."

                                LYDIA
                  I am <u>not</u>!  Beetle... Juice?

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (jumping with delight)
                  That's it!

                                LYDIA
                  Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch!
                  That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  It's spelled different, but
                  basically... Now you said it
                  twice, just one more time.  And
                  I'll be free.
                         (sinister)
                  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.

        Lydia, puzzled, gets the magnifying glass and peers at
        him.


        ON HIS UGLY FACE BIG IN THE GLASS

        Betelgeuse jumps in the air, his robe parts -- we don't
        see anything, but maybe Lydia does.

                                LYDIA
                  God, you're anatomically correct!

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Just <u>say</u> it.

                                LYDIA
                         (recognizing something
                          about him)
                  You were the snake!  Right?  I
                  know.  It was you.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  You've <u>got</u> to say it!

                                LYDIA
                  No I don't.  I don't take orders
                  from Smurfs.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  How'd you like to be married to...
                  the King...?

        Lydia doesn't get it.

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (continuing)
                  ... <u>Elvis</u>?...
                         (boasting)
                  You know, ever since he came over
                  he and I have been just like this.
                         (crosses his fingers)
                  I can arrange it.  Just say my
                  name one more time.

        She thinks about that one.  Shakes her head.

                                LYDIA
                  No, No... I need to talk to
                  Barbara.

        Betelgeuse smiles.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Well, cookie, just say my name.  I
                  can get her.
                         (rubbing his horny little
                          hands together)
                  That and <u>so</u> much more...

        Lydia walks around thinking for a moment.

                                LYDIA
                  Who else did you say is over
                  there?


        INT. JUNO'S OFFICE - DAY

        Juno staring at them, hard.

                                JUNO
                  Yes... or no?  Do you want the
                  Deetzes out or in?

                                ADAM
                  <u>Out</u>.

                                BARBARA
                  What about Betelgeuse?

                                JUNO
                  Forget him.  He'll remain with his
                  whores until someone calls him.
                  You need to worry about people like
                  <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of
                  phony trance mediums.  They
                  usually can't make the formulas
                  work, but if Otho stumbles on the
                  right words in that handbook... he
                  could hurt you.  As in --
                  <u>exorcism</u>.

        They both look puzzled.

                                JUNO
                         (continuing)
                  In plain English -- that's death
                  for the dead.  I don't care what
                  it takes, just get them out of
                  there <u>now</u>.  It's not pretty, but
                  -- that's death!

        Adam stands to go.

                                JUNO
                         (continuing)
                  Wait a minute.  Let's see what
                  you're going to do...

        They look at Juno.

                                JUNO
                         (continuing)
                  ... to scare her.  I want to make
                  sure it's not some silly parlor
                  trick.

        Barbara looks at Adam.

                                ADAM
                  I'll do the hard part, hon.


        ADAM

        reluctantly pulls on his face, and contorts it into a
        living, breathing, horror.  Juno is even a little
        repulsed.

                                JUNO
                  Not bad.  Not bad.  Now you?  Go
                  ahead.


        ANGLE

        She reluctantly does with her face a minor version of
        Adam's horror.

                                JUNO
                         (continuing)
                  Okay.  You look great!  Now go
                  clean house.  And don't forget the
                  photographs and the damned
                  handbook.


        ANGLE

        Barbara and Adam slowly stand and walk out the door.
        Barbara/Monster looks back pleadingly.  Football
        players flood into Juno's office.  One PARTICULARLY
        DUMB PLAYER has a revelation.  (He's pretty grisly,
        maybe sat too close to the engine.)

                                PARTICULARLY DUMB PLAYER
                  Coach!  Coach, I don't think we
                  survived the crash!

        Barbara and Adam look at each other and continue out the
        door.


        OUTSIDE JUNO'S OFFICE

        They enter a long dark hallway.  They suddenly find
        themselves standing in front of Lydia's room.  Adam/
        Monster looks at Barbara/Monster as he grabs the door-
        knob.  She stops him.  Tears fall down her sad ghostly
        face.

                                BARBARA
                  Adam.  I can't do it.  I like that
                  little girl.

                                ADAM/MONSTER
                  It's too late.  Sometimes things
                  just work out this way.  We have
                  to, honey.

                                BARBARA/MONSTER
                  No we don't.  We can rebel or
                  something.  We'll just stay up
                  there in our room.  I'll read, you
                  can build on the model.  Come on.

        She rushes up the stairs, toward the attic.  He follows
        her.

                                ADAM/MONSTER
                  Wait.  We can't, honey.  Our
                  house...

        She gets to the door.  Grabs the handle.

                                BARBARA
                  I want to be with Lydia!

        She throws open the door.


        INT. ATTIC - DAY

        Lydia is standing over the model, about to say
        Betelgeuse's name.

                                LYDIA
                  Okay.  Beetle... J...

        Barbara/Monster, horrified, screams!

                                BARBARA/MONSTER
                  <u<no< u="">!  Lydia, stop!

        Adam/Monster runs to grab her.  Lydia is terrified.
        Screams.

                                ADAM/MONSTER
                  No, don't say it!

                                BETELGEUSE
                  <u>Say it!  Rat shit</u>!

        Betelgeuse slips off the roof into a patch of thorny
        bushes.


        INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

        Lydia screams, Adam/Monster tries to calm her.  Lydia
        struggles and, thinking she is being attacked, runs out
        the door.  Smack into Barbara/Monster.

        Barbara catches her, frightens Lydia even more.
        Barbara holds onto her as she struggles.  Barbara/
        Monster slowly changes back into regular Barbara.
        Lydia sees who it is and she hugs her.  Like mother and
        daughter.

        ON ADAM - slowly returning to himself.  He smiles
        slightly at the scene.

                                BETELGEUSE (O.S.)
                  You lily-livered bleeding hearts!

                                BARBARA
                  I'm so sorry we frightened you.
                  What were you doing?

                                LYDIA
                  He... Beetle Jui...

        Barbara quickly puts her hand over her mouth.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  He said if I let him out he would
                  take me over to the other side to
                  find you.

                                BARBARA
                  No, Lydia, we're dead.

                                LYDIA
                  I want to be dead, too.

                                BARBARA
                         (shocked)
                  No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?

                                LYDIA
                         (after a pause,
                          dramatically
                          but for real)
                  Life is just... unliveable...

        Barbara hugs her.  She fumbles for words.  This is an
        unusual situation, a dead person talking a live person
        out of killing herself.  She rocks Lydia a little.
        Barbara looks at Adam.

                                BARBARA
                  Lydia, believe me... we know...
                  all the hard stuff is the same
                  over here.  You're going to be who
                  you are... whether you're alive or
                  dead... and over here -- it's...
                  It's flat... there's no food, no
                  colors... you can't smell the
                  flowers.
                         (thinking)
                  If we knew then what we know
                  now... we'd have been more
                  careful...

                                ADAM
                         (in the style of the
                          dead receptionist)
                  ... we wouldn't have had our
                  little accident.

        Lydia looks at Barbara lovingly.

                                BARBARA
                  So <u>never</u> let Beetlejuice out --
                  never.  Besides...
                         (looking at Adam)
                  We're thinking about letting
                  everyone stay... you and your
                  father and mother can stay too.

                                LYDIA
                         (smiles and says
                          slowly)
                  Step... mother.


        ADAM/MONSTER

        is not sure, huffs around a little.  He is trying to
        change back into Adam, except for his nose, which
        remains like a beak for a minute.  Finally, it changes
        too.

        Lydia and Barbara laugh at him.


        ANGLE

        Without noticing Lydia, Otho and Charles push in
        through the door and grab the model.  They take it out
        the door.

        Adam is beside himself.  Doesn't know what to do.

        Barbara stops him from taking action.

                                ADAM
                  What is going on?

                                LYDIA
                  Really.  I don't know.

        Adam looks suspiciously at her.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  I really don't.  I'll go find out.

        She runs out the door.

                                BARBARA
                  Be careful.


        INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

        Lydia runs through the hallway and into the dining
        room.


        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        Lydia walks into a presentation in progress.  Sitting
        around the table are Otho, Maxie, and Delia.  Sarah Dean
        is there, too.  She looks around Lydia hoping for
        ghosts.  Sarah is heavily made up, smells bad.

        Lydia's photos of the sheeted ghosts are blown up and
        standing on a nearby easel.  Charles, over the model
        with a pointer, is lost in mid-sentence.

                                CHARLES
                  -- In short, I've got options to
                  buy enough of Main Street to
                  control the city council for a
                  hundred years.  And at the prices
                  I'm talking about, if it all fell
                  apart tomorrow, we just move out and
                  sell to the Arabs and we still come
                  out... I've talked to Ed Cornwall
                  about a wax museum, here... in
                  Thanksgiving Park... Ed's the man
                  who made the talking Jesse Jackson
                  statue.
                  And I've got a museum dedicated to
                  50 Great Moments in the Paranormal
                  -- and parenthetically, D-Con wants
                  to the right to start an insect zoo
                  here in the old hardware store.
                         (seeing Lydia)
                  Lydia, did you finally decide to
                  join us?

        They all give her an oily smile.

                                CHARLES
                  Honey, I am just finishing the first
                  phase presentation about our little
                  project here.  Then we'll take a
                  stretch and invite <u>our</u> friends... to meet
                  <u>your</u> friends.

        Sarah gets Maxie's attention and unable to contain her
        excitement, silently urges him to get on with the
        ghosts.

                                SARAH
                  Are they here yet?

                                MAXIE
                  Yes, Charles, let's cut the
                  bullcorn.  We're here to see
                  ghosts.  This whole ghost town
                  museum and such like follows a
                  train, if you've got the engine...
                  so let's see your goddamned engine.

        Everyone looks at Lydia.

                                LYDIA
                  They're... not here anymore.

                                CHARLES
                         (smiling apologetically)
                  Nonsense, every time she says
                  that, the paint peels, and some
                  wild creature tries to kill us.

                                SARAH
                         (motioning)
                  We've got these pictures, Lydia.

                                LYDIA
                  No, really... they said they might
                  come back and all of us could live
                  in peace if you agreed not to
                  tease them or make them do silly
                  tricks.

        Sarah is disappointed.  She goes to Maxie.  Delia takes
        over.

                                DELIA
                  She's become a little emotional
                  about all this.  No counseling up
                  here.  But we aren't relying on
                  her.  No, we rely on
                  professionals.  We have... Otho.

        The whole room turns to Otho.  Who is scribbling some-
        thing and mumbling.

                                CHARLES
                  Are they still here, Otho?

        Otho looks up; he missed the question.

                                DELIA
                  Are they still here, Otho?

                                OTHO
                  Oh, they're still here.  They're
                  just not showing up.

                                CHARLES
                  They're probably guilty about what
                  they did to me.

                                DELIA
                  Not these people!  They are
                  ruthless!

                                MAXIE
                  I don't care from guilt.  I just
                  want to <u>see</u> them.

                                CHARLES
                  Otho, can you do it?

                                OTHO
                  It's tricky, but I think I can
                  handle it.

        He dramatically produces the handbook.

                                LYDIA
                  <u>No</u>!

        Lydia begins to think about this scene and she shifts
        to another point of view.

                                LYDIA
                  Wait a minute!  What am I worried
                  about?  Otho, you can't even
                  change a tire!

                                OTHO
                         (taking the challenge)
                  I'll need something personal of
                  theirs.

                                LYDIA
                  You'll have to go to the Goodwill.

        Delia gets an idea.


        EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

        The moon stares down icily through gray clouds.  Wind
        up.


        INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

        Barbara is looking out the window.

                                BARBARA
                         (wistful)
                  You know, I've been thinking.  I
                  could teach Lydia to sew.

                                ADAM
                  Little black party dresses?

                                BARBARA
                         (punching him playfully)
                  Ah, Adam, you don't know anything
                  about little girls.  She's just...
                  missed out on some love, that's
                  all...

                                ADAM
                         (huffy)
                  Let's see if she can get my model
                  back.

                                BARBARA
                  You can build another one... with
                  her.

        Adam isn't convinced.  Barbara motions him to sit next
        to her.

                                BARBARA
                         (continuing)
                  Come here, I want to talk to you.


        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        Delia carefully brings out a big plastic bag.  Lays
        something out on the dining room table.

                                DELIA
                  I'm deeply sentimental about...
                  weddings.

        Lydia stands to see:  Delia carefully lays out
        Barbara's white wedding dress.  Then next to it, Adam's
        wedding tux.

        Lydia looks at it.  A chill runs through her.

                                LYDIA
                         (hushed realization)
                  Their wedding clothes.

                                OTHO
                         (dramatically)
                  Their wedding clothes.

        Otho then holds up the handbook.

                                SARAH
                  The "words".

        Otho nods.


        INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        Lydia is nervous now.  Otho lights a candle and Delia
        turns out the lights.

                                OTHO
                  Hands vermillion / start of five
                  bright cotillion / raven's dive
                  nightshades promise / spirit's strive,
                  to the living / let now the dead...
                  come <u>alive</u>.

        Nothing happens.  Lydia nervously turns away.

                                LYDIA
                         (sarcastically)
                  Doo wah.


        ANGLE

        Then a SIZZLE, a TINY CRACKLE, along one side of the
        square.


        INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

        Barbara with her arm on his shoulder, talks to Adam.

                                BARBARA
                  We've been given a gift here,
                  honey.  A real live little girl.
                  She likes us a lot.  She needs
                  us.  Maybe that's why we died so
                  young, to keep us from getting
                  so... attached to <u>things</u>.  The
                  house, antiques, your model.  Look
                  at us.  We didn't have room for
                  anyone.

                                ADAM
                         (after a long thought)
                  What makes you think she likes me?

        Barbara slowly smiles.  He does too.

        He turns to Barbara.  CAMERA HINGES WITH him to see --


        ON BARBARA

        Her face is frightened.  She cannot speak.  She reaches
        out to him -- but is disappearing.  He reaches for her
        but she is suddenly -- GONE.


        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        Varicolored lightning bolts shoot from every corner of
        the square.  A gasp from everyone but Lydia.


        ON LYDIA -- she is looking away.  She turns to see:


        ON THE DRESS

        Barbara's wedding dress floats over the table and fills
        slowly, painfully, with the arms, legs and finally the
        frightened face of Barbara.  A lightning bolt flares.

        Lydia rises slowly to her feet, unable to resist.

        More lightning bolts.

                                OTHO
                  As sudden thunder / Pierces the night;
                  As magic wonder / Mad affright
                  Rives asunder / Man's delight:
                  Our ghost, our corpse and we
                  Rise to be.

        Lydia walks slowly toward Barbara.


        ON BARBARA

        She is in pain, she is very slowly aging.  She speaks,
        but no words can be heard.  Not even by Lydia.  But we
        can see she is calling for... Adam.

                                LYDIA
                  Stop it!

                                MAXIE
                  Shhhh!

        Lydia screams for Adam.

                                LYDIA
                  <u>Adam</u>.  <u>Adam</u>.

                                OTHO
                         (louder)
                  As flies the lizard / Serpent fell;
                  As goblin vizard, / At the spell
                  Of pale wizard, / Sinks to hell;
                  The buried, dead, and slain...
                  Rise again.


        INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

        In a lightning flare we see: Adam searching for
        Barbara.  He rushes out into the hallway.

                                ADAM
                  Barbara!  Barbara?  Ba...

        His last plaintive call becomes mute as he too begins
        slowly to disappear.


        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        On each of the watchers one by one, scared but
        delighted too.  No one is watching Lydia.

        ON LYDIA -- tears well up in her eyes.


        ON BARBARA

        She is slowly aging.  Now a bewildered Adam appears,
        floating in his wedding suit.  Seeing his Barbara, now
        older than he is, Adam reaches for her hand...

        ON HANDS -- as he grasps her hand, it seems to be made
        of white crepe; it wrinkles and nearly collapses.

        Adam... puzzled, calls her name silently.

                                DELIA
                  What's happening to them?

                                OTHO
                  I don't know.

                                CHARLES
                  Are they suffering?

                                LYDIA
                         (screams)
                  They're dying.

                                MAXIE
                  They're already dead.  They can't
                  feel a thing.

        Obviously not true.

        ON BARBARA -- she looks down slowly at Lydia and with
        effort makes a loving smile.  She reaches out toward
        Lydia.

        Completely helpless now, Lydia weeps openly and then
        something comes over her.  She rushes across the room.
        Stares down at the model.

                                LYDIA
                  Where <u>are you</u>?  Help us!  Please.
                  Betelgeuse!

        A CRACK OF LIGHTNING.


        EXT. MODEL TOWN GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

        Someone, or something, like the figure of death in the
        Goya drawing, is perched atop the gravestone of Barbara
        and Adam Maitland.  The graves beneath him are open.
        The figure turns... it is Betelgeuse.  He is filing his
        talons casually.

        He speaks with a ghastly rasp.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  So... You're ready for me now?

                                LYDIA
                  You've got to help them.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Can <u>you</u> help <u>me</u>?

                                LYDIA
                         (frightened)
                  ... I will.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Then <u>I'll</u> help them.  For a price.

        He grins.

                                LYDIA
                  W... What is it?

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (his words echo
                          horribly
                  Be... my... <u>queen</u>!

                                LYDIA
                         (repulsed)
                  Your qu...?  But you're...

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (smiling devilishly)
                  I'm beeyoo-teeful.


        ON LYDIA

        She is chilled.  Steps back.
        She turns back to the Maitlands who are continuing to
        age.  Looks back to the model.

                                LYDIA
                  ... All right... Betelgeuse...


        ON BETELGEUSE

        He doubles in size.  The tombstone crumbles beneath
        him...

                                LYDIA (V.O.)
                         (louder)
                  Betelgeuse...


        WIDER ON GRAVEYARD

        He doubles in size again.


        ON LYDIA

        She hesitates.


        ON BETELGEUSE - TIGHT

        He looks up at her confidently.

                                LYDIA
                  <u>Betelgeuse</u>!


        DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        Barbara and Adam's corpses are nearly at the end of
        their ropes.

                                CHARLES
                  All right, that's enough.  Can you
                  stop this now?

        Otho doesn't answer.

                                CHARLES
                         (continuing)
                  Otho?

                                OTHO
                  It's too late, Charles.  I'm
                  sorry.


        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        Lydia peers at the model.  Betelgeuse is transforming.
        There's a LOW RUMBLE.  The model town starts to shake.


        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        Lydia backs away.  Betelgeuse's head, now human-size,
        rises from the center of the model town.


        TIGHT ON HIS FACE

        His grin is malevolent and malicious.  It's showtime,
        folks!

                                BETELGEUSE
                  <u>Attention, K-Mart shoppers</u>!


        ON DEETZES

        -- who have been focused on the Maitlands now turning
        around to the model.


        ON MODEL

        Betelgeuse begins a bright but sinister Carnival
        Barker's pitch.  His shoulders now are clearing the
        model.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Welcome to <u>Winter River</u>!


        ANGLE

        Sarah rushes over to the model, thinking this is more
        of the show.  Maxie follows.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Hel <u>LO</u> Piggies!  <u>Welcome to Winter</u>
                  <u>River</u>!  See the Museum of Natural
                  Greed.  The Monument to Bored
                  Businessmen!  <u>Come closer</u>!


        ANGLE

        Suddenly Betelgeuse's arms elongate, swell and CRACKLE.


        ON MAXIE AND SARAH

        Their eyes grow wide.


        TIGHT ON BETELGEUSE'S HANDS

        They split, unfurl, and transmutate into two, shiny,
        huge sledgehammers.


        ON BETELGEUSE

        He grins, his eyes sparkle in anticipation.  CARNEY
        MUSIC UP.

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (roughly to the tune
                          of "Santa Claus is
                          Coming to Town")
                  You better not sell, you better
                  not buy...


        ON MAXIE AND SARAH

        Behind each of them, a graduated CARNIVAL BELL RINGING
        GAME STANDARD erects itself.


        ON BETELGEUSE

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (still singing)
                  Or old Uncle Beetle Claus will be
                  makin'... you... fly.

        Betelgeuse swings his hammer/hands and sends Max and
        Sarah zooming through the roof.  GONG.  GONG.


        ANGLE

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (in style of game
                          show host)
                  Yowser, yowser.  Well, who do we
                  have here tonight?


        ANGLE

        He looks up at the suspended Maitlands.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Let's have a hand for the
                  <u>Maitlands</u>, Barbara and Adam.  They
                  deserve a rest.


        ON MAITLANDS

        Wispy shadows by now, but still alive/dead.  They fall
        in a heap on the floor.  NOTE:  They immediately start
        to regenerate themselves.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Well, we'll get back to them after
                  they recover from their flight.


        ON ADAM

        Filling out again, he struggles to stand, but falls.
        Barbara shakes her head, trying to regain her focus.

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (looking around)
                  <u>My God</u>, what <u>ugly</u> wall dressing.
                  Who is responsible for all this
                  <u>ugliness</u>?
                         (spying Otho trying
                          to hide)
                  <u>Otho, it's you</u>!  Watch out for the
                  taste patrol!


        ANGLE

        He waves and the door opens.  A little Italian gentle-
        man appears.

                                OTHO
                  No.  Noooo!  My <u>God</u>.  It's <u>Giorgio</u>
                  <u>Armani</u>!

                                GIORGIO
                  Before youa getta started herea, I
                  joost wanta to saya, Otho,
                  don'ta weara my stuff?  Okay?
                  Youa too fat for human-type
                  clothes.  Ita makes my designs
                  looka like aircraft covering!


        ANGLE

        Otho is horrified.  Suddenly he looks down and sees his
        clothing has transformed into a polyester nightmare.
        He runs out the door screaming.  Betelgeuese laughs
        with delight then focuses on Lydia.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  Let's leave this crazy world
                  behind us.  I'll take you out in
                  style!

        Sound of eerie WEDDING MARCH.  The fireplace changes
        into an expressionist altar.


        ANGLE

        His leering horned whores walk like bridesmaids, in
        step, through the door.  They rush toward Lydia.


        ANGLE

        Frightened, Lydia is assaulted and pulled forward by
        these ugly handmaidens; she suddenly looks down and
        sees she is now clothed in a blood-red wedding dress.
        Lydia screams!!

                                BARBARA
                  No... <u>No</u>!

        Adam's eyes widen.

                                LYDIA
                         (frightened, but
                          hurling the incan-
                          tation to make him
                          disappear)
                  No... Betelgeuse.  Bet...

        Betelgeuse waves a hand and Lydia's mouth freezes.
        Delia and Charles plead with the recovering Maitlands.

                                DELIA
                         (frantic)
                  Please, can't you <u>do something</u>!
                  <u>Please</u>!



        ON BARBARA AND ADAM

        Adam, not fully recovered, heroically tries to speak --
        but his jaw falls off.  An exhausted Barbara tries to
        help him reattach it.

        Betelgeuse looks at Lydia.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  You know if we're going to get
                  married, we're going to need
                  <u>witnesses</u>!

        Betelgeuse shifts his glare to Charles and Delia.
        From Behind, Delia's horrid sculptures come to life
        and attack Charles and Delia.  The sculptures twist
        around them, forcing them to watch the hideous
        spectacle.

        Adam and Barbara are rapidly trying to recover as the
        ceremony begins.


        A DEATH-MASKED OLD PREACHER

        slides down the fireplace, ready to perform the
        service, speaks with a hissing death rattle.

                                PREACHER
                  Do you, Betel...

        His mouth drops and is frozen.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  <u>Uh-uh</u>!  No one says the B word!

                                PREACHER
                  Do you, _____________, take this
                  woman to be your wedded wife?  To
                  honor...

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (interrupting)
                  You betcha!

        Lydia screams and struggles.

                                PREACHER
                  And... you?  Do you, Lydia, take
                  this man?... er, uh... man... to
                  be your lawful wedded husband?...
                  In sickness...

        Lydia struggles.  Her screams are muffled and distant.
        Betelgeuse grabs her and shakes her.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  You don't have to answer him,
                  snookums.  I'll do it for you.
                         (eerily, speaking in
                          her voice)
                  I'm Lydia Deetz and I'm of sound
                  mind.  The man next to me is the
                  one I want.  You asked me... I'm
                  answering.  Yes.  How I love that
                  man of mine.

        Adam, now fully regenerated, moves toward them.  He
        shouts the incantation.

                                ADAM
                  Beetle...


        ANGLE

        Betelgeuse turns to him and with a sweep of his hand,
        Adam's teeth (as if they were false), fly out of his
        mouth and CLATTER to the floor.  Adam, toothless,
        musters up his ghost powers and --

        ON TEETH - TIGHT -- they rare back and continue
        shouting...

                                TEETH
                  Beetleju...


        ANGLE

        Mayhem breaks out.  A furious Betelgeuse stomps at them
        with his feet.  The teeth scuttle under the model.

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (angrily, to old man)
                  Now <u>move it</u>, pops!


        ON ADAM

        Speechless, Adam heroically charges toward Betelgeuse,
        ready to strike him.  Betelgeuse spins on him and waves
        his hand.  SOUND OF RUSHING WIND.


        ON ADAM

        He has been zapped into his model town.


        ANGLE

        Barbara screams and jumps at Betelgeuse.

                                BARBARA
                  Beetlegeuse...

        Betelgeuse turns on her, eyes flashing.


        ON BARBARA

        A gag comes over her mouth.


        ON MODEL

        Adam is running around the streets trying to get out of
        the model.  He looks up into the sky, sees a red glow
        and THUNDERING WEDDING MUSIC.  He doesn't know what to
        do.


        ON BARBARA

        She tears away her face (like tissue) and tries to say
        his name again...

                                BARBARA
                  Betelgeuse...


        ON BETELGEUSE

        More angry, he waves his hand.


        ON BARBARA

        Her lips are zippered shut.


        IN MODEL

        Desperate, Adam gets an idea.  He runs over to the
        truck Betelgeuse had crashed earlier, jumps in and
        tries to start it.


        ON BARBARA

        She unzips her mouth and tries again.

                                BARBARA
                  Be


        ON BETELGEUSE

        Fire darts from his eyes....


        ON BARBARA

        A chromium steel plate is riveted across her mouth.
        She screams wordlessly behind it.


        IN MODEL

        Adam finally gets the truck started.


        BARBARA

        Struggling with her mouth, frustrated to the breaking
        point, she looks all around the room and rushes to the
        window and CRASHES through into the night.


        IN MODEL

        Adam sees Barbara rush out.  He looks back at
        Betelgeuse, floors the gas pedal and goes for one last
        shot.


        BETELGEUSE

                                BETELGEUSE
                         (angry)
                  Now, let's get <u>rolling</u>!

                                PREACHER
                  Then, by the authority vested in
                  me by...

        A RUMBLE comes from outside.  Everyone notices but the
        Preacher.  He stutters to finish the wedding.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  By <u>me</u>!  Get <u>on</u> with it!

        LOUDER NOISE from outside.  Now nearly DEAFENING.

                                PREACHER
                  Yes... by him.  I now pronounce
                  you man and...


        ANGLE

        The truck is racing up to Betelgeuse's foot.  Adam
        bails out just in time as the truck hits Betelgeuse's
        foot and EXPLODES, giving him a distracting hot foot,
        then --


        ON WINDOW

        Through it -- amidst a cloud of yellow dust -- CRASHES
        the sand worm.  Barbara rides him bareback.  Barbara
        struggles to control the ROARING worm.  She pulls on
        his ears and looks around for Beetle Juice.  Seeing
        him, she spurs the Worm after Beetle Juice.


        ANGLE

        Beetle Juice struggles, trying to run from the worm.
        But Barbara and the worm outmaneuver him, corner him,
        and when the worm reaches him, he opens his hungry
        mouth and gulps Betelgeuse in one mouthful.

                                BETELGEUSE
                  <u>Rrrrat shit</u>!


        ANGLE

        Barbara leaps off, as the Sand Worm continues down
        through the floorboards of the house

        Betelgeuse is gone.  Adam is back to full size.
        Charles and Delia are no longer held by the sculptures.
        Lydia runs back to her family and Adam and Barbara.
        The dust settles.


        ON HOLE - JUNO

        peers into the room.  She pulls the whores through the
        hole.

                                                   FADE OUT.

        FADE IN:

        EXT. MAIN STREET - WINTER RIVER - A BRIGHT DAY

        BIRDS SING.  Ernie polishes the lion.  Old Bill sleeps.
        People stroll.


        EXT. MISS SHANNON'S BOARDING SCHOOL - DAY

        A lovely white boarding school with long, green lawn.
        A BELL RINGS.  Girls come out the front door.  Say
        goodbyes.  Lydia walks out too, carrying books.

                                LYDIA
                  'Bye, Serena.  See you later.

        Lydia walks along Main Street of Winter River.


        EXT. JANE BUTTERFIELD'S ANTIQUES/TRAVEL/REAL ESTATE

        Jane is getting out of her car -- Little Jane follows.

                                JANE
                  Hellooo!  How's school?

                                LYDIA
                         (not particularly
                          interested)
                  It's okay.  How's the dirt
                  business?

                                JANE
                  Well, I'm expecting a call from
                  your parents.  I have some news
                  for them.

        Jane hears PHONE RING from inside, rushes in to answer it.

                                LYDIA
                  Tell them I'll call them tonight.


        EXT. MAIN STREET - WINTER RIVER - A BRIGHT DAY

        Ernie polishes the lion.  Lydia passes.

                                LYDIA
                  Don't forget the balls, Ernie.

        He looks around, surprised.


        INT. JANE BUTTERFIELD'S ANTIQUES/TRAVEL/REAL ESTATE

        Jane screams into the phone.

                                JANE
                  What do you mean <u>no</u>?  After all
                  I've done for you.  I don't do
                  this for my health you know.

        CAMERA EXPLORES a row of photographs of houses for
        sale.

        ON PHOTOGRAPH -- of the old Maitland house.  It is
        delapidated and haunted-looking.  A legend reads:
        Fixer-Upper's Special."

        BACK TO JANE -- she is frustrated.

                                JANE
                  I have here a bona fide offer of
                  $250,000.00 for that dump.

        Little Jane is now at the Xerox machine.  The NOISE
        irritates Big Jane and she throws a wad of paper at
        Little Jane.  Little Jane gets mad and throws her
        papers into the air and exits.


        INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY

        We recognize the furniture.  It's the Deetzes'.  Delia
        is on the phone to Jane.  Charles comes in with the
        Wall Street Journal.  He fidgets, taps his fingers, as
        he reads and pours coffee -- all at once.

                                DELIA
                         (whisper to Charles)
                  It's Mrs. Butterworth again.

        Charles picks up the extension.

                                CHARLES
                  Listen to me, Jane.  We don't want
                  anyone <u>looking</u> at the house.  We
                  don't want it <u>painted</u>, the <u>yard</u>
                  <u>mowed</u>, the <u>trees trimmed</u>, nor do
                  we want it <u>termite</u> inspected.
                  It's <u>not for sale</u>.


        INT. JANE'S STORE - DAY

        Jane listens.  Silent.  Thinking.

                                JANE
                  Well.  Okay for now.  When <u>will</u>
                  you sell it?


        INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY

                                DELIA
                         (smiles)
                  Never, honey.  Never.

        She hangs up.  Looks at Charles.

                                DELIA
                         (continuing)
                  Some people never know when to
                  leave things the way they are.

        Charles smiles.


        INT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

        SOUND OF SWEEPING -- CAMERA eases up -- Barbara is
        sweeping.  Adam working on his model.

                                ADAM
                  What time is it?

                                BARBARA
                  3:30 I guess.

                                ADAM
                  Give or take a year.

        Barbara smiles.

        The KITCHEN DOOR SLAMS.  Barbara looks up at Adam.
        They smile.

                                ADAM
                  Did you get the paint?

                                LYDIA'S VOICE
                  I got it.  And I took pictures of
                  the new church for you, too.

                                BARBARA
                  How'd you do on the science test?

        ON LYDIA

                                LYDIA
                         (hangs her head)
                  It was gross.  They wanted me to
                  dissect a frog.  I told them no
                  way.  I said it was against my
                  religion.  I got a C.

        Adam frowns a little.

                                BARBARA
                  How did you do on the math test?

        Lydia looks down coyly.

                                ADAM
                  We studied all day yesterday.
                  Don't tell me...

                                LYDIA
                  I got an A!

        They grin with pride.

                                LYDIA
                         (continuing)
                  So can I?

                                ADAM
                         (shaking his head)
                  Uh-uh.  Only if you got <u>above</u> a C
                  on science.

                                LYDIA
                  Oh, go on...

                                BARBARA
                  Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You
                  never got an A in science in your
                  life!

                                ADAM
                  All right.

        ON LYDIA -- she puts down her books.  Loosens her
        collar, ruffles her hair and waits.

                                ADAM
                         (continuing)
                  Okay.

        Lydia looks down.  Lydia begins to levitate.

        She lifts her head and leaves the white bread world
        behind!  In a voice as deep and soulful as Percy
        Sledge:

                                LYDIA
                  "When a man loves a woman.
                  He can't keep his mind on nothin' else."

        Behind her ghostly images of the football players
        appear as back-up.

                                FOOTBALLERS
                  Oooooo.  Hummm <u>oooooo</u>.

                                LYDIA
                  He'd change the world for the good
                  thing he's found.  When a <u>main</u>
                  needs a woman, He cain't keep his
                  mind on nothin' else.  If she's
                  bad, he won't see it, she can do
                  no wrong.

        MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:


        ANGLE

        A great pile of sand with the whorehouse in the
        middle.  An irritated Betelgeuse crawls out on the
        roof.  Hating the singing he shakes his fist at the
        sky -- loses his footing and tumbles into the sand.
        Terrified, he scrambles to get out.


        ON PILE

        A moving coil under the sand sends him scurrying inside
        again.  The Sandworm SNAPPING right behind him as he
        runs back out on the roof.


        ANGLE

        CAMERA TILTS UP to see house.  It is the perfect, New
        England house.  CAMERA PULLS BACK from the model -- out
        the window of the real house.

        Outside the real house -- we see it is dilapidated, and
        undeniably, the perfect haunted house.

                                                   FADE OUT.
