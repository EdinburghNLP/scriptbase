CREDITS

Still-life tableaus. Lawford, N.H., a town of fifty buildings 
on a glacial ridge, neither mountain nor plateau. Developed 
as 1880's forestland, discarded in the Depression. Winter 
has set in. Halloween day. Snowy fields yield to overcast 
skies: oppressive, horizonless, flourescent.

-- Wickham's Restaurant. Where Route 29 bends. 24-hour diner. 
Margie Fogg works here.

-- Trailer park in shadow of Parker Mountain. Home of Wade 
Whitehouse.

-- Toby's Inn. Roadhouse three miles from town on the river 
side of Route 29. Everything not tied down ends up here.

-- Glen Whitehouse farm. White clapboard.

-- First Congregational Church. North on the Common from 
City Hall.

-- LaRiviere Co. Ramshackle well-digging firm embarrassingly 
near the town center. Wade works here.

-- Merritt's Shell Station. Cinder-block.

-- Alma Pittman's house. Like so many others.

-- Town Hall.

ROLFE WHITEHOUSE'S VOICE, thirtiesh, articulate, speaks over 
credit tableaus:

		ROLFE (V.O.)
	This is the story of my older 
	brother's strange criminal behavior 
	and disappearance. We who loved him 
	no longer speak of Wade. It's as if 
	he never existed. By telling his 
	story like this, as his brother, I 
	separate myself from his family and 
	those who loved him. Everything of 
	importance -- that is, everything 
	that gives rise to the telling of 
	this story -- occurred during a single 
	deer-hunting season in a small town 
	in upstate New Hampshire where Wade 
	was raised and so was I. One night 
	something changed and my relation to 
	Wade's story was different from what 
	it had been since childhood. I mark 
	this change by Wade's tone of voice 
	during a phone call two nights after 
	Halloween. Something I had not heard 
	before. Let us imagine that around 
	eight o'clock on Halloween Eve, 
	speeding past Toby's, Route 29, comes 
	a pale green eight-year-old Ford 
	Fairlane with a police bubble on 
	top. A square-faced man wearing a 
	trooper's cap is driving the vehicle. 
	Beside him sits a child, a little 
	girl with a plastic tiger mask 
	covering her face. The man is driving 
	fast --

-- Route 29 tableau dissolves to night. A pale green police 
Ford Fairlane drives past.

END CREDITS

INT./EXT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

WADE WHITEHOUSE, driving, sits beside JILL, his daughter, 
ten years-old, wearing a black-and-yellow tiger plastic mask.

		WADE
	I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I 
	couldn't help it it's too late to go 
	trick-or-treating now. I couldn't 
	help it I had to stop at Penny's for 
	the costume. And you were hungry, 
	remember.

		JILL
	Who's fault is it then if it's not 
	yours? You're the one in charge, 
	Daddy.

		WADE
		(shakes cigarette 
		from pack)
	Yeah.

		JILL
	Look. Those kids are still trick-or-
	treating. They're still out.

Wade watches boys in the headlights, lights cigarette.

		WADE
	Those are the Hoyts.

		JILL
	I don't care. They're out.

		WADE
	Can't you see... look out there. 
	Nobody's got their porch lights on 
	anymore. It's too late. Those Hoyt 
	kids are just out to get in trouble. 
	See, they put shaving cream all over 
	that mailbox there. They chopped 
	down Herb Crane's new bushes. Little 
	bastards. Jesus H. Christ.

Wade grimaces, holds his jaw. The Fairlane swerves around 
broken pumpkins under a caution light.

		JILL
	Why do they do that?

		WADE
	Do what?

		JILL
	You know.

		WADE
	Break stuff?

		JILL
	Yeah. It's stupid.

		WADE
	I guess they're stupid.

		JILL
	Did you do that when you were a kid?

		WADE
	Well, yeah. Sort of. Nothing really 
	mean. Me and my pals, me and my 
	brothers. It was kind of funny then. 
	Stealing pumpkins, soaping windows. 
	Stuff like that.

		JILL
	Was it funny?

		WADE
	To us it was.

		JILL
	But it's not funny now.

		WADE
	It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I 
	gotta listen to all the complaints 
	people make. I'm not a kid anymore. 
	You change.

		JILL
	I bet you did lots of bad things.

		WADE
	What are you talking about?

		JILL
	I just think you used to be bad.

		WADE
	No. I didn't used to be bad. No sir. 
	Where do you get this stuff? From 
	your mother?

		JILL
	No. She doesn't talk about you 
	anymore.

Wade looks at her, wanting to lift her mask, see her face.

						CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT

The Fairlane approaches Town Hall, a square two-story building 
on the north side of the Common. Exhaust billows from idling 
cars as parents and children come and go.

						CUT TO:

INT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT

Clowns, tramps, angels and vampires fill the brightly lit 
room. Parents watch from the walls as GORDON LARIVIERE, a 
beefy fiftiesh man with a silver flat-top, announces the 
costume contest. Wade nods to various townspeople.

		LARIVIERE
	We're looking for the funniest 
	costume! And the scariest! And the 
	most imaginative! And the best costume 
	of all!

		WADE
		(nudges Jill)
	Got here just in time. Go ahead. 
	Jump in line. Maybe you'll win a 
	prize.

Jill steps forward, retreats. Wade looks at her flaxen hair, 
her blue sneakers protruding from her pathetic costume. His 
heart aches he loves her so.

		WADE
	Go on, Jill. Some of those kids you 
	still know.

		JILL
	I don't want to.

		WADE
	Why? Why not? You know these kids 
	from when you went to school here. 
	It hasn't been that long.

		JILL
	It's not that.

		WADE
	What then?

		JILL
	It's stupid.

		WADE
	It's fun.

		JILL
		(voice breaking)
	I want to go home.
		(Wade kneels down)
	I don't like it here.

		WADE
	Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't 
	mess this up anymore than it's already 
	been messed up. Join the other kids. 
	Do that and before you know it you'll 
	be as happy as a goddamned clam.

Wade inches her toward the circle of children. Gordon spots 
them:

		LARIVIERE
	Wade! And who's that tiger? Is that 
	Jill? Come and join us.

Jill in the spotlight, joins the costumed children. A former 
classmate calls her name. Wade, relieved, watches, then steps 
outside for a smoke.

						CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT

Wade steps outside, lights a cigarette. JACK HEWITT, 23, 
clean-cut, handsome, cocky, stands with CHICK WARD and FRANKIE 
LACOY, local boys.

		WADE
	What are you boys up to?

		CHICK
	Same old shit.

		FRANKIE
	You see the damage these little sons-
	of bitches been raising tonight?

		WADE
		(to Jack)
	You're going to have to move your 
	pickup.

		JACK
	I know.

		CHICK
		(offers whiskey pint)
	Take a bite.

		WADE
	Don't mind if I do.

		JACK
	LaRiviere's having a hell of a time 
	in there. Master of fucking 
	ceremonies.

		WADE
	Where's that gun you were bragging 
	on today?

Jack stops over to his double-parked burgandy pickup, removes 
a Browning BAR .30/06 with a scope, hands it to Wade.

		JACK
	No brag. Just fact.

		WADE
		(admires gun)
	Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks?
		(passes it to Frankie)

		FRANKIE
	Nice.

		JACK
		(to Wade)
	See you got Jill tonight. How'd you 
	manage that?

		WADE
		(turns)
	Don't forget to move your truck.
		(walks inside)

						CUT TO:

INT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT

On stage, LaRiviere arranges the contest winners. A fairy 
godmother with a wand beams while, nearby, a hobo writhes in 
his mother's grip -- a hard loser.

Wade looks for Jill, first among the winners, then among the 
losers; she's nowhere to be found. He heads toward a hall 
leading to the restrooms.

Jill stands alone in the corner next to the pay phone, tiny, 
forlorn. Wade realizes at once he was wrong to leave her 
before she had found a friend.

		WADE
	Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight 
	of you. I had to step outside for a 
	smoke. You find anybody you know 
	here? There must be some kids you 
	used to know from school. You want 
	to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? 
	Be more fun than hanging out with me 
	all day.

		JILL
	No.

		WADE
	No what?

		JILL
		(lifts mask atop head)
	No I didn't see anybody I know. No I 
	don't want to go to school here 
	tomorrow. I want to go home.

		WADE
	You are home. There are lots of kids 
	you still know here.

		JILL
	I don't want to be here. Don't worry, 
	I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want 
	to go home.

		WADE
		(sighs)
	Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. 
	Tomorrow morning, you still want to 
	go home, I'll drive you down. I'll 
	get off work or something.

		JILL
		(pause)
	I called Mommy.

		WADE
	What? You called Mommy? Just now?

		JILL
	Yes.

		WADE
	Jesus, why?

		JILL
	I... because I want to go home. She 
	said she'd come and get me.

		WADE
	Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn 
	half hour drive each way. Why didn't 
	you talk to me about it first?

		JILL
	See, I knew you'd be mad.

		WADE
	Yeah. Yeah, right, I'm mad. What'd 
	you tell her, for Christ sake?

		JILL
	I told her I wanted to come home. 
	Daddy, don't be mad at me.

		WADE
	Well, I guess I am. I planned this, 
	I planned all this, you know. I mean, 
	it's sort of pathetic, but I planned 
	it. You shouldn't have called your 
	mother.
		(takes her arm)
	C'mon, we're gonna call her before 
	she leaves.

						CUT TO:

EXT. POLICE OFFICE - NIGHT

Wade leads her to a frosted-glass door reading "POLICE", 
enters. Inside, he flips on flourescent light, dials the 
desk phone. More utility room than office.

He waits. There's no answer. Jill looks down.

		WADE
	She's gone already!
		(hangs up)
	Gone already! Couldn't wait.

		JILL
	Yes.

		WADE
	That's all you got to say? "Yes".

		JILL
	Yes.

		WADE
	She won't be here for a half hour. 
	Think you can stand it that long?

		JILL
	Yes.

		WADE
	Where do you expect to wait for her? 
	Obviously downstairs with the other 
	kids isn't good enough.

Jill sits in a chair facing the dark window pane.

		WADE
	Sit right there by yourself if you 
	want. Wait for her by yourself. That's 
	fine with me. Just dandy. I'm going 
	downstairs.

		JILL
	That's fine with me too. When Mommy 
	comes, tell her I'm up here.

Wade Whitehouse stalks out.

						CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT

Wade steps outside, notices Jack Hewitt and his kewpie-doll 
girlfriend HETTIE, 20, sitting in the cab of his double-parked 
pickup, sharing a joint, talking to LaCoy alongside.

		WADE
	I thought I told you to move that 
	truck!

		JACK
	Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You 
	wanna toke?

		WADE
		(steps over)
	You gotta be more careful about that 
	shit. Gordon or one of those guys 
	sees you smoking that wacky tabacky 
	around me they'll expect me to bust 
	you. And I'll be outta a job.

		JACK
	Some job. Here, have a hit. Don't be 
	such a hardass. I know you got 
	problems, but everybody's got 
	problems.
		(offers joint)

		WADE
	Not here.

LaCoy laughs: that Jack Hewitt, some guy. Wade holds his 
aching jaw. He looks at Jack's young athletic body, his pretty 
girlfriend, envies him.

		JACK
	Well, c'mon, then. Get in and we'll 
	take a little ride, my man.

Wade looks up to the window where Jill waits, walks around 
the front of the truck, gets in.

						CUT TO:

INT./EXT. JACK'S TRUCK - NIGHT

Jack's high-bodied pickup growls in low gear as it drives 
past Merritt's Shell station toward Saddleback Ridge. Jack 
lowers the radio as Wade asks him about deer season; Hettie 
leans forward to hear the music.

		JACK
	Got a job first thing in the morning, 
	first day of season. Saturday I'll 
	hunt for myself. Twombley something. -
	Er --

		WADE
	Evan. He's a mucky-muck union official 
	from Massachusetts. You're lucky.

		JACK
	Don't know about lucky. The guy's a 
	full-blown asshole. Pay's good, 
	though. $100 a day. I got to guarantee 
	a kill, of course. Which I can do. 
	There's some monster bucks hiding 
	out up there.

		WADE
	How'd you get the job?

		JACK
	Gordon, he's always got some angle 
	working. He wants to keep Twombley 
	happy, I'm his boy.

Wade grimaces as he passes the joint back.

		HETTIE
	What's wrong with you?

		WADE
	Toothache.
		(to Jack)
	You should get close to him. Make 
	yourself irreplaceable. Guy's loaded.

		JACK
	Like you and Gordon?

		WADE
	Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get 
	along without me.

		JACK
		(laughs)
	Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you 
	quit him.

		WADE
		(laughs)
	Right!

A car flashes past.

		JACK
	Bastard's got his high beams on.

		WADE
		(watching)
	Shit.

		HETTIE
	What?

		WADE
	My ex-wife Lillian and her husband. 
	That was them in the Audi that just 
	passed us.

		JACK
	Audi's a good car.

		HETTIE
	What's she up here for?

		WADE
	Aw, shit, she's here to get Jill. Me 
	and Jill had a little argument. Jack, 
	I got to get back, get back to town. 
	Move this thing, will you? See if 
	you can get back to the Town Hall 
	before they get there, okay?

		JACK
	Piece of fucking cake.

Jack brakes, wheels the 4x4 around, heads back to town.

						CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT

Most parents have left or are leaving with their costumed 
children. Hewitt's burgundy pickup breaks alongside the Audi. 
Wade swings open the passenger door, jumps to the ground:

		WADE
	Lillian!

		LILLIAN
	Where's Jill?

LILLIAN, 40, attractive in an ankle-length hooded coat. 
Whatever pose Wade strikes, she strikes the opposite. Her 
dress and demeanor set her apart.

		WADE
	Me and Jill, we just had a little 
	spat. She felt kind of left out, I 
	guess, from not knowing some of the 
	new kids --

		LILLIAN
	Where is she now? Is she in the truck 
	with your friends?

Jack and Hettie neck inside the cab.

		WADE
	She told me she wanted to wait for 
	you. Inside.

Jill at the window in her tiger mask. Lillian waves; Jill 
motions she'll be down.

		LILLIAN
	While you went off for a few beers 
	with your friends? Is that Hettie 
	Rodgers there, with whatzizname?

		WADE
	Yeah.

		LILLIAN
	She's grown up some, hasn't she?

		WADE
	Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It 
	looks like you've won this fucking 
	round already, so lay off a little, 
	for Christ's sake.

HORNER, 45, Lillian's new husband, thin with thinning hair 
and a Tyrolean hat, sees Jill at the entrance and heads toward 
her.

		WADE
	Horner! Leave her be. This's got 
	nothing to do with you, so just act 
	like the chauffeur. Got it?

		HORNER
	Wade. Nobody wants any trouble.

Horner greets Jill, walks her to the silver Audi. Passing 
parents, listening, give Wade a wide berth.

		WADE
	I don't want her to go, Lillian.

		LILLIAN
	Don't cause a scene. No one's trying 
	to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it 
	any worse.

		WADE
	I'm not making it any worse. You 
	are. Me and Jill could've worked 
	this thing out. It's normal, it's 
	even normal for me to get a little 
	touchy about it. Believe it or not. 
	How do you think this makes me look, 
	treating her like some tragic victim 
	or something?

Horner opens the car door for Jill, shuts it. Wade shoves 
him:

		WADE
	Just wait till we're through, 
	goddamnit!

Horner's hat falls. Lillian, icy, stares at Wade. He backs 
off. Wade sometimes wonders: how'd Lillian Pittman of Lawford, 
N.H., get so much class?

		WADE
	Don't you say a word. I didn't hit 
	him. I'm not going to hit anybody.

Horner sits behind the wheel. Lillian silently stares Wade 
up and down, gets in the car beside Jill. The automatic locks 
latch as the Audi drives away. Its taillights merge with 
vanishing traffic.

Wade looks down, picks up Horner's dark green Tyrolean hat, 
examines it, as if unsure of its function.

Wade walks toward Town Hall. MARGIE FOGG, exiting, greets 
him:

		MARGIE
	New hat?
		(no answer)
	Jill's up, I see.

		WADE
		(vague)
	For a while.

		MARGIE
	How's she doing?

		WADE
	Okay. She's fine.

		MARGIE
	You two want to do anything tomorrow 
	and need a third party, give me a 
	call, okay? I'm off.

NICK WICKHAM, 45, Marg's boss, passes by:

		WICKHAM
	Like hell you are. Tomorrow's first 
	day of deer season. I'll need you at 
	least in the morning.

		MARGIE
		(shrugs)
	Well, that's that.

		NICK
		(walks off)
	Take care, Wade.

		WADE
	You be careful of that little bastard. 
	He's dying to get in your pants, you 
	know.

		MARGIE
		(laughs)
	Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. 
	I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.

		WADE
	See you tomorrow, maybe.

		MARGIE
	You okay?

		WADE
	Yeah.

Wade, lost in thought, continues toward Town Hall. At the 
door, LaRiviere, one of the last to leave, eyes him. Wade 
tosses Horner's hat inside.

		WADE
	Tomorrow, Gordon.

		LARIVIERE
	Watch this snow. It's coming down 
	tonight.

Wade nods as he lights a cigarette. Alone, he watches the 
last cars pull out. He holds his jaw.

						CUT TO:

EXT. WADE'S TRAILER HOME - DAWN

Pre-dawn light silhouettes a dozen weather-beaten mobile 
homes set off Route 29. Snow continues to fall. A sheet of 
white stretches down Parker mountain.

						CUT TO:

INT. WADE'S TRAILER - DAWN

6:40. A clock radio pierces the silence with classic rock. 
Wade Whitehouse rolls over, runs his tongue across mossy 
teeth, shuts off the music. He looks out the window, grunts: 
"Shit!" He steps over to the phone by the frayed plaid couch, 
dials.

Wade's trailer is surprisingly neat, considering its owner 
smokes too much, drinks too much, eats take-out and rarely 
cleans up.

		WADE
		(on phone)
	Lugene? Wade. Hoya doin?
		(fumbles for cigarette)
	Look, I was wondering, with the snow 
	and all, if you got school today?
		(lights cigarette)
	How the hell do I know? You're the 
	principal. All I'm supposed to do is 
	direct traffic from 7:30 to 8:30.
		(listens)
	Yeah, okay, I'm sorry -- I only just 
	now saw it was snowing, that's all. 
	My whole day is fucked. I gotta plow 
	all day. If I don't get over to 
	LaRiviere's early enough, I'm stuck 
	with the grader. I was just hoping 
	you'd have called school off.
		(beat)
	You check the weather bureau?
		(acquiesces)
	Okay, I hear you. I'll be over in a 
	bit.

EXT. WADE'S TRAILER HOME EARLY - MORNING

Jack Hewitt's 4x4 passes Wade's trailer, continues up 29. 
Tire chains splice the path.

						CUT TO:

EXT. JACK'S TRUCK EARLY - MORNING

Jack behind the wheel. Beside him EVAN TWOMBLEY, 60, fleshy, 
Irish, wearing brand new scarlet wool pants, jacket and cap. 
He feeds on the misfortunes of others.

		TWOMBLEY
	It's not enough snow, not for tracking 
	the bastards. No advantage there, 
	kid.

		JACK
	Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know 
	where those suckers are. Rain or 
	shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. 
	We'll kill us a buck today. 
	Guaranteed. Before ten.

		TWOMBLEY
	Guaranteed, eh?

		JACK
	Yep. Right about now the does are 
	holing up in the brush piles. The 
	bucks are right behind them and we're 
	right behind the bucks.
		(gestures to gun rack)
	This gun gets fired before ten 
	o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or 
	not is more less up to you. I'll put 
	you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck 
	the first four hours of the season. 
	That's what you're paying me for, 
	ain't it?

		TWOMBLEY
	Damn straight!

Hewitt looks at Twombley's rifle: a Winchester M-94 pump-
action, custom carved stock and not a scratch on it. Never 
fired, at least not by Twombley.

		JACK
	Done much shooting with that rifle 
	yet?

		TWOMBLEY
		(eyes him)
	Tell you what. You get me close to a 
	big buck by ten, kid, there's another 
	hundred bucks in it.

		JACK
	If you get it?

		TWOMBLEY
	Yeah.

		JACK
	You might not kill it.

		TWOMBLEY
	You think so.

		JACK
	You might gut-shoot it or cripple it 
	for somebody else to find and tag. 
	Can't guarantee that won't happen, 
	especially with a new gun. I may 
	have to shoot it.

		TWOMBLEY
	You take care of your end, kid, I'll 
	take care of mine.

		JACK
	Mmm.

		TWOMBLEY
	You understand what I'm saying? I 
	want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple 
	or whatthefuck.

		JACK
	I get it.
		(disdain)
	No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer 
	and you'll get him dead. And you'll 
	have him by coffee time.

		TWOMBLEY
	And you'll get your extra hundred 
	bucks.

		JACK
		(smiles)
	Wonderful!

The pickup disappears behind a curve of pine and spruce trees.

						CUT TO:

EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING

Wade Whitehouse, wearing a reflective vest, waves a district 
school bus into the parking lot. Noisy, jostling grade 
schoolers emerge from the bus. Jill's former classmates. 
Straight as a statue, Wade holds back traffic. Cars and trucks 
are backed up on the unplowed road. Horns honk and bleat; a 
woman's voice yells, "Whitehouse, we 'ain't got all day!"

Wade, daydreaming, seems oblivious to the commotion. Oblivious -- 
or just plum contrary.

A shiny black BMW approaches, speeding, passing traffic on 
the shoulder. A man and a woman in a fur coat sit in front, 
two children in back. Whitehouse waves for it to stop.

The BMW accelerates through the intersection, ignoring Wade 
and the traffic. It whizzes past, spinning Wade, and is 
quickly up the road, spewing ice and exhaust. Wade slips to 
one knee. Honking ensues; every car goes where it wishes.

Wade, brushing off snow, follows the last bus as it pulls 
in. LUGENE BROOKS, 60, school principal, rushes over:

		LUGENE
	Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? 
	Why were you holding everyone up?

		WADE
	Did you see that sonofabitch in the 
	BMW? He could've killed somebody.

		LUGENE
	Did you get his number?

		WADE
	I know who it is.

		LUGENE
	Good. Who?

		WADE
	Mel Gordon.

		LUGENE
	I still don't understand --

		WADE
	From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in-
	law -- he was driving. I know where 
	they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. 
	The old man's out deer hunting with 
	Jack Hewitt, so they probably got 
	some big weekend party planned.

Wade sets his face, thinking.

						CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Snowprints lead from Jack's pickup to where he and Twombley 
walk, guns pointed skyward. They enter a line of trees.

Jack watches Twombley walk ahead of him, wrapped like a huge 
infant in red bunting, crunching twigs underfoot. He looks 
from side to side, checks his gun, returns to watching 
Twombley. They're alone.

		JACK
	Safety on?

Twombley nods, slips, thumps to the ground. His rifle lands 
silently.

Jack sprints over, helps him up, safety latches the 
Winchester. Hands it back.

		TWOMBLEY
	I'm okay.

		JACK
	Follow close. We'll cross the next 
	meadow.

Jack finds a path, one eye on Twombley:

		JACK
	I used to play ball.

		TWOMBLEY
	Yeah?

		JACK
	Drafted by the Red Sox.

		TWOMBLEY
	You played for the Sox?

		JACK
	Double A. New Britain.

		TWOMBLEY
	Oh.

		JACK
	Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come 
	out of New Hampshire since Carlton 
	Fisk."

		TWOMBLEY
	Really.

		JACK
	They said.

		TWOMBLEY
	Hmm.

		JACK
	The only difference between me and 
	that Clemens on TV is luck, shit 
	luck.

		TWOMBLEY
	What happened?

		JACK
	Ruined my arm. Brought me along too 
	fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking 
	arm, I used to think. Then I realized 
	it had to be somebody's fucking arm.

Jack waits for Twombley as they enter a meadow. Jack aims 
his rifle at Twombley as he approaches.

		TWOMBLEY
	Hey, Hewitt! Slow the fuck down!

Jack aims away, following an imaginary bird. Twombley steps 
alongside.

		JACK
	Safety on?

		TWOMBLEY
	Yeah.

		JACK
	This way.

		TWOMBLEY
		(walking loudly)
	Sun's gettin high.

		JACK
		(fingers to lips)
	Deers have ears too.

						CUT TO:

EXT. LARIVIERE CO. - DAY

Milky sky flatters LaRiviere Co., a sprawl of well-digging, 
septic and snow plow equipment. Billboard declaimes: 
"LARIVIERE CO. -- OUR BUSINESS IS GOING IN THE HOLE!" a motto 
repeated on every truck and piece of equipment. Wade's green 
Fairlane is parked outside the office.

						CUT TO:

INT. LARIVIERE CO. - DAY

Wade, puffing a cigarette, passes ELAINE'S (LaRiviere 
secretary) desk, her large red "No Smoking" sign, eases into 
an office modum chair. He unzips his jacket, slaps his cap 
against his thigh, spraying drops of melted snow.

Gordon LaRiviere, speaking on the phone past a glass 
partition, calls to Wade:

		LARIVIERE
	Told you the snow was coming down. 
	Take the grader.

		WADE
	Where's the plow?

		LARIVIERE
	Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting 
	with Evan Twombley.

		WADE
	His son-in-law damn near killed me.

		LARIVIERE
		(hangs up)
	Huh?

		WADE
	At the school crossing. In his BMW. 
	Coulda hurt some kids. I'm gonna 
	bust his ass.

		LARIVIERE
	Don't go playing policeman.

		WADE
	What am I -- a security guard? You 
	hired me, you and your Selectman 
	friends.

		LARIVIERE
	You don't want the extra police pay?

		WADE
	I'm not saying that.

		LARIVIERE
	Get the grader. Go out 29 past Toby's. 
	Don't let Lillian get to you. She 
	didn't belong here. That's why she 
	left.

		WADE
	Fuck you.

		LARIVIERE
	That's what I love about a small 
	town. You know everybody.

Wade exits toward the blue grader.

						CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Jack and Twombley walk through fresh snow. The hillside's 
thick with pine trees. Twombley, red-faced, puffing, leans 
to speak to Hewitt. Jack lifts a finger to his lips:

		JACK
	Stay here, stand where I am.

Twombley peers over a slight cliff at a lumber trail twenty 
feet below. Jack points:

		JACK
	Fresh tracks.
		(sniffs)
	Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, 
	Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.

		TWOMBLEY
	You only got a little while if you 
	want your hundred bucks.

Jack zig-zags down the incline, while Twombley, gun poised, 
waddles along the edge.

Jack stops fifty feet away, watches Twombley, a cartoon 
character. A stag pokes his nose through the pines, steps 
into a clearing. Jack aims his rifle, looks at Twombley.

Twombley turns to see the buck, loses his footing, TUMBLES 
down the twenty-foot cliff.

						CUT TO:

EXT. TOBY'S INN - DAY

An open cab grader ("Our Business Is Going In The Hole") 
sits in the rutted lot outside Toby's, a beer joint with 
fake wood siding and 24-hour neon sign.

A four-wheel drive plow with the LaRiviere motto pulls in, 
parks beside the blue grader. JIMMY DAME, 40, gets out, 
glances at the grader as he enters.

						CUT TO:

INT. TOBY'S INN - DAY

Jimmy joins Wade at the bar, calls for a beer. Frankie LaCoy 
bullshits with two long-haired locals at a nearby table; 
their conversation drifts in and out. Country music plays 
through a broken juke box speaker. Wade touches his tooth, 
grimaces.

		JIMMY
	How's it goin?

		WADE
	Cold. How you think?

		JIMMY
	Sorry about that. Why's it every 
	year, come first snow, you get stuck 
	with the grader?

		WADE
	School. Traffic crossing.
		(lights cigarette)
	I gotta quit these things.

		JIMMY
	What we doing after? Wells?
		(Wade nods)
	Don't work too fast. Business the 
	way it is, Gordon's probably looking 
	to lay me off earlier than usual 
	this year. He's got too much money 
	as it is. Why's it always the little 
	guy that gets kicked in the butt in 
	hard times?

Wade shrugs. LaCoy's conversation has caught his ear. He 
turns to watch.

		LACOY
	...That was no pisser. I'll tell you 
	who was a pisser. Glen Whitehouse. 
	There was a real pisser. He was mean 
	normal, but when he drank it was 
	like he burst on fire. Canadian Club. 
	Always drank CC. One Christmas there's 
	this cord of wood out back he forgot 
	about and he decides to have his two 
	boys stack it. Except it's been out 
	back two months and it's snowed and 
	rained and froze so now the wood's 
	all iced in. He takes the boys. He 
	was drunk, of course.

Wade's face as the story comes to life:

						CUT TO:

EXT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY (1964)

Thirty years before. GLEN WHITEHOUSE ("POP"), 42, pushes his 
boys, Wade (13) and Rolfe (10), toward snow-covered lumps of 
firewood behind the barn. He's drunk. The boys carry shovels 
and a pickaxe.

		POP
	Move it! Daylight in the swamps!

		ROLFE
	Pop, the kids are waiting for us.

		WADE
		(reproving)
	Rolfe.

		POP
	A lesson in work and its rewards. 
	You'll thank me for this one day.
		(to house)
	Sally, turn off that TV!

His sons chip at the wood. Hopeless. Frozen solid.

		WADE
		(to Rolfe)
	Just do it.

		POP
	Atta-go.

		ROLFE
	Please, Pop. Let's go back.

Wade notices his mother, SALLY, watching from the window.

		POP
	What are you, a quitter?

						CUT TO:

INT. TOBY'S INN - DAY

LaCoy roars with laughter.

		LONG-HAIRED LOCAL
		(puzzled)
	So what happened?

		LACOY
	Beats me. That's all I heard. Wade 
	would know more about it.
		(calls)
	Wade! We were just talking about 
	your Old Man. "What are you, a 
	quitter!"

Wade grabs his keys, walks over. Jimmy follows.

		WADE
	Jesus, LaCoy, you got nothing better 
	to do than sit around and tell 
	stories. Pity is, some college student 
	will come some day and believe this 
	shit cause you're the only one dumb 
	enough to talk to him. Take care.

Wade and Jimmy head out.

						CUT TO:

EXT. BACKROAD - DAY

Wade, shivering in the open grader, plows a narrow winding 
road. He lights a cigarette, exhales steamy smoke. LaCoy's 
laugh triggers a memory:

						CUT TO:

INT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY (1964)

The flashback continues: Glen Whitehouse pushes his sons 
inside. Sally steps from sight. Out back, the firewood lies 
frozen amid futile shovel marks.

		POP
	That was some job.

		ROLFE
	We'll work at it everyday, promise.

		POP
	I think we made the point.

		WADE
		(mumbles)
	You just needed a drink.

Pop, swigging Canadian Club, turns:

		POP
	What was that?
		(no answer)
	You got something to say, say it! 
	Say it!

		WADE
		(soft)
	Nothing.

		POP
	You no-good pup!

Rolfe runs from the room screaming, "Mom!"

						CUT TO:

EXT. WICKHAM'S - DAY

The town's 24-hour restaurant. A bright new sign reads: "Home 
Made Cooking." Wade's grader out front.

						CUT TO:

INT. WICKHAM'S - DAY

Wade, eating lunch at the counter, talks with Nick Wickham:

		WADE
	It don't look right.

		NICK
	What?

		WADE
	The sign. It looks like it's spelled 
	wrong or something.

		NICK
	Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people 
	like you that keep this fucking town 
	from prospering. Whatever somebody 
	does to improve things around here, 
	you gotta find fault with it.

		WADE
	I'm not finding fault. It's a good 
	idea, good for you, good for the 
	town. Real modern too.

		NICK
	This town sucks.

		WADE
	Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's 
	something wrong with "Home Made 
	Cooking", that's all. The sign's 
	fine. What it says is wrong.

Margie Fogg heads over, sits:

		MARGIE
	Who needs it? Everybody who comes 
	here has been coming for years so 
	what they need a sign for?

Nick goes back to work.

		MARGIE
	You okay?

		WADE
	Yeah.

		MARGIE
	I'm sorry about what I said.

		WADE
	Said what?

		MARGIE
	About you and Jill and needing a 
	third person. She went back to 
	Lillian?

		WADE
	Forget it.

		MARGIE
		(touches his arm)
	I'm sorry.

		WADE
	I'm going to start one of those 
	custody suits. I don't give a fucking 
	shit. You know?

Wade's eyes well up.

		MARGIE
	You don't mean that.

		WADE
	Yeah. I mean that.

		MARGIE
		(arm around his 
		shoulders)
	No you don't. You're pissed, that's 
	all. You ought to cool off for a few 
	days then have a long talk with 
	Lillian. You know? Work it out with 
	her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's 
	not out to get you.

		WADE
	The hell she isn't. Lillian's been 
	trying to nail me to a cross since 
	the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me 
	a fucking lawyer from Concord and 
	get this thing, this divorce thing, 
	rearranged. I've been thinking about 
	it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or 
	something. Nobody owns nobody, 
	especially not kids. And I pay her.

		NICK
		(calls)
	Marg!

		WADE
	That goddamned woman. Thinks she can 
	cart Jill off and leave me alone 
	like this. I'm more than pissed, 
	Margie. I'm a whole lot more than 
	pissed. I been that plenty and I 
	know the difference. This is 
	different.

		NICK
	Marg! You got orders!

Wade and Margie stand. She wants to kiss him.

		MARGIE
	Call me.

		WADE
		(genuine)
	Tonight. Let's get together.

		MARGIE
	Okay.

Wade meets Nick halfway to the door.

		NICK
	You talked to Jack?

		WADE
	Not since last night. He took a guy 
	hunting.

		NICK
	The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! 
	That's what it sounds like. Not on 
	purpose. I assume accidental.

		WADE
		(shocked)
	Jack?

		NICK
	The other guy.

		WADE
	Where... how'd you hear that?

		NICK
	CB. Little while ago. One of the 
	boys on the way in picked up Jack on 
	the CB calling for state troopers. I 
	figured you'd know what really 
	happened. The fucking guy kill 
	himself? This Twombley, who the fuck 
	is he, anyhow?

		WADE
	No, I... I've been out on the grader 
	all morning. Twombley's summer people. 
	Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. 
	It was his idea for Jack to take him 
	hunting.
		(suddenly engaged)
	I gotta go.

Margie steps over as Wade exits.

	He don't care for you.

	Stop being jealous.

		WADE
	A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.

		LARIVIERE
	Huh?

		WADE
	I figured you already heard.

		LARIVIERE
		(urgent)
	Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving:

Gordon and Wade drive up the same road Jack took Twombley. 
Wade fiddles with the CB. No use: static.

		LARIVIERE
	Fuck. Turn it off.
		(Wade does)
	All you heard was there was some 
	kinda accident?

		WADE
	Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not 
	Jack. He's okay, I assume.

		LARIVIERE
	Fuck. You don't know how bad or 
	anything?

		WADE
	You mean Twombley?

		LARIVIERE
	Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out 
	that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

LaRiviere grunts disapproval as Wade slips the butt out his 
window.

		WADE
	He more than likely just shot himself 
	in the foot or something. That's 
	what usually happens.

		LARIVIERE
	I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.

		WADE
	I wish you had. I'd rather be deer 
	hunting instead of freezing my ass 
	on that fucking grader.

		LARIVIERE
	You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he 
	can't drive the grader worth shit.

		WADE
	Like hell.

Ahead, they see flashing lights and cars. A white emergency 
vehicle passes, jolting the pickup.

		LARIVIERE
		(frightened)
	That must've been Twombley. Jesus. I 
	bet that was Twombley.

		WADE
	You want me to follow them to 
	Littleton?

		LARIVIERE
	Let's get to the top and talk to 
	Jack first. He'll know what happened. 
	He fucking better. If this coulda 
	been avoided, I'll put that kid's 
	ass in a sling.

						CUT TO:

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE - DAY

Wade pulls behind three state trooper cars. Jack stands joking 
with the TROOPERS, one of whom holds a German shepherd on a 
leash. LaRiviere and Wade jump out. Jack, suddenly serious, 
turns to LaRiviere:

		JACK
	You heard the news.

		LARIVIERE
	I hear Twombley got shot.

		JACK
	Yeah.

Wade walks over to trooper ASA BROWN, pets the shepherd.

		BROWN
	Watch the dog, Wade. Takes a mind 
	to, he'll tear your fucking head 
	off.

		LARIVIERE
		(to Jack)
	Bad?

		BROWN
	Thirty-thirty at close range.

		LARIVIERE
	Jesus.

		WADE
	Will he make it?

		BROWN
		(shakes head)
	D.O.A. Blew the bastard wide open. 
	Had a hole in back you could put 
	your head into. Pretty big hole in 
	front too. You could've put your 
	fist into that one.

		LARIVIERE
		(to Jack)
	You see it?

		JACK
	Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. 
	I spotted this buck, then I heard 
	the gun go off and Twombley was gone. 
	I looked over the little cliff we 
	was using for a stand and there the 
	fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it 
	right in.

		LARIVIERE
	This is gonna be one fucking mess to 
	clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and 
	daughter are up the weekend. Didn't 
	you say you'd seen him, Wade?

		WADE
	I seen 'em. Near ran me over.

		BROWN
	You wanna tell 'em, Gordon? You knew 
	the old man.

		LARIVIERE
	What the fuck. My day's already 
	ruined.
		(to Wade)
	Give me the keys. You can go back 
	with Jack. You still got a shitload 
	of plowing to do.

		WADE
	It ain't done, if that's what you 
	mean.

		LARIVIERE
	Something bugging you?

		WADE
	Yeah. A few things.

		LARIVIERE
	Well, right now we're not too 
	interested. Finish up what you gotta 
	do, then you can get bugged on your 
	own time.

Brown walks off with shepherd.

		LARIVIERE
		(to Jack)
	Might as well take the rest of the 
	day off. You look sort of fucked up. 
	You've been paid for the day, anyhow, 
	right?

		JACK
	Not exactly. I mean, he never paid 
	me.

		LARIVIERE
	You'll get your money. Don't talk to 
	any newspapers about this. Twombley's 
	a big deal down in Massachusetts, 
	you know. Tell them your lawyer says 
	you shouldn't comment.

		JACK
	Lawyer? I don't need no lawyer, do 
	I?

		LARIVIERE
	No, of course not. Just say it, that's 
	all.

Wade watches LaRiviere get into his pickup, drive off.

		WADE
	Where'd Twombley get shot?

		JACK
	In the chest.

		WADE
		(offers cigarette)
	No, I mean whereabouts.

		JACK
		(points)
	A half mile in, along the old lumber 
	road.

		WADE
	You bring him up yourself? That's a 
	steep climb.

		JACK
	The ambulance guys lugged him up.

		WADE
	You stayed away?

		JACK
	Yeah.

		WADE
	Where'd you get the blood?

		JACK
	What blood?

		WADE
	On your sleeve.

		JACK
	Musta... How'd I know? What're you 
	doing, playing cop?

		WADE
	I gotta make a report to Fish and 
	Game. I was just wondering, that's 
	all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, 
	I mean?

		JACK
	Who the fuck knows? Musta slipped or 
	something. I just heard the gun go 
	off.

		WADE
	I never seen a man shot before. Not 
	even in the service. Must be 
	something.

		JACK
	Well, I didn't actually see him do 
	it. Like I said.

		WADE
	Sure you did.

		JACK
	What?

		WADE
	Saw him do it?

		JACK
	What the fuck you telling me, Wade? 
	I never seen the guy get shot, I 
	told you that.

		WADE
	You musta seen him get shot. I know 
	you did.

		JACK
	Let's get the fuck outta here. You're 
	not making any sense, man.

They walk over to Jack's burgundy pickup. Wade eyes the rifles 
in the gun rack.

		WADE
	There's your old twenty-gauge, and 
	that there's the new Browning you 
	was showing me last night. This must 
	be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very 
	fancy tooling. Probably fired one 
	time. It's a beautiful piece of work.
		(touches it)
	But what the hell, Jack, I guess you 
	deserve it. Right's right.

		JACK
		(starts engine)
	Yeah.

		WADE
	Twombley sure as hell won't be 
	shooting it again.

		JACK
	He sure as hell won't.

INT. WADE'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Late. Wade Whitehouse, lying in bed with an icepack on his 
cheek, talks on the phone:

		WADE
	Rolfe.

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	Wade?

		WADE
	Yeah, brother, look, I was calling 
	cause -- has there been anything on 
	TV in Boston about a hunting accident 
	with a guy named Twombley, Evan 
	Twombley?

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	There was something. It happened up 
	your way.

		WADE
	Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was 
	with him. Maybe you do too. Jack 
	Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with 
	me. He's my best friend.

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	Wade, it's late. I know you're 
	probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed 
	reading. We got different habits.

		WADE
	No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm 
	calling because I need you to listen. 
	You're supposed to be a smart guy. 
	You're a professor. I got this theory. 
	Jack says he didn't see Twombley 
	shot but he did.

						CUT TO:

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE - DAY

Wade's theory -- in black-and-white: Twombley's footing slips. 
Jack turns to watch. Twombley's gun hits frozen rocks, fires, 
blows a hole through his chest.

						CUT TO:

INT. WADE'S TRAILER - NIGHT

		WADE
	It'll come out Jack lied and the 
	kid'll get hung for it.

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	He was scheduled to testify for a 
	committee investigating organized 
	crime in New England and the 
	construction business.

		WADE
	Who?

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	Twombley.

		WADE
	No shit.

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	You think Jack shot him?

		WADE
	Well, it was an accident.

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	They were out deer hunting, right? 
	Jack probably heard the gun go off, 
	then came back and found the body.

						CUT TO:

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE - DAY

Another theory: Black-and-white. Jack sees a figure run from 
Twombley's body.

						CUT TO:

INT. WADE'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Wade shifts the phone from ear to ear:

		WADE
	Lillian was here. In Lawford.

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	Huh?

		WADE
	The night before the shooting.

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	How was she?

		WADE
	Picked up Jill. She was supposed to 
	visit for the weekend for Halloween. 
	She wanted to go home.

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	Who?

		WADE
	Jill. I was thinking of getting a 
	lawyer. Maybe you can help me.

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	What happened?

		WADE
	A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. 
	You know, 'cause of Jill.

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	Don't think about it. You're 
	exhausted.

		WADE
	Yeah, I guess.

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	Get some sleep.

		WADE
	I get to feeling like a whipped dog 
	some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm 
	going to bite back. I swear it.

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	Haven't you already done a bit of 
	that?

		WADE
	No, no, I haven't. Not really. I've 
	growled a little, but I haven't bit.

Sound of GUNSHOT.

						CUT TO:

EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY

Wade's bubble-top Fairlane drives through snow covered hills.

						CUT TO:

EXT. MEL GORDON'S HOUSE - DAY

The Fairlane is parked outside a substantial summer house 
with a wide porch and frozen pond. The "speeding" BMW in the 
drive. Wade knocks on the front door. An 8 year-old boy 
answers the door. Wade speaks; the boy goes back inside.

MRS. GORDON, 30, delicate, beautiful, wearing a dark green 
robe, comes to the door. Her eyes are red-rimmed. Wade has 
seen her before, but not this close. He feels awkward.

		MRS. GORDON
	Who are you?

		WADE
	I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was 
	wondering, is your husband here?

		MRS. GORDON
	He's asleep. We were up very late.

		WADE
	Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that 
	I'm real sorry about your father, 
	Mrs. Twombley.

		MRS. GORDON
	Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.

		WADE
	Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just 
	had a little business to settle with 
	Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police 
	officer.

		MRS. GORDON
	Something about my father?

		WADE
	Oh, no. No, it's a... it's a traffic 
	thing. No big deal.

		MRS. GORDON
	Can't it wait, then?

MEL GORDON, 40, dark-eyed, wearing a tartan robe, steps behind 
his wife.

		MEL GORDON
	Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.

		WADE
	How's that?

Mel folds his arms. His wife goes inside.

		MEL GORDON
	I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'

		WADE
	Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I 
	come all the way to serve somebody a 
	summons, I don't call ahead for an 
	appointment.

		MEL GORDON
	What the hell are you talking about?

		WADE
	I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving 
	violation.

		MEL GORDON
	Moving violation! I just got out of 
	bed and you're telling me you're 
	giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? 
	Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, 
	Whitehouse? You're nuts?

		WADE
		(writing)
	Yesterday morning, you passed a 
	stopped school bus, which was flashing 
	its lights, then you--

		MEL GORDON
		(stops Wade's arm)
	Hold on!

		WADE
		(wrenches hand free)
	Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. 
	Gordon.

		MEL GORDON
	You're talking about a goddamned 
	ticket, from when I passed you at 
	the school where you were deciding 
	to hold up traffic while dreaming of 
	becoming a traffic cop or something?

		WADE
	Don't give me a hard time, Mr. Gordon. 
	I'm just --

		MEL GORDON
	Doing your fucking job. I know. I 
	watch television too.

		WADE
	Yes. Here's your ticket.

		MEL GORDON
		(refusing ticket)
	You get the hell out of my house 
	now, asshole. And know this -- you 
	are going to be a lucky asshole if I 
	haven't got you fired before the day 
	is out. I can do it with one phone 
	call, and I'm pissed enough to do it 
	now!

Mel Gordon moves Wade out of the door, slams it. Wade steps 
away, looks back at the house. Mrs. Gordon watches him from 
the window.

A wood frame house off the main drag. Snowing.

						CUT TO:

INT. MARGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Wade and Margie, post-coital:

		MARGIE
	Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. 
	More than most. But he'll be okay in 
	a few weeks.

		WADE
	There's something funny about that 
	shooting. There's lots funny about 
	it, actually.

		MARGIE
	I heard he was drunk at Toby's last 
	night and got in a fight with Hettie. 
	He drove off without her...

		WADE
	I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't 
	happen the way Jack says it did.

		MARGIE
	...Jack's turned into one of those 
	men who are permanently angry. He 
	used to be a sweet kid, but it's 
	like, when he found out he couldn't 
	play ball anymore, he changed. Now 
	he's like everyone else.

		WADE
	I've been wondering if maybe Jack 
	shot Twombley, instead of Twombley 
	shooting himself. I've been wondering 
	maybe Jack shot him on purpose.

		MARGIE
	Wade! How can you even think such a 
	thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, 
	shoot Twombley on purpose?

						CUT TO:

EXT. ACCIDENT SCENE - DAY

Black-and-white. A further theory: Jack bends over the fallen 
Twombley, holds a tarp to protect his chest from blood spray. 
He shoots Twombley with his own gun.

						CUT TO:

INT. MARGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

		WADE
	Money.

		MARGIE
	Jack doesn't need money.

		WADE
	Everybody needs money. Except guys 
	like Twombley and that sonofabitch 
	son-in-law of his. People like that.

		MARGIE
	Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, 
	who would pay him?

		WADE
	Lots of people. Guy like Evan 
	Twombley, Boston union official, 
	probably got lots of people want to 
	see him dead. The Government's been 
	investigating his links with the 
	Mafia.

		MARGIE
		(laughs)
	The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?

		WADE
	No, I just know Jack's lying about 
	what happened. He just seemed -- I 
	know that kid, what he's like inside. 
	He's a lot like I was at his age.

		MARGIE
	You wouldn't have done anything like 
	that, shot someone for money.

		WADE
	No. Not for money. But, if somebody'd 
	given me half a damned excuse -- I 
	was pretty fucked up, you know.

		MARGIE
		(smiles)
	But not now.

Wade sits on the edge of the bed, sighs. Lapses into thought. 
Margie caresses his back, kisses it. He winces.

		MARGIE
	When you gonna get that tooth fixed?

Wade looks at her, brushes the hair off her face:

		WADE
	I can see what you looked like as a 
	kid.

		MARGIE
	You knew me as a kid.

		WADE
	Yeah, but never what you looked like. 
	Not really. Never really studied 
	your face, like now. I was never 
	able to see you as a kid when you 
	were a kid until now, this way.

		MARGIE
	What way?

		WADE
	After making love. I like it. It's 
	nice to see that in a grown-up person.

		MARGIE
	It's nice.

Wade walks naked to the kitchen, returns with two beers, one 
for Marg. He gets in bed. She, thinking, sips:

		MARGIE
	Don't you think, do you still think 
	it's a good idea to press this custody 
	thing -- just now?

		WADE
	I'm her father -- supposed to be, 
	but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. 
	It may be the only thing in my life 
	I've been so clear about wanting. 
	Even if it takes a big fight.

		MARGIE
	Then... I guess you have to.

		WADE
		(silence)
	There's another thing I've been 
	thinking about. I don't know how you 
	feel about the idea, Margie, because 
	we've never talked about it. But 
	I've been thinking lately, I've been 
	thinking we should get married 
	sometime. You and me.

		MARGIE
		(uncertain)
	Oh, Wade.

		WADE
	I've been thinking about it, that's 
	all.

		MARGIE
	You've been married twice --

		WADE
	It was to the same woman. I was just 
	a kid...
		(Marg looks)
	It's not like a marriage proposal or 
	anything, just a thought. Something 
	for you and me to talk about and 
	think about. You know?

		MARGIE
	Alright. I'll think about it.

		WADE
	Good.

He kisses her. His jaw winces in pain.

						CUT TO:

INT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAYBREAK (1964)

THE FLASHBACK CONTINUES:

Glen Whitehouse, plastered, yells at Wade, age 13:

		POP
	I've got sons, Goddamnit, oh my God, 
	have I got sons! Wade? Rolfe? 
	Elbourne? You love me boys? Do you 
	love your Pop? Of course you do!

Wade, frightened, retreats as Sally enters in her housecoat.

		SALLY
	Glen, stop --

		POP
	Oh, Jesus, Sally, you are such a 
	Goddamned good person! Capital G. 
	You are so much better than I am, I 
	who am no good at all, you who are a 
	truly good person, like a fucking 
	saint! Beyond fucking com-pare.

Glen reaches for the Canadian Club; Sally tries to block his 
hand. Glen pulls his arm from hers, clipping her cheek with 
the bottle.

Sally gasps, grabs her cheek.

Wade pushes between them, protecting his mother.

		POP
	My big boy bursting out of the seams 
	of his jeans!

Pop clenches his fist. Wade vainly looks Rolfe's direction 
for help.

		SALLY
	Don't!

		POP
	You little prick!

Pop's fist comes crashing down. Wade raises his arms to 
protect himself. Wade's arm bone CRACKS with the blow. Wade 
grimaces in pain.

		SALLY
	Glen, stop!

INT./EXT. WADE'S CAR - DAY

Wade, washed and changed, drives; Marg sits beside him. They 
head north. Deer rifles echo from the woods.

		MARGIE
	Did you tell them?
		(no answer)
	That we were coming?

		WADE
	Don't you think it's proper for a 
	fella to introduce his girl to his 
	parents?

		MARGIE
	I know your parents.

		WADE
	I just want to pick up my divorce 
	papers. For the lawyer. It won't 
	take long.

						CUT TO:

EXT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY

Sun slants over Parker Mountain; they pull up. The house, 
once white, is peeling. Polyurethane flaps over dark windows. 
The 1960 red Ford pickup sits long frozen in the open barn.

		MARGIE
		(getting out)
	Are you sure they're home? Did you 
	call?

		WADE
	The truck's here. Looks like they've 
	stayed inside since the snow started.

They stamp their feet on the porch; Wade turns the knob. 
Locked. It seems abandoned.

		WADE
	Strange.

		MARGIE
	Think they're alright?

		WADE
	Of course! I would've heard.

		MARGIE
	How?

		WADE
	I don't know for Christ's sake!

They round the house, try the back door. Wade knocks loudly. 
GLEN WHITEHOUSE, 70, opens the door, stands inside. He wears 
long underwear, stained woolen trousers, slippers.

						CUT TO:

INT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY

		WADE
	Pop, Pop, you okay?

Glen shuffles toward the stove; they follow. He starts a 
fire.

		WADE
	Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the 
	cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?

		POP
	Sleeping.

		WADE
	You remember Margie Fogg?

		POP
	From Wickham's. Been a while. Like 
	some coffee?

		WADE
	How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen 
	you in town for a while.

		POP
	We're alright. Your Ma's sleeping. 
	You want me to get her?

		WADE
	Yeah.

Pop goes to the bedroom.

		WADE
		(to Marg)
	Jesus. Nothing's changed around here.

Pop returns.

		WADE
	Where's Ma?

		POP
	She's coming.

		MARGIE
	Have you been heating the house? Not 
	just with the stove.

		POP
	There's a furnace.

		MARGIE
	You're not using it today?

		POP
	It's broke I guess. There's an 
	electric in the bedroom.

		MARGIE
	Maybe Wade should take a look at it. 
	Your pipes'll freeze.
		(Pop nods)
	Wade, would you do that?

Wade, concerned, pushes open the BEDROOM door:

		WADE
	Ma? It's Wade. Can I come in?

He steps inside. On the bed, Sally Whitehouse, wrapped in 
blankets, lies dead. He walks over, beside the small electric 
heater, touches her forehead. Her skin is chalk white.

		WADE
	Oh, Lord.

Margie steps into the doorway. Pop joins:

		POP
	Coffee's perked.

		MARGIE
	When did she die?

		POP
	Is...? She's dead then?

		WADE
	Yeah.

		POP
	I checked on her. She had the electric 
	heater. Cold don't bother her as 
	much as me. Which is why I give her 
	the heater.

		WADE
		(kneels over mother)
	Is there something wrong with the 
	phone?

		POP
	In the living room.

		WADE
	Why didn't you call and have the 
	furnace fixed?

		POP
	Wade. I thought she was alright. 
	Till this morning she was.

Pop goes to the dresser, pours himself Canadian Club. Wade 
opens his mother's mouth, attempts respiration.

		POP
	It makes me sad.

		MARGIE
	Can --?

		POP
		(sits)
	Makes me sad it was her. Instead of 
	me. I shoulda froze.

						CUT TO:

EXT. ROLFE'S CAR - DAY

ROLFE WHITEHOUSE, 38, drives his four-door Toyota west: 
through Massachusetts, toward New Hampshire. His face bespeaks 
tolerance, objectivity -- in short, education. It's also 
Wade's face.

		ROLFE (V.O.)
	Wade called me, as usual, late at 
	night. I knew it was Wade -- no one 
	else calls me at that hour -- and I 
	was ready to listen to another chapter 
	in one of his ongoing sagas. There 
	was the detective story concerning 
	the shooting of Evan Twombley and 
	the family melodrama about Wade's 
	custody fight with Lillian. But not 
	this time.

						CUT TO:

EXT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY

Rolfe's Toyota sits with other cars.

		ROLFE (V.O.)
	Wade was telling a different story, 
	or so it seemed then, one in which I 
	myself was a character. He had called 
	to tell me that sometime the previous 
	night our mother had died, and he 
	had discovered the body when he'd 
	gone over to visit her and our father 
	with Margie Fogg. Pop was okay, but 
	kind of out of it. Worse than usual, 
	maybe, though no drunker than usual.

						CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Friends and relatives gather in the living room: Wade, Rolfe, 
Glen, LaRiviere, Margie, an aging couple, REVEREND DOUGHTY, 
30, thin, wearing glasses and an avocado-green suit.

		WADE
		(finishing a beer)
	Shouldn't we get this show on the 
	road, now that Rolfe's here?

No one moves. LaRiviere checks his watch. Wade shrugs:

		WADE
	Pointless to stand around in church 
	with nothing to do, I guess.

		ROLFE
	What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing 
	her?

Margie's face tells Rolfe he's touched on a sensitive subject.

		MARGIE
	They'll be at the church and the 
	cemetery.

Wade opens the frig, takes out another beer:

		WADE
	Anyone else want one? Rolfe?

		ROLFE
	No thanks. I don't drink.

		WADE
	Yeah. I forgot.

		LARIVIERE
	How you holding up, Wade?

		WADE
	I'm fine, fine.

		LARIVIERE
	You Rolfe?
		(Rolfe nods)
	I remember you from high school. 
	You're a teacher now? Harvard?

		ROLFE
	B.U.

		LARIVIERE
	I haven't seen you around. I don't 
	suppose there's much reason for you 
	to come this way.

Rev. Doughty calls for Glen Whitehouse, who has been sitting, 
silent, drinking, to join the others:

		REV. DOUGHTY
	Come, Glen, join us. Let's kneel for 
	a moment of prayer before the service. 
	Wade? Rolfe?

		ROLFE
	Well...

Wade, expressionless, looks at Rolfe. Rolfe, embarrassed, 
trying to do the right thing, helps his father kneel beside 
Rev. Doughty. The others join the circle.

		WADE
	This is nuts.

		MARGIE
		(reproving)
	Wade.

		REV. DOUGHTY
	Dear Heavenly Father, Lord of Hosts, 
	we come to Thee to beseech Thy 
	blessings and commend to You the 
	soul of our beloved wife and mother, 
	Sally Whitehouse, to be one with You 
	and walk with You --

Pop mutters something. Wade, Rolfe and Marg exchange glances. 
He mutters louder:

		POP
	...goddamned hair on her head.

He rises over LaRiviere, turns, exclaims:

		POP
	Not a one of you is worth a goddamned 
	hair on that good woman's head!

Doughty freezes.

		WADE
	Pop! Don't do this now, Pop.

Pop knocks back a drink as the others stand.

		LARIVIERE
	Maybe I'll head on over to the church.

		REV. DOUGHTY
	This is a difficult time.

Gordon and the couple file out. Doughty, Glen, Rolfe, Wade 
and Margie remain.

		WADE
	Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.

		POP
		(raising fists)
	Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no 
	big deal. Tell me how a single one 
	of you is worth a single hair on 
	that woman's head.

		REV. DOUGHTY
	Give up this demon.

		POP
	Go fuck yourself!

Wade, eyes blazing, squares off. Son to father.

		ROLFE
	Wade, just leave it.

		POP
		(mocking)
	Listen to your little brother. 'Wade, 
	just leave it.' Candy-asses. All of 
	you. That's what I've got for 
	children. Candyasses. 'Wade, just 
	leave it.' Praise the Lord! 'Just 
	leave it!'

Wade stiffens. Pop cocks his fist. Marg, screaming, jumps 
between them as Pop swings.

The old man bounces blows off Margie's arms and shoulders.

Wade pushes Marg aside, grabs his father in a bear hug and 
walks him backwards, flat against the wall. Wade releases 
him. Pop, frail, collapses to the floor. Wade kneels over 
him:

		WADE
	If you ever touch her again, I'll 
	kill you. I swear it.

						CUT TO:

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

Townspeople and friends cluster around the gravesite: Pop, 
LaRiviere, Jack and Hettie, LaCoy, Chub Merritt, Nick, Jimmy, 
Lillian, Jill and Horner, Rolfe, Wade and Margie.

		ROLFE (V.O.)
	The day of the funeral was almost 
	springlike. The snowline crossed New 
	Hampshire west to east, retreating 
	northward to Concord where it melted 
	by midmorning.

Rev. Doughty finishes. The mourners exchange farewells. Wade 
looks at Lillian. Margie and Rolfe, escorting Wade's father, 
let him be. He walks over, hugs Jill.

		JILL
	Dad.

		WADE
		(to Lillian)
	I'm glad you're here. Can you stay 
	for a while?

Lillian hesitates, shakes her head 'no.'

		WADE
	You ever come to your father's grave 
	anymore?

		LILLIAN
	No, not anymore. It's too... it's 
	too far.

		WADE
	We should talk.

		LILLIAN
	We've done all our talking, Wade.

		WADE
	It's just...

		LILLIAN
	Let the past be.
		(beat)
	I'm sorry about your mother. I liked 
	her. You never know how much women 
	like that suffer. It's like they 
	live their lives with the sound turned 
	off -- and then they're gone.

		JILL
		(tugging at Lillian)
	Mom.

		LILLIAN
	She has an ice-skating lesson at 
	four.

		JILL
	I'm taking ice-skating, Daddy!

He kisses Jill, says goodbyes, walks back to Rolfe and Margie. 
Ahead, LaRiviere walks with Jack.

EXT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY

Wade and Rolfe leave Margie and Pop in the kitchen as they 
step out back.

		WADE
	Let's dig out Pop's truck before the 
	skin of the snow freezes up.

They grab snow shovels propped against the porch, walk to 
the barn. Firewood's stacked alongside.

						CUT TO:

INT. BARN - DAY

Shafts of light filter through the ramshackle structure. A 
snow drift nearly buries Glen's red truck. Wade and Rolfe 
break away the packed snow.

		ROLFE
	What about Margie?

		WADE
	What about her?

		ROLFE
	Well, do you still plan to get 
	married?

		WADE
	Yeah. She'll probably quit her job 
	and stay out here with Pop. We can't 
	leave him alone here, he'll set the 
	damn place on fire. With Jill here a 
	lot, it'll be good to have Margie 
	around. Things are going to change 
	in that department, by the way. I 
	got a custody lawyer in Concord. I'm 
	gonna see him tomorrow. All hell's 
	gonna break loose, but it's worth 
	it.

They finish clearing the snow. Wade gets in the truck, starts 
the engine. Rolfe waits for Wade.

		WADE
	I want to let the gas run out. I 
	don't want the bastard driving drunk, 
	and he's always drunk now. After, 
	we'll hide the keys.

		ROLFE
	Anything new about the shooting? 
	Twombley?

		WADE
		(reluctant)
	I guess it was an accident, like 
	everybody thinks.

		ROLFE
	Want to know what I think happened?

Wade opens the glove compartment, finds a bottle of Canadian 
Club. He unscrews the cap.

		WADE
	Find them everywhere.
		(swigs)

		ROLFE
	I think your first response to the 
	Twombley shooting was the correct 
	one.

		WADE
	Which is?

		ROLFE
	That it wasn't an accident.

		WADE
	Then who shot him?

		ROLFE
	Well, your friend, I think. Jack 
	Hewitt.

		WADE
	Motive. You gotta have a motive.

		ROLFE
	Money.

		WADE
	Who'd pay him that kind of money? 
	Not the mob. They got their own guys. 
	Specialists.

		ROLFE
		(agreeing)
	They wouldn't deal with a guy like 
	Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley 
	is suddenly dead?

		WADE
		(swigs)
	I don't know. You tell me.

		ROLFE
	Okay. It's likely there are people 
	in the union who don't want Twombley 
	to testify. They probably include 
	his son-in-law who's vice-president 
	and will probably be the next 
	president. I read that in the papers. 
	What's his name, Mel Gordon?

		WADE
	Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told 
	you about. I did, didn't I?

		ROLFE
	Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware 
	of illegal union loans or whatever, 
	starts nosing around cause of the 
	investigation and finds out. Finds 
	out his son-in-law is involved.

		WADE
	So Mel Gordon wouldn't want a 
	professional hit. That'd make the 
	feds dig deeper. He wants an accident.

		ROLFE
	A hunting accident is perfect.

		WADE
	Shit, around here, you shoot somebody 
	in the woods, you say it was an 
	accident, you get fined fifty bucks 
	and your hunting license lifted. 
	Jack's probably saying the guy shot 
	himself cause he ain't got his deer 
	yet and don't want his license pulled.

The truck sputters, stops. Wade pulls the keys.

		WADE
	It's too neat. Things ain't that 
	neat. It makes me mad. That somebody 
	can pay to kill somebody, his own 
	father-in-law, and not be punished 
	for it. Don't that piss you off?

		ROLFE
	Not particularly.

		WADE
	Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you 
	care what's right?

		ROLFE
	I care about what happened. The truth. 
	I'm a student of history, remember?

The sun is down. Wade tucks the keys in a knotted board.

		ROLFE
	I was thinking about that story you 
	told me, about Pop and chopping the 
	firewood out of the ice and after.

		WADE
	Yeah.

		ROLFE
	I hate to disappoint you, but I don't 
	think it happened.

		WADE
	Of course it happened. Why would I 
	lie about it?

		ROLFE
	It may have happened, but not the 
	way you said.

		WADE
	You think I wouldn't remember a thing 
	like that?

		ROLFE
	It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I 
	heard about it. When I heard about 
	it, it was about Elbourne.

		WADE
	We'd have to go digging in Vietnam 
	to ask him.

		ROLFE
	And Elbourne and Mom took you to the 
	doctor and told him you fell from 
	the hay loft.

		WADE
		(laughs)
	Well, I never heard that one.

		ROLFE
	I remember clearly cause when I heard 
	I became real careful around Pop. I 
	was a careful child and I became a 
	careful adult, but at least I wasn't 
	afflicted by that man's violence.

		WADE
		(laughs again)
	That's what you think.

Rolfe looks out: the cobalt sky has turned black.

		ROLFE
	I gotta head back. It's a long drive.

They walk toward the house.

						CUT TO:

EXT. LARIVIERE CO. GARAGE - DAY

Wade walks in as Jack and Jimmy prepare to head out, their 
drilling rig loaded with pipe. Gordon yells at Jack:

		LARIVIERE
	Put out that fucking cigarette!

Jack opens the truck ashtray.

		LARIVIERE
	Not there, asshole. Flush it!

Hewitt trudges to the john.

		WADE
	Morning, Gordon.

LaRiviere smiles, goes to his office as Wade hangs his coat 
in his locker. Jack cruises over.

		JACK
	I'm fucking out of here.

		WADE
	Lawford?

		JACK
	Out of this fucking job. This job 
	sucks. Working outside in the winter 
	sucks.

Jack gets in the cab of the drilling truck. Wade follows.

		JACK
	Open the door, will ya?

		WADE
	Why don't you quit now, you want out 
	so bad?

		JACK
	Open the door. We're late.

		WADE
	I mean it -- you got enough money 
	now. Head out for California. Surf's 
	up, Jack, and you're digging wells 
	in the snow.

		JACK
	What do you mean I got money? I'm as 
	broke as you.

Wade grins, goes to activate the door.

		WADE
	Looney Tunes, Jack. Fucking Looney 
	Tunes!

The drilling truck pulls out the garage, onto the road. From 
the opposite direction a black BMW slows, enters. Mel Gordon.

Wade, all eyes and ears, watches. Mel Gordon parks in front 
of the office, gets out. Elaine calls:

		ELAINE (O.S.)
	Mr. Gordon!

		MEL GORDON
	The boss in?

		ELAINE (O.S.)
	Yes indeedy!

Wade flips the door switch. Mel Gordon and LaRiviere talk. 
Yeah.

EXT. CONCORD - DAY

The South Main Street office of J. Battle Hand, lawyer. 
Concord is a real town, with traffic, stores, people with 
places to go.

						CUT TO:

INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY

J. BATTLE HAND, 60, sits in a wheel chair behind his desk. 
Wade, uncomfortable in work clothes, tries not to show it.

		WADE
	I screwed up the divorce. I agreed 
	with everything she said. I wanted 
	her to like me. I just want to be a 
	good father.

		HAND
	It would help if you were married, 
	if there was someone at home while 
	you work.

		WADE
	I plan to. Soon.

		HAND
	How soon?

		WADE
	This spring.

		HAND
	Good. It would help if there were 
	some drug or alcohol abuse on the 
	part of your ex-wife. Sexual problems 
	upsetting to the child.

		WADE
	It looks pretty hopeless, don't it?

		HAND
	No, not exactly. I'll look at the 
	divorce decree, see if we can get it 
	redrawn. Interview your daughter. 
	Jill, right?

		WADE
	Yes.

		HAND
	Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You 
	can mail it.

		WADE
	Jesus. How much... how much will the 
	whole thing cost?

		HAND
	Hard to say. If we go for custody, 
	depositions, psychiatric evaluations, 
	it could drag on. Ten or twelve 
	thousand dollars. She could win on 
	appeal. If we just want to get the 
	visitation rights redrawn, assuming 
	they're unduly restrictive, it 
	wouldn't be more than twenty-five 
	hundred.

		WADE
	Oh.

		HAND
		(sensing situation)
	You might be better off legally as 
	well as financially to just go for 
	the --

		WADE
	Yeah. I know. The custody suit thing 
	was just my getting back at her. I'm 
	not as dumb as I look. Whatever you 
	say. I love my daughter.
		(Hand nods)
	I'll send you the five hundred.

Wade stands; Hand motors to the door. Wade puts his fingers 
in his mouth. His tooth throbs.

EXT. LARIVIERE CO. - DAY

Fairlane squad car in its customary spot.

						CUT TO:

INT. LARIVIERE'S OFFICE - DAY

Wade and Gordon speak. LaRiviere is relaxed, open: a "new 
Gordon."

		WADE
	Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch 
	is going out again.

		LARIVIERE
	You ever think of getting a new car, 
	Wade?

		WADE
	On what you pay me?

		LARIVIERE
	Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have 
	him pick up Wade's car, fix the 
	clutch.

		ELAINE (O.S.)
	What!

		LARIVIERE
		(to Wade)
	Use the pickup. I'll bill it to the 
	town. You're the town police officer 
	and the town police officer should 
	have a decent car. You want a new 
	car or not?

		WADE
	What do I have to do for it?

		LARIVIERE
	Nothing, Wade, I've been thinking. 
	You don't get enough appreciation 
	around here and it's time we changed 
	things a little.

		WADE
	I saw Mel Gordon in here this morning.

		LARIVIERE
	So?

		WADE
	He say anything about the summons I 
	tried to give him? Sonofabitch 
	wouldn't accept it.

		LARIVIERE
	Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out 
	right after the man's father-in-law 
	shot himself. Let it go. Call it a 
	favor to me.

		WADE
	You? Why?

		LARIVIERE
	Mel's doing some business with me. 
	It's nice to do favors for people 
	you do business with. He was in a 
	hurry. No big deal.

		WADE
	That was before Twombley was shot. 
	Before he knew.

		LARIVIERE
	What's the difference? Take my truck, 
	take a rest -- stop worrying about 
	Mel Gordon. Have you decided what to 
	do with your old man's place -- he 
	going to stay there?

		WADE
		(takes out cigarette)
	Want to buy?

		LARIVIERE
	Don't light that in here. I'm 
	allergic.

		WADE
	I won't. You interested?

		LARIVIERE
	Maybe.

		WADE
	You and Mel Gordon?

		LARIVIERE
	Could be.

		WADE
		(voice rising)
	Always count on old Wade for a good 
	screwing. Why should I always pay 
	more, sell cheap? Why should you 
	guys make all the money. You and Mel 
	and Jack. Right's right.

Wade pulls out Bic, lights cigarette.

		LARIVIERE
		(waving arms)
	Out! Out!

Wade smiles, exits.

						CUT TO:

EXT. RT. 29 - NIGHT

Wade, driving Gordon's 4x4 with running lights and roll bar, 
takes 29 toward Pop's farm.

A pickup passes him: Jack Hewitt's burgundy Ford. Wade stops. 
Jack turns up Parker Mountain -- the road to the accident 
scene. Something's up.

Wade turns and follows. Jack's fresh tracks lead the way. 
Hewitt is driving fast. Wade keeps up.

Jack, far ahead, approaches the accident scene. Stops. Night 
has fallen.

Wade comes over a low rise, spots Jack's pickup. He kills 
the lights, parks to block Jack's exit.

Silence. Footsteps in the snow. Wade watches, listens. What's 
he doing? Looking for evidence?

The burgundy pickup engine suddenly ROARS -- Jack's back and 
at the wheel -- the tires squeal, spit snow as he spins past 
Wade.

Wade starts his engine, gives pursuit. The pickups gun their 
engines, bumper to bumper, down mountain roads, lumber roads, 
rocky trails. Wild headlamps their only guide.

						CUT TO:

EXT. POND - NIGHT

A trail turns sharply past a shallow beaver pond -- too 
sharply for Jack. He crashes through a stand of skinny birches 
straight out onto the pond. The pickup's momentum carries it 
across the pond.

Wade drops into first gear, follows, his headlights reflecting 
ice. He drives directly to Jack, bumper to bumper, headlight 
to headlight. Jack sticks his head out:

		JACK
	You crazy sonofabitch! You'll sink 
	us both! Get off the fucking ice! 
	Get off!

Wade doesn't budge. Jack backs away; Wade inches forward.

Hewitt's trapped. Trees behind him. Neither truck has traction 
on ice.

Jack steps out, swinging his fists wildly. Wade gets out. 
Jacks grabs his rifle, points it:

		JACK
	I'll shoot you, Wade, I swear it! 
	I'll fucking shoot you dead if you 
	don't move away from that truck!

Wade backs off.

		JACK
	Don't move! I'll shoot you dead if 
	you move!

Jack gets back in his pickup, maneuvers it slowly around the 
Dodge, crosses the ice and is gone.

Wade stands in darkness. The only sound his idling truck, 
the wind. Then a third sound -- the snap of ice. Ice cracks 
ripple from the middle of the pond. Ice planes tip around 
the truck.

LaRiviere's snazzy Dodge slips, descends, disappears.

Headlights glow under water, then go out. "Our Business Is 
Going In The Hole."

Wade, alone in darkness, plops into the water, paddles to 
shore. Freezing, he finds Jack's tire tracks in the snow. He 
bangs his jaw.

						CUT TO:

EXT. WICKHAM'S - NIGHT

A car drops Wade off. "Home Made Cooking."

						CUT TO:

INT. WICKHAM'S - NIGHT

Wade enters the empty diner. His clothes frozen.

		NICK
	Your father's in back, Wade. Marg 
	had to babysit him. She moved in 
	with you, huh?
		(looking closer)
	What happened?

Wade goes to the kitchen. Glen Whitehouse, washing dishes 
with Margie, looks up:

		POP
	Ah, the prodigal son.

		NICK
	About fucking time.

		POP
	Look, got me a new job, second cook 
	and bottle washer!

		MARGIE
	What happened?

		WADE
	Jesus Christ, Pop, let's go home. I 
	got waylaid. Sorry.

		POP
	The fuck you got waylaid. You follow 
	your prick around like it was your 
	nose.

		NICK
		(enters)
	Can it, Whitehouse.
		(to Wade)
	Get him out of here. It was funny at 
	first, but I'm tired.

		MARGIE
	There's clothes in the back.

Wade's old man talks as he dresses:

		POP
	Let's go home? What home is that? 
	Your home? My home? Let's have a 
	talk about that. You're fucking sly, 
	Wade. Your mother's dead so she can't 
	make any excuses for you anymore! 
	You gotta deal with me! No more sugar 
	tit, asshole.

Wade, redressed, enters:

		WADE
	Pop, for Christ's sake!

		POP
	You think you can take me now? Come 
	on, try.

Margie and Nick guide pere et fils to MARG'S CAR. Nick speaks 
to her:

		NICK
	Marg, get out of this. Fast.

		MARGIE
	I can't.

Marg drives off.

						CUT TO:

INT. MARGIE'S CAR - NIGHT

Wade leans close to his father, his breath on his:

		WADE
	I wish you would die.

Pop spits directly into Wade's face, raises his arm. Wade 
catches it, twists it. Margie shrieks:

		MARGIE
	Stop it! Stop it! Just stop it!

They do, glaring as they approach the farmhouse.

						CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Wade looks in the bedroom, sees Margie sleeping, goes to the 
bathroom.

He peers, stands before the sink, washes his hands slowly. 
Drying his hands, he looks into the mirror, startled by the 
image of his own face.

A phone conversation plays over:

		WADE (O.S.)
	No shit, Rolfe, I glanced up and 
	there he was, only it was me. But it 
	was like I had never seen myself 
	before. It was a stranger's face. 
	Hard to explain. You fly on automatic 
	pilot, like I was doing all night, 
	and you disappear.

						CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Wade sits alone in the darkened room, speaking on the phone. 
His cigarette glows.

		WADE
	Then you accidentally see your body, 
	or your face, or whatever, and you 
	don't know who the hell it belongs 
	to. Strange. It's the business with 
	the old man, I know, and how 
	incredibly pissed I was at him, and 
	also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, 
	and the Goddamned truck going through 
	the ice, not to mention Margie's 
	being so upset -- one thing on top 
	of another.

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	Wade, are you alright?

		WADE
	But you gotta hear this. You won't 
	believe it. Mel Gordon had come by 
	to visit LaRiviere and so now I'm in 
	his office.

						CUT TO:

INT. LARIVIERE'S OFFICE - DAY

Wade's theory expanded: Jack and Gordon argue in the office. 
An extension of Scene 55. Like Wade's other theories, in 
black-and-white:

		LARIVIERE
	He's on to us!

		JACK
	Shit! What are we gonna do?

		LARIVIERE
	Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta 
	talk to Mel.

		JACK
	You can't buy Wade off.

		LARIVIERE
	We bought you.

		JACK
	That was me.

						CUT TO:

EXT. ALMA PITTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY

Wade drives Margie's car toward LaRiviere's. In his rear 
view window he spots Chick Ward driving Chub Merritt's tow 
truck, lights blinking, pulling LaRiviere's pickup like a 
dead fish.

He pulls over, lets it pass. He's parked in front of Alma 
Pittman's house. A sign on the lawn reads, "Alma Pittman, 
Town Clerk."

He looks at the house, decides to go in. Wade walks up the 
shoveled steps, knocks on the door. ALMA, 60, wearing plaid 
shirt and slacks, greets him with a smile:

		ALMA
	Wade! Come in! Have a cup of coffee.

						CUT TO:

INT. ALMA PITTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY

They step into Alma's living room/office. She's been keeping 
the town secrets for as long as anyone can remember.

		WADE
	You got yourself a computer, Alma.

		ALMA
	Been putting my files into it. You 
	take sugar and milk?

		WADE
	No. Black.

They sit by her desk at the bay window. She studies him.

		ALMA
	Are you alright, Wade?

		WADE
	Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned 
	tooth, I got a few things bugging 
	me, like everybody else. But I'm 
	okay.

		ALMA
	Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't 
	mean to pry. I'm sorry about your 
	mother. It was a nice funeral.

		WADE
	Alma, I think there's some dirty 
	business going on in this town.

		ALMA
	Always has been.

		WADE
	This is maybe worse than you and I 
	are used to.
		(beat)
	What I'm talking about, I'm talking 
	about murder. Among other things.

		ALMA
	Who?

		WADE
	Evan Twombley, the union boss who 
	got shot. Somebody murdered him.

		ALMA
	Who?

		WADE
	You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work 
	with?

Wade finishes:

		WADE
	...if Jack told the truth, he could 
	be free by the time he's my age.

		ALMA
	Sometimes things are simpler than 
	you think. Let me ask you a question.

		WADE
	You don't believe me?

		ALMA
		(crosses to her desk)
	About Jack? No. Have you checked out 
	the tax bill on your father's farm 
	lately?

		WADE
	I know he's due for the last two 
	years. I was thinking of paying it 
	when the insurance comes in.

		ALMA
	Has anybody offered to buy it?

		WADE
	As a mater of fact, yes. LaRiviere.

Alma punches her computer. Dozens of items flash up.

		ALMA
	This is all the real estate 
	transactions in this town the last 
	year. Most of it unused land. Most 
	of it for little more than the back 
	taxes owed.

She punches again: only three items.

		ALMA
	This is from three years ago. Some 
	difference, huh?

		WADE
		(looking)
	What is the Northcountry Development 
	Association?

		ALMA
	I went down to Concord to check it 
	out. The president is Mel Gordon. 
	The vice-president and treasurer is 
	Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are 
	buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 
	this year. I believe that's out of 
	LaRiviere's league.

		WADE
	Twombley involved?

		ALMA
	No.

		WADE
	He musta found out. They had to get 
	rid of him. And Jack'll get blamed.

		ALMA
	All the figures show is that Gordon 
	LaRiviere is going to be a very rich 
	man using his position as Selectman. 
	In a year or two, you won't recognize 
	this town.

						CUT TO:

INT. LARIVIERE'S OFFICE - DAY

Wade storms in, shouting. Jack and Jimmy choose donuts by 
the file cabinet. LaRiviere's behind his desk. Wade's tooth 
makes it hard for him to talk without pain:

		WADE
	You sneaky sonofabitch! I've got 
	your number now, Gordon! All these 
	years I actually thought you were a 
	decent man.
		(pounds fists on desk)
	Can you believe that?

Jack, combative, looks at Wade. Gordon stands before Jack 
can speak:

		LARIVIERE
	Wade, you're done.
		(extends hand)
	Let me have the shop keys.

		WADE
		(to Jack and Jimmy)
	You two, don't you get it? He's using 
	you. You're his slaves.
		(soft)
	Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see 
	that?

		LARIVIERE
	The key, Wade.

		WADE
	Yeah, you can have the key. It's the 
	key that's kept me locked to you all 
	these years. I give it to you with 
	pleasure.
		(passes key)
	Now I'm free. See how easy it is, 
	Jack? All you got to do is give back 
	what the man gave you, and you're 
	free of him.
		(turns to leave)
	I've got to call my brother.

Wade's phone conversation plays OVER as he goes to Margie's 
car.

		WADE (O.S.)
	I know what it means. I'm just running 
	out of ways to use it.

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	For what?

						CUT TO:

EXT. ROUTE 29/MERRITT'S - DAY

Phone conversation continues as Wade drives to Merritt's 
Shell station.

		WADE (O.S.)
	To help, Jack, of course -- and to 
	nail those sonsofbitches, the Two 
	Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. 
	Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?

		ROLFE (O.S.)
	Take care of the little things first, 
	the things that are distracting you 
	from taking care of the big things. 
	Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, 
	call a dentist, for God's sake, and 
	get your tooth pulled, don't trust 
	the locals, get your facts straight 
	and go straight to the state police. 
	Let them work on this.

CHICK WARD, 30, Chub Merritt's mechanic, greets Wade outside 
the station. We join their conversation:

		CHICK
	The good news is we haven't got to 
	your car yet. The bad news --

		WADE
	Just tell me when you'll have it 
	fixed.

		CHICK
	-- the bad news is there's a problem 
	with Gordon's truck what somebody 
	drove through the ice last night. 
	Figured you'd know something about 
	that, Wade.

		WADE
		(beat)
	Yeah. I know about that.

		CHICK
	LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay 
	for the fixin' of your car. A couple 
	hundred for the clutch. I got some 
	more bad news. Wanna hear it?

		WADE
	Tell me.

		CHICK
	Chub says you're fired.

		WADE
	He can't fire me. LaRiviere already 
	did that this morning.

		CHICK
	He's a Selectman. The town. He said 
	to tell you to turn your badge in 
	and clean out your office. I'm 
	supposed to pull the CB and police 
	light out of your car. They're town 
	property.

						CUT TO:

INT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY

Wade, open phone book in hand, walks back and forth speaking 
into the receiver. Margie looks up from the KITCHEN table, 
an old newspaper in front of her.

		WADE
	What do you mean, you can't take me 
	today? I told you --

The other party has hung up. Margie stands, upset. Wade slams 
the phone down.

		MARGIE
	What on earth is happening to you? 
	Why are you acting this way?

		WADE
	It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I 
	can't even think anymore because of 
	it.

		MARGIE
	I heard you talking. You got fired 
	this morning, didn't you?

		WADE
	Look, that's temporary, believe me. 
	There's so much shit gonna hit the 
	fan the next few days, my getting 
	fired by LaRiviere and Merritt won't 
	matter a bit.

Pop enters from outside with firewood, passes.

		WADE
	I'll get another job. People are 
	going to need me. After this is over, 
	they'll make me into a Goddamned 
	hero. You wait: you'll see, I'll 
	deliver. I'll be the best father who 
	ever lived. You need me, even Pop, 
	for Christ's sake, he needs me. This 
	town needs me. Maybe now they think 
	they can send me howling into a corner 
	like a kicked dog, but my God, it'll 
	be different soon.

Margie's face falls. She retreats from the room as he speaks, 
taking her coat and pocketbook. Wade and his old man, she 
thinks: just the same.

Wade looks out the window and she gets in her car, drives 
off.

Wade holds his inflamed jaw; he can hardly see straight. Pop 
turns on the TV in the living room, boosts the volume.

Pop comes back in the room, gets the Canadian Club, pours 
himself a drink.

		WADE
	Leave the bottle out!

Pop growls, goes back to wrestling on the TV. Wade walks to 
the cabinet, removes a pair of pliers from the tool drawer, 
goes toward the bathroom.

In the BATHROOM, Wade opens his mouth -- it hurts -- takes a 
bite of whisky, sets the bottle on the toilet tank.

He looks at the stranger in the mirror, reaches inside his 
mouth with the pliers. Prying his mouth open, Wade Whitehouse 
locks the pliers onto a large molar in the back, squeezes 
and pulls.

He steadies himself, pulls again, yanking the pliers from 
his mouth. The bloody rotted tooth clatters in the sink. He 
takes another bite of whisky.

Rolfe's voice plays over:

		ROLFE (V.O.)
	You will say I should have known 
	terrible things were about to happen, 
	and perhaps I should have. But even 
	so, what could I have done by then? 
	Wade never went inside. He lived 
	almost wholly out there on his skin, 
	with no interior space to retreat 
	to, even in a crisis.

Wade takes another swig, sets the whisky bottle in the LIVING 
ROOM beside the TV set. Wade and Pop exchange looks.

Wade exits through the KITCHEN, snatching his coat.

						CUT TO:

EXT. BARN - DAY

Wade spits blood into the snow as he grabs a gallon can of 
gasoline from under the porch.

He crosses to the barn, prepares to pour the gas into the 
beat-up red truck.

						CUT TO:

EXT. CONCORD - DAY

Wade's Ford pickup passes J. Battle Hand's office, keeps 
going. Grass peeks through the snow at this lower altitude.

						CUT TO:

EXT. LILLIAN'S HOUSE - DAY

Wade parks the truck, walks past leafless bushes to a charcoal-
gray split-level with pink shutters. He pushes the door bell; 
the first notes of "Frere Jacques" play.

Lillian opens the door; Jill's footsteps approach.

		LILLIAN
	Wait there. She'll be right out.
		(looks back)
	Is there snow on the ground up in 
	Lawford?

		WADE
	Yeah, lots.

		LILLIAN
		(to Jill)
	See. Get your boots.

		WADE
	Hi honey.

		JILL
		(going back inside)
	Hi.

		LILLIAN
	Have her back tomorrow night by six.

		WADE
	No problem. Look, I...

		LILLIAN
	You make me sick. I can't believe 
	you've sunk so low.

		WADE
	Low as what? What have I done? It's 
	bad to want to see your own daughter?

		LILLIAN
	You know what I'm talking about. For 
	what you're doing to me and to the 
	child you say you love so much. Love. 
	You won't get away with it.

Jill returns, wearing parka and boots, heads out with her 
father.

		LILLIAN
	Bye, honey! Call me tonight if you 
	want.

Wade and Jill approach the truck.

		JILL
	Are we going in this?

		WADE
	Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll 
	be fine.

		JILL
	It's pretty old.

		WADE
	It belongs to Pop.

		JILL
	Pop?

		WADE
	Grandpa. My father. It's his.

		JILL
	Oh.

Wade opens the truck door. Jill climbs in with her overnight 
bag, looks back to the door where Lillian watches.

						CUT TO:

INT./EXT. WADE'S TRUCK - DAY

The Ford heads north.

		WADE
		(winking)
	How about a Big Mac?

		JILL
	Mommy won't let me eat fast food. 
	You know that. It's bad for you.

		WADE
	C'mon, we can always sneak a Big 
	Mac. And a cherry turnover. Your 
	favorite. What do you say?

		JILL
	No.

		WADE
	What do you want, then?

		JILL
	Nothing.

		WADE
	You can't have nothing, Jill. We 
	need lunch. Mr. Pizza?

		JILL
	Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --

		WADE
	I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge 
	today, though.

		JILL
	Okay. So we'll get what you want. 
	What do you want?

They stop for a light. Silence.

		WADE
	Nothing, I guess. I guess I can wait 
	till we get home. Maybe we'll stop 
	by Wickham's for a hamburger when we 
	get to Lawford. That suit you? You 
	always like Wickham's.

		JILL
		(looking ahead)
	Okay.

		WADE
	Fine.

Pause. Wade looks over at Jill and realizes she is crying.

		WADE
	Oh, Jesus, Jill, I'm sorry. What's 
	the matter, honey?

She shoves her clenched fists hard against her legs.

		WADE
	Please don't cry. Please, honey.

		JILL
		(regains composure)
	What are you sorry for?

		WADE
	I don't know. For the food business. 
	I guess. I just thought, you know, 
	we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like 
	we used to.

		JILL
	I want to go home.

		WADE
		(quick)
	You can't.

Jill looks away. Wade pulls a six-pack from under the seat, 
pulls off a beer, takes a swig.

		JILL
		(quiet)
	That's illegal, you know.

		WADE
	I know.

		JILL
	You're a policeman.

		WADE
	Nope. Not anymore. I'm nothing 
	anymore.

		JILL
	Oh.

						CUT TO:

INT. WICKHAM'S - DAY

Wade and Jill enter Wickham's, crowded with out-of-state 
hunters at the end of the deer season.

		WADE
	Jillie, you want a cheese grilled 
	sandwich?

		NICK
	It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, 
	you dub.

Wade, flaring, reaches across the counter and grabs Nick by 
the shirtfront! Nick's arm knocks over a cup of coffee.

The diner goes silent. Hunters look up. Jill's face is white; 
she starts to cry.

Wade looks over -- it takes him a moment to react -- bends 
down, comforting her. He wipes her nose with a napkin.

		WADE
	Jill, please, it's alright. Nothing 
	happened.

		JILL
	I want to go home.

		WADE
		(rigid)
	Okay, let's go home, then.

They head for the door. Nick eases over:

		NICK
		(delicate)
	Wade, I got a message for you.
		(Wade turns)
	Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. 
	Wants you to clear your stuff out of 
	his office in Town Hall.

		WADE
	His office. You mean my old office.

		NICK
	Well, I guess -- that's what he said.

		WADE
	He got his deer yet?

		NICK
	No, he's out now. Somewhere on the 
	mountain. I'd stay away from him if 
	I were you. He's real pissed.

Wade takes Jill's hand, exits.

						CUT TO:

EXT. TOWN HALL - DAY

Jill waits in the old red truck parked outside.

Wade emerges with cardboard boxes of office miscellany, rifles 
laid across top. He shoves the boxes and guns into the back 
of the pickup, gets in and drives off.

						CUT TO:

EXT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY

Wade and Jill pull up the drive, past Margie's car, into the 
barn. Her trunk and two side doors are open.

Margie comes out back with a battered suitcase, goes to her 
car. She's leaving. A plastic bag of clothes sits in the 
trunk.

Wade and Jill get out, approach:

		WADE
	Going somewhere, Margie?

		MARGIE
	I'm just cleaning out some of this 
	stuff that's built up. For the rummage 
	sale. And some things for the 
	cleaners. And the laundromat.

		WADE
	Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, 
	I can see that.

		MARGIE
	Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.

Jill, suitcase in hand, looking pathetic, tries to smile. A 
sadness passes over Wade's face.

		WADE
		(hurt)
	Marg.

Margie, watching him, quivers, starts to cry. She drops her 
suitcase, out of nowhere bawling like a baby.

Wade goes over, puts his arms around her, pats her back. His 
face is racked. He, too, seems about to cry -- if he could.

In his arms Margie feels trapped, overwhelmed by Wade's 
circumstances and terrible sadness. She pushes:

		MARGIE
		(crying)
	Leave me alone! Leave me alone!

She struggles in Wade's grasp. Jill, frightened, wildly hits 
him from behind:

		JILL
	Leave her alone! Leave her alone!

Wade moves back like a bear, covering his face and arms. 
Jill, near hysterical, keeps after him, arms and fists flying.

Wade stumbles backwards into the snow. Jill still swings. 
Margie dashes to intervene as Wade swings his arms wide.

Jill flies into Marg. Her nose is bleeding. Wade's caught 
her across the mouth and nose. She takes cover behind Margie, 
crying.

Margie and Jill stand side by side, saying nothing. Wade 
looks up stunned, as if hit by a rock. Marg slowly backs 
away, her arms behind her holding Jill.

		MARGIE
		(to Jill)
	Get in.

Marg eases Jill into the front seat, closes the door, edges 
around the car slamming the trunk and gets into the driver's 
seat. Wade stands.

		JILL
	I want to go home. Will you take me 
	home?

		MARGIE
	Yes.

She closes the front door, starts the car. She backs out the 
drive.

In her rear view mirror she sees the image of Wade receding, 
standing frozen, staring down at the snow. Pop emerges from 
the house, looks at his son, grinning.

Wade looks at his old man, that dumb devilish grin plastered 
on his father's face. Glen Whitehouse holds an empty whiskey 
bottle like a pistol.

Hunters' gunshots echo in the distance.

		POP
		(Satanic delight)
	You! By Christ, you -- I know you.
		(points bottle)
	Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I 
	know you. You're a goddamn fucking 
	piece of my heart!

		WADE
		(dead)
	You don't know me. You don't know 
	me!
		(beat)
	So fuck you. Fuck you.

		POP
	Nah-nah-naw! You done done finally 
	done it! Like a man done it. Done it 
	right. I love you, you mean 
	sonofabitch!

Pop holds up the bottle, pretends to fire it at Wade.

		WADE
	Love! What the fuck do you know about 
	love?

		POP
	Love! I'm made of love!

		WADE
	Call it what you want.

		POP
	Everything you know is from me.

		WADE
	Yeah.

		POP
	Bang!

		WADE
	You and me.

Wade waves his old man off, trudges toward the barn.

		POP
	Where the Christ you going? You 
	sonofabitch, you leave my fucking 
	truck where it is! I need... Give me 
	the Goddamn keys! I need to get me 
	to town!

		WADE
	Crawl!

		POP
	Nothing in the fucking house to drink. 
	Not a fucking thing. My house, my 
	money, my truck -- stolen!

		WADE
	I don't know you. My goddamn father 
	and I don't know you.

Wade walks from the glistening snow into the dark barn.

						CUT TO:

INT. BARN - DAY

Wade unloads the cardboard boxes filled with his office 
belongings from the back of the truck and sets them on the 
ground. He gathers up his rifles.

Suddenly! A whiskey bottle SLAMS against the back of his 
head. He drops to his knees, the guns scatter. He looks up 
with child's fear and guilt at his father.

Glen Whitehouse hovers over him, huge and ferocious: a 
colossus, lifting the bottle like a jawbone.

Wade cringes, scrambles for the dropped rifle. He grabs it 
by the barrel and, twisting around, swings it in a slow motion 
arc, smashing the edge of the wood stock against his father's 
head. A cold hard CRACK of bone.

Glen Whitehouse -- shriveled again, no longer mythic -- flies 
back like a stuffed dummy. He collapses beside the empty 
C.C. bottle.

Wade, bleeding from the head, stands, staggers off Pop's 
inert body, aims his rifle at the old man's face.

		WADE
	I know you now. I love you too.

Wade bolts the rifle, flicks off the safety, fires -- a loud 
CLICK. The gun's empty.

		WADE
		(smiles)
	Joke. You scared me.

He kneels down, lovingly touches the old man's face, caresses 
his lips, cheeks, nose, brows, smoothes back his stiff gray 
hair.

Pop's eyes are clouded. Blood suddenly drips from his ear to 
the ground.

Wade rests the rifle against the truck. He bends over, slips 
his hands under his father's body, lifts him up. He carries 
Pop over to the workbench, lays him out.

Groping beneath the bench, Wade finds the kerosene lamp. He 
unscrews it, pours kerosene the length of Pop's body.

Wade takes out his cigarette lighter, ignites it, holds it 
for a moment, places it to Glen Whitehouse.

Fire spreads the length of Pop's body, bursting like a shroud 
of yellow flame. The oil-stained bench crackles; flames shoot 
up the old weathered wall.

Burning flesh and heat drive Wade backwards.

						CUT TO:

EXT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY

Wade stands in snow and sunlight. The entire barn is engulfed 
in flames. Black smoke billows through the clear winter sky. 
Inside Glen Whitehouse, a pyre, burns.

		ROLFE (V.O.)
	The historical facts are known by 
	everyone -- all of Lawford, all of 
	New Hampshire, some of Massachusetts. 
	Facts do not make history. Our 
	stories, Wade's and mine, describe 
	the lives of boys and men for 
	thousands of years, boys who were 
	beaten by their fathers, whose 
	capacity for love and trust was 
	crippled almost at birth and whose 
	best hope, if any, for connection 
	with other human beings lay in an 
	elegiac detachment, as if life were 
	over.

						CUT TO:

EXT. PARKER MOUNTAIN - DAY

Pop's red truck is parked behind Jack Hewitt's 4x4 on a snow-
banked road. Wade, hunting rifle pointed up, traces Jack's 
footsteps down the slope of the mountain.

		ROLFE (V.O.)
	It's how we keep from destroying in 
	turn our own children and terrorizing 
	the women who have the misfortune to 
	love us; how we absent ourselves 
	from the tradition of male violence; 
	how we decline the seduction of 
	revenge.

Wade spots Jack poised in a spruce grove, watching for deer. 
Wade bolts his rifle, releases the safety, aims and FIRES.

Jack, hit in the chest, falls bleeding between trees. Blood 
stains the snow.

		ROLFE (V.O.)
	Jack's truck turned up three days 
	later in a shopping mall in Toronto. 
	Even without the footprints, the 
	bullet, Wade's utter disappearance 
	seemed evidence enough of his guilt.

						CUT TO:

INT. WHITEHOUSE FARM - DAY

Camera glides from room to room, glimpsing details, fragments 
of former times, as if this were an historical site or 
memorial. The walls resonate: lives were molded here.

		ROLFE (V.O.)
	LaRiviere and Mel Gordon were indeed 
	in business. The Parker Mountain Ski 
	Resort is now advertised all across 
	the country. Jimmy Dame tends bar at 
	the lodge. Chub Merritt opened a 
	snowmobile dealership, Nick Wickham 
	runs the new Burger King. Margie 
	Fogg moved to Littleton, nearer her 
	mother; Lillian and Jill went with 
	Bob Horner to a new job in Seattle.

Out a window, workers gather charred timbers from the barn, 
throw them on a truck.

		ROLFE (V.O.)
	We want to believe Wade died, died 
	that same November, froze to death 
	on a bench or a sidewalk. You cannot 
	understand how a man, a normal man, 
	a man like you and me, could do such 
	a terrible thing. Unless the police 
	happen to arrest a vagrant who turns 
	out to be Wade Whitehouse -- or maybe 
	he won't be a vagrant; maybe he will 
	have turned himself into one of those 
	faceless fellows working at the video 
	store and lives in a town-house 
	apartment at the edge of town until 
	his mailman recognizes him from the 
	picture at the post office -- unless 
	that happens, there will be no more 
	mention of him and his friend Jack 
	Hewitt and our father. The story 
	will be over. Except that I continue.
