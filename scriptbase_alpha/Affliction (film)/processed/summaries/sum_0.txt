His girlfriend Margie accepts him the way he is.
On the first day of the hunting season, Wade's friend Jack takes a wealthy businessman to hunt - and only Jack returns alive.
Wade decides to play detective and starts investigating the case despite the fact Jack insists it was an accidental self-inflicted shot.
