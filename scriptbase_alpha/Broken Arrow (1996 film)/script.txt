                                                          FOURTH DRAFT
                                                         March 7, 1995

          

          

          FADE IN:

          A FIST HITS A FACE
          The fist is in a boxing glove. It belongs to VIC DEAKINS, 38.
          The face belongs to RAWLEY HALE, 28. They are in...

          INT. GYMNASIUM, WHITEMAN AFB - DAY

          Hale and Deakins are sparring in a ring. Other people are
          lifting weights, shooting baskets.

          IN THE RING
          Hale and Deakins circle each other. Hale is shaking cobwebs out
          of his head.

          DEAKINS
          You know what happened there?

          HALE
          Hell, I barely know what day it is.

          DEAKINS
          I set you up. I fake right, go
          left three times in a row. You
          expect it again, I take the right
          in hard. That's what boxing's all
          about. Make your opponent think
          you're gonna do one thing, then do
          another. Like Ali in Zaire, using
          the rope-a-dope on Foreman.
          (mimes rope-a-dope)
          Everyone thought Ali's arms were
          getting destroyed, when he was
          really just letting Foreman tire
          himself out. Eighth round, Ali
          starts hitting, George's got
          nothing left -- fight's over.

          HALE
          The fact that I can't feel the
          left side of my face -- that's
          okay, right?
          Deakins laughs. Hale seizes the relaxed moment and suddenly
          launches into Deakins with a flurry of punches.

          THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GYM
          Take notice -- the fight is getting real. They move to the ring.

          DEAKINS
          Several of Hale's punches land. Deakins staggers back, caught
          off guard. It looks like he might even go down.

          

          

          

          

           2.

          HALE
          He cocks his arm back. He could finish Deakins off. But he
          doesn't. He drops his fist.

          DEAKINS
          Seizes the opportunity and slugs back.

          THE CROWD
          Loves it.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Now Deakins has the upperhand. He backs Hale around the ring.

          DEAKINS
          Don't watch my hands -- watch my
          shoulders. That's where the punch
          starts. Ready?
          Deakins hits Hale hard in the face, sending him back.

          THE SPECTATORS
          Are circling the ring, following the fighters, cheering.

          HALE AND DEAKINS

          DEAKINS
          You were looking at my hands.
          Let's try it again. Ready?
          Deakins hits Hale hard. He's got Hale on the run.

          DEAKINS
          Come on. Focus. Ready?

          (PUNCH)
          My shoulders. Ready?
          Deakins fakes left, puts everything into one big uppercut. It
          connects.

          HALE
          Lands, dazed, blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth.

          DEAKINS
          He's in silhouette, the lights above him.

          HALE
          Looks up at Deakins, catches his breath.

          

          

          

          

           3.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Deakins offers his hand. Hale pushes it aside. Deakins ignores
          Hale, grabs him and helps him to his feet. Deakins climbs out
          of the ring between the ropes.
          Hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over, landing on his
          feet. Deakins gives Hale a look, laughs, shakes his head.

          INT. SHOWERS

          Hale lets the water rinse the blood off his face.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          Hale and Deakins are sitting on the bench between their lockers,
          getting into their flightsuits, pulling on boots. Deakins is
          smoking a cigarette. The smoke curls up into the light slanting
          down across the room from high windows.

          HALE'S LOCKER
          Is in sunlight. On the inside of his locker door are pictures
          of exotic planes -- the SR-71, a swept-wing fighter, an artist's
          rendition of the Aurora, etc.

          DEAKINS' LOCKER
          On the shady side of the room. Nothing on the inside of his
          locker door. The locker is spare, Zen-like in its neatness.

          HALE
          Here.

          HALE'S HAND
          Slams a twenty dollar bill down on the bench.

          DEAKINS
          I can't take that.

          HALE
          Oh, shut up.

          DEAKINS
          Really. I feel bad. How many times
          have we fought and how many times
          have you won?

          HALE
          Jerk.

          DEAKINS
          Well, if you insist.
          Deakins grins, folds the bill and jams it into his flightsuit.

          

          

          

          

           4.

          DEAKINS
          You know why I beat you?

          HALE
          Because you've been boxing for
          twenty years and you're much
          better at it than I am?

          DEAKINS
          You don't want it enough. You had
          me today. I was back on my heels.
          But you didn't close the door.

          HALE
          We were just sparring.

          DEAKINS
          Life isn't sparring, Hale.

          HALE
          I think I saw that on a T-shirt.
          Deakins pulls out the twenty dollar bill; hands it back to Hale.

          DEAKINS
          Here.

          HALE
          No, that's yours.

          DEAKINS
          If you weren't giving it
          everything you've got, then I
          don't want it.

          HALE
          No, I mean -- that's yours,
          literally. I took it out of your
          wallet when you were in the shower.
          Deakins laughs, puts the money away.

          EXT. WHITEMAN AIR FORCE BASE - DUSK

          Planes taxiing, vehicles moving.

          INT. WHITEMAN MISSION BRIEFING ROOM

          Deakins and Hale enter to find GENERAL BOONE, 50s.

          DEAKINS/HALE
          General.

          

          

          

          

           5.

          BOONE
          Gentlemen.
          (nods at NO SMOKING

          SIGN)
          Deak?

          DEAKINS
          Sorry.
          (puts out cigarette)
          What's the mission, General?

          BOONE
          Simulate a border penetration. Hug
          the ground. Scare some cows. See
          if anyone can spot you.

          HALE
          The usual ...?

          BOONE
          No, actually, it's a little
          unusual. You're carrying a couple
          of nukes tonight, fellas.
          (off their looks)
          Palmdale's afraid low-level gamma
          and x-ray diffusion might screw up
          the peripherals. They asked us to
          send a couple on a run, see if
          anything glows.

          HALE
          '61s?

          BOONE
          (shakes head)
          Big ones. '83s.

          HALE
          Ooh. Crowpleasers.

          INT. HANGAR

          A BOMB TRUCK carrying two B-83 nuclear weapons drives under the
          wing of a big, black plane, toward the open bomb bays. GROUND
          CREWMEN are hurrying about.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Enter and walk under the plane, nodding to the ground crew. Hale
          and Deakins are royalty. Deakins and Hale climb up the
          airplane's Crew Entry steps and disappear.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Hale and Deakins climb into a very strange cockpit. There are
          two pilots' seats in this plane, with duplicate controls.

          

          

          

          

           6.
          But instead of the usual dials and gauges on the control panels,
          there are FOUR COMPUTER SCREENS in front of each pilot. Hale
          gets into the left seat; Deakins the right. They review
          information on their screens, flip switches.

          INTERCUT WITH BOMBS
          Being loaded into the bomb bays. When they've been clamped into
          place in the rotary bomb racks...

          DEAKINS
          (into helmet mike)
          Ready for rollout.

          INT./EXT. HANGAR

          Alarm horns sound, wheels roll on track and the huge hangar
          doors open revealing...

          THE GHOST
          An enormous black flying wing.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins looks at maps on his computer screens. Hale looks over,
          sees the map of Utah.

          HALE
          You know, these exercises are
          fantastic. I mean, when that day
          comes and we finally go to war
          against Utah, we are really going
          to kick ass.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT

          Bright moonlight shows a campfire burning at the edge of an
          escarpment, the Colorado River a thousand feet below. Near the
          campfire is an Army surplus tent. Next to it, an easel holds a
          painting in progress.

          A PARK RANGER TRUCK
          Drives up, stops. The driver's door open, and out gets...

          A RANGER
          We don't see his face in the dark. He switches on a flashlight,
          walks over and taps on the tent.

          RANGER
          Park Ranger. I'd like to talk to
          somebody about this fire.

          

          

          

          

           7.
          We hear a man and a woman -- JIM and WANDA, 60s -- wake up.

          JIM (O.S.)
          Wha--? Oh, hell.

          WANDA (O.S.)
          I'll talk to him, Jim.

          JIM (O.S.)
          Wanda, you stay put.
          Jim comes out of the tent, the ranger's light in his face.

          JIM
          I know -- no wood fires in the
          Park. It's just -- Wanda's got a
          cold and I wanted her to stay warm.

          RANGER
          Sir, you see any other hikers,
          campers anywhere around here?

          JIM
          Not this time of year. What's the
          fine for something like this?

          RANGER
          Your life.
          Jim grins. But the ranger pulls out a pistol and shoots Jim,
          who falls into the fire. He then puts three shots through the
          wall of the tent. Nothing moves. The Ranger -- call him
          BAKER -- pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on.

          BAKER
          Done.

          HEADLIGHTS
          Come on and two Humvees roll in and four men get out. Three of
          them -- JOHNSON, a tech-whiz; LETT, gangly, grim, and NOVACEK,
          a wiry guy in a baseball cap -- start setting up what looks to
          be a high-tech missile launcher. The fourth man is...

          MR. PRITCHETT
          A neatly groomed man, 40s, with a perpetually sour attitude. He
          looks like -- and is -- a lawyer.

          PRITCHETT
          (to Baker, re: Jim in

          FIRE)
          Jesus. Do you think maybe you
          could get him out of the fire?
          Unless you like that smell.

          

          

          

          

           8.

          EXT. THE NIGHT SKY

          The Ghost flies overhead, roaring.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins and Hale check their screens.

          DEAKINS
          (thinks of something)
          Weren't you going to call Taylor
          today about the Aurora Project?

          HALE
          Yeah. Turns out he wants people
          with more fighter hours.

          DEAKINS
          What'd you say?

          HALE
          What could I say?

          DEAKINS
          Jesus. You are such a pussy. You
          never fight for anything.
          Hale is stung. Pissed, he goes on the offensive.

          HALE
          Yeah, well you know what your
          problem is?

          DEAKINS
          Because I said what your problem
          is, you're gonna--?

          HALE
          You fight too much.
          (Deakins look at him)
          Right? You said it yourself --
          you should be at least Wing
          Commander by now. Maybe you would
          be if you didn't insist on telling
          people what they're doing wrong
          all the time.

          DEAKINS
          I'm usually right though, aren't I?
          Hale shakes his head, grins. Deakins clicks on his mike.

          DEAKINS
          Ghost 7 to McMurran. Hey,
          Wilkins, you old bag of dirt, your
          boys in Utah still awake?

          

          

          

          

           9.

          EXT. MCMURRAN AIR FORCE BASE - UTAH

          Establishing shot of McMurran Air Force Base.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Jammed with MEN looking at radar screens and computer monitors.
          COLONEL WILKINS, 50s, seen it all, talks over a headset.

          WILKINS
          Ready and waiting, Mr. Deakins.
          And tell our favorite hotshot,
          he's not gonna lose us tonight.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins covers his mike, turns to Hale.

          DEAKINS
          Wilkins says you won't lose them
          tonight.

          HALE
          Tell Colonel Wilkins I could fly
          this puppy up his ass without him
          knowing.

          DEAKINS
          (grins, shakes his
          head; into helmet

          MIKE)
          Hale says ... if anyone can catch
          him it'd be you.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER


          CU RADAR SCREEN
          The Ghost makes a prominent blip on the screen.

          WILKINS
          Everyone get a fix! They're about
          to turn out the lights!

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins turns to Hale.

          DEAKINS
          Ready, Major?

          HALE
          On your word.

          DEAKINS
          Go to war.

          

          

          

          

           10.

          CLOSE ON CONTROL PANEL - THREE BUTTONS
          The left, labeled TAKE OFF, is lighted. The other two buttons
          are MISSION and LANDING. Hale pushes MISSION.

          THE COCKPIT
          everything goes quiet.

          EXT. NIGHT SKY

          The plane's running lights go out. The roar of the engines
          quickly drops to a low rushing sound. The plane in in full
          stealth mode.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER


          CU RADAR SCREEN
          The Ghost's blip disappears.

          WILKINS
          Lost 'em on active! Who's still
          got 'em?

          IR CREWMAN
          Got their heat signature, sir.
          (points to computer

          SCREEN)
          Their engines may be cold, but the
          air is colder.

          CU COMPUTER SCREEN
          Half of the screen shows a waveform, like a voiceprint. The
          other half shows a triangle moving across a map of Colorado.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins studies the maps on the computer screens.

          DEAKINS
          Descend to 400 feet AGL. River
          valley approach.

          HALE
          Airspeed lock at point-seven Mach.
          Blue line descent on throttle to
          400 feet AGL.
          Hale pulls back on the throttle. The plane descends.

          HALE
          Time to limbo down. How low can
          we go.

          

          

          

          

           11.

          EXT. NIGHT SKY

          The Ghost drops away from us, a stark black cut-out against the
          moonlit Colorado landscape. The Colorado River is a winding
          silver ribbon five miles below.

          EXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT


          A PARK RANGER TRUCK
          Driving along the blacktop. The driver is not Baker. It's...

          TERRY CARMICHAEL
          Pretty, late 20s. Her radio squawks.

          CLYDE (V.0.)
          Terry? You been through the
          Needles entrance tonight?

          TERRY
          (grabs mike, answers)
          No. Why?

          CLYDE (V.0.)
          Mrs. Parker called --

          TERRY
          Oh, God. What is it this time?
          UFO abduction? Ritual human
          sacrifice?

          CLYDE (V.0.)
          She said she saw a bunch of trucks
          going through the Needles entrance
          an hour ago and thought they
          looked suspicious.

          TERRY
          Yes, well, this is a woman who
          chopped off one of her own fingers
          because it'd "turned on her."

          CLYDE (V.0.)
          Thing is, she said one of the
          trucks was ours, and you're the
          only one out.

          TERRY
          (arches eyebrow)
          She was probably hallucinating,
          but I'll check it out.

          EXT. COLORADO RIVER VALLEY - THIRTY MILES UP RIVER

          We feel the Ghost before we hear it. It rushes over, close to
          the river, below the ridgelines on either side of the valley.

          

          

          

          

           12.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          The triangle representing the Ghost disappears from a computer
          screen.

          IR CREWMAN
          Lost 'em.

          WILKINS
          Stay on it. They're gonna have to
          come up for air sooner or later.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins reads his computer screens.

          DEAKINS
          We're under the radar. Proceed to
          primary target.
          Hale hits a button, lets go of the stick -- they're on
          autopilot. It's a moment of peace. Hale looks out.

          HALE
          I tell people I became a pilot
          because I wanted to fly cool
          planes. It's also for this. When
          we're up here, I feel... closer
          ... I don't know.

          DEAKINS
          To God? Is that what you're going
          to say? That you feel closer to
          God up here?

          (SNORTS)
          Hell, Hale, with the payload we're
          carrying, we are God.
          Deakins notices something odd on his screen. He checks between
          the screen and what he can see through the windshield.

          DEAKINS
          Hale, take a look out your side.
          I think our terrain following is
          off. It's got us two klicks from
          the left flank ridge.
          Hale turns to look out the window on his side.

          HALE'S POV
          Looking out the window. There's some movement in the reflection
          in the glass. QUICK PULL FOCUS to see, distorted in the curve
          of the window, Deakins reaching inside his flight suit.

          

          

          

          

           13.

          HALE
          Turns his head back toward Deakins.

          HALE
          Deak, you can't smoke in here --
          But then Hale sees it's not a cigarette that Deakins is pulling
          out of his flight suit. It's shiny, metal. It's...

          A GUN
          And Deakins levels it right at Hale's head and his finger starts
          to squeeze the trigger.

          HALE
          Grabs Deakins' hand, pushing up as...

          DEAKINS
          Pulls the trigger and the gun FIRES.

          HALE
          The bullet cuts a line through the top of his helmet, punching
          a hole in the window by his head.

          DEAKINS AND HALE
          Deakins goes for another shot, but Hale grabs the gun and pushes
          up, sending bullets through the ceiling of the plane, into the
          walls. Deakins forces the gun down, fires.

          THE BULLET
          Tears through Hale's harness, blowing apart a shoulder strap.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Hale brings Deakins' gun hand hard against Hale's own helmet.
          Deakins yowls and the gun goes flying. Then Hale sees something.

          THE PLANE
          Is banking towards a ridge-line cliff wall.

          HALE
          Sees it, yanks on the stick.

          THE PLANE
          Banks hard away from the cliff, just missing.

          

          

          

          

           14.

          EXT. CANYONLANDS

          Baker gives a sign. Johnson, standing beside the missile
          launcher-like device, hits a button. Instead of a missile, a
          brilliant light shoots out.

          INT. COCKPIT


          ARMAMENTS CONTROL BUTTONS
          Buttons include ONE, TWO, LOCK, LEFT, RIGHT, OPEN, CLOSE, ARM
          and RELEASE. Deakins presses ONE and TWO, then RIGHT.

          HALE
          No!
          He pulls at Deakins' arms.

          CU COMPUTER SCREENS
          Graphics of bomb racks rotate, the B-83 nukes -- labeled and
          glowing red -- move into the bottom spot. The word RELEASE
          appears on the screen. Next to it, the word UNARMED flashes.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Deakins hits Hale with the back of his hand, knocking him back.
          Hale grabs Deakins' helmet, yanks it off his head and smashes
          Deakins back with it. Hale keys the armament buttons.

          CU COMPUTER SCREENS
          The nukes rotate out of the release position. RELEASE and
          UNARMED disappear.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Deakins grabs a fire extinguisher, swings it, getting Hale in
          the face. Hale is almost knocked out, blood running from his
          nose.

          EXT. PARK - NEEDLES AREA

          Terry is standing by her truck, talking on the radio.

          TERRY
          Clyde, tell Mrs. Parker that
          there's nothing weird going on. No
          truck, no UFOs, and, except for
          the odd human head on a stick, no
          sign of Satan.
          She feels it before she hears it or sees it.

          

          

          

          

           15.

          THE GHOST
          Rushes over Terry, no more than fifty feet above the ground. The
          jet-wash rocks the truck, almost knocks Terry down.

          TERRY
          Holy shit.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Hale groggy, hears a loud click. He looks down to see...

          DEAKINS' HAND
          AUTO to MANUAL. Deakins grabs Hale's EJECTION HANDLE.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Hale tries to push the handle down as Deakins pulls it up as...

          EXT. THE GHOST

          Heads into the beacon light.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Hale and Deakins look at each other as the plane enters the
          light and the light, in SLOW MOTION, washes across their faces.

          DEAKINS
          Suddenly lets go of Hale's hand, then hits Hale hard under the
          chin with the fire extinguisher.

          HALE
          His head snaps back as Deakins pulls.

          HALE'S EJECTION SEAT HANDLE
          Pop, hiss like a huge vacuum-sealed can is being opened.

          EXT. ABOVE GHOST

          The ejection hatch blows and is ripped away by the wind.

          HALE'S POV
          As he rockets up out of the cockpit.

          HALE
          When the chute opens, he almost spills out because of the
          severed shoulder harness. He grabs the straps, holds on.

          

          

          

          

           16.

          EXT. ON THE GROUND

          Terry, on the radio with Clyde.

          TERRY
          Somebody ejected!

          INT. COCKPIT

          Debris -- coffee cups, flight bags, anything not nailed down --
          is whipping around the inside of the cabin. Deakins reaches
          through the maelstrom, then reaches to the ARMAMENT BUTTONS and
          punches them.

          INT. BOMB BAYS

          The the clamps snap back and the two B-83s drop toward the earth.

          INT. COCKPIT

          Deakins looks around, then gets an idea. He hits the LANDING
          mission mode button and the cockpit lights up.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          The Ghost starts popping up on everyone's screens. There's a
          chorus of "I got em!" and "They're ba-a-a-ck!" Wilkins looks at
          a screen, puzzled.

          WILKINS
          They're not due for another
          halfhour.

          INT. GHOST COCKPIT

          Deakins yells into his helmet mike as he gets ready to eject.

          DEAKINS
          (into helmet mike)
          This is Deakins! Hale lost it!
          I have to punch out!
          Deakins pulls his second handle. BLAM! WHOOSH! He's gone. He
          hear and feel the plane dropping, screaming toward the earth.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER


          CU RADAR SCREEN
          The Ghost's blip suddenly disappears from the screen. A chorus
          of "What the hell?" and "Jesus."

          WILKINS
          That's not good.

          

          

          

          

           17.

          EXT. MCMURRAN RUNWAY

          Alarm horns blare. FIVE MEN are running to a waiting Blackhawk
          helicopter. Waving the men on is Wilkins. The last man up is...

          LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAM RHODES
          40s, short grey hair: he could snap your neck with a look.
          Wilkins pats Rhodes on the shoulder and Rhodes jumps into...

          THE HELICOPTER
          And it lifts up and flies off.

          EXT. CANYONLANDS

          Hale lies, unconscious, his parachute whipping in the wind.

          INT./EXT. SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER/DESERT

          The helicopter glides over wind-whipped sand, searchlights on.
          Rhodes sits with MCKELLAR, the pilot. Lieutenants KELLY, REED
          and THOMAS are in the back.

          IN THE SAND
          Something glints in the searchlights but the helicopter moves on.

          RHODES
          Hold it. Come back.
          The lights sweep back, find...

          THE TIP OF BLACK WING
          Sticking out of the sand.

          INT. PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM

          AKA "The War Room." Phones, faxes, computers, TV monitors,
          backlit maps and coffee. Present are GENERALS (including Air
          Force General CREELEY), the CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF
          STAFF (CHAIRMAN) and ASSISTANTS, all in uniform. They turn as...

          BAIRD
          Enters. Baird, 60s, is the White House Chief of Staff. His
          assistant stays in the b.g. as Baird walks in.

          

          

          

          

           18.

          BAIRD
          So, do I wake the President?

          CHAIRMAN
          Where is he -- Las Vegas?

          BAIRD

          (NODS)
          Computer convention. Some
          information superhighway crap.

          CHAIRMAN
          Let him sleep for now.
          (hands Baird a piece
          of paper)
          We're going out with this. Rick's
          team prepared it.
          The chairman nods toward RICK. Baird reads, mumbling.

          BAIRD
          "United States Air Force ...
          regrets to announce ... C-130
          heavy-lift cargo plane ... down
          over the Utah desert ... status of
          crew not determined at this time
          ... yadda yadda ... Nice bullshit,
          Rick.
          Baird hands it to Rick, who starts for the door.

          GILES (O.S.)
          That's a mistake.
          The room quiets. All eyes on...

          GILES
          Baird's intensely competent assistant.

          BAIRD
          Giles ...?

          GILES
          Aviation Week has been following
          this plane's development for
          years. They have stringers who
          spend their vacations sitting in
          lawnchairs all night long by the
          Whiteman perimeter fence just in
          case one of these things takes
          off. The boys in those lawnchairs
          know one took off tonight. They're
          going to know when it doesn't come
          back.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

           19.
          GILES (cont'd)
          And when we put out a press
          release saying a C-130 went down
          in Utah, they're going to put two
          and two together. Aviation week
          will run a story, everyone'll know
          what really happened and we're
          going to look real stupid.

          (BEAT)
          We might as well tell the truth.

          BAIRD
          (mock shock)
          The truth? How the hell did you
          get this job?
          A few chuckles in the room. Baird looks at the Chairman --
          well? The Chairman thinks for a second, nods. Baird turns to
          Rick.

          BAIRD
          Rewrite it. What Giles just said.
          Rick grits his teeth and hurries out. Baird looks at Giles.

          BAIRD
          I want you in Utah. Now.
          Giles nods, heads out. Baird grabs his arm.

          BAIRD
          You scare me sometimes.

          GILES
          Hell, sir. Sometimes I scare
          myself.
          And out Giles goes.

          EXT. GHOST CRASH SITE

          Rhodes and his men are on the ground. Wind is whipping the
          sand. Rhodes is walking under part of the wing that is exposed.
          He's yelling into a headset microphone.

          RHODES

          EXT. GHOST CRASH SITE

          Rhodes walks up to his men who are in the process of opening the

          signals his men to stop. Rhodes steps up, shines a light into
          the bomb bays.

          We've got ourselves a Broken Arrow.

          INT.PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM

          Stunned silence. They've just gotten the news. Baird doesn't
          know what it means.

          BAIRD
          Broken Arrow?

          CHAIRMAN
          That's what we call it when we
          lose a nuclear weapon.

          BAIRD
          Oh, Jesus.
          (thinks, shakes head)
          I don't know what's scarier --
          losing nuclear weapons or the fact
          that it happens so often that you
          people have a term for it.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Wilkins is on the radio with Rhodes.

          WILKINS
          Find the nukes, Sam. But be
          careful. I know they say those
          eggs can't be cracked, but if your
          geigers pick up more rads than
          you'd get off a toaster, I want
          you out of there.
          Wilkins to the CORPORAL.

          WILKINS
          Get the teams in. I want Colonel
          Rhodes and his men backed up.

          Various views of a B-83 nuclear weapon. Creeley is briefing
          Baird on the nukes.

          BAIRD
          They dropped from a plane but they
          didn't go off...?

          CREELEY
          They have to be armed to detonate.

          BAIRD
          Then they're destroyed?

          CREELEY
          (shakes head)
          They're designed to survive
          crashes intact. They can lie in
          a pool of burning jet fuel for
          five hours without any problem.

          BAIRD
          How did this happen?

          CREELEY
          In his last transmission, Colonel
          Deakins said Major Hale lost
          control. He probably hit weapons
          release by accident. Believe me,
          when a plane's auguring in, you
          start pushing every button you can.
          Baird stands, looks at a picture of a Ghost shakes his head.

          BAIRD
          Hell, we should take the cost of
          the plane out of major Hale's
          salary. Although I guess at two
          billion dollars a pop, that could
          take a while.

          EXT. CANYONLANDS - DAWN

          Hale is still unconscious, lying beside his parachute. There's
          the crunch of footsteps and a FIGURE looms over Hale. The figure
          reaches down to touch Hale's shoulder and...

          HALE
          Spins, grabs the shirt of the figure and cocks his arm about to
          punch. He hesitates when he sees it's...

          

          

          

          

           22.

          TERRY
          She seizes Hale's hesitation and punches him hard.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Hale is stunned. Terry starts to get up, reaching for her gun.
          Hale strikes out with a leg, getting Terry in the gut, sending
          her back. She hits the ground, still struggling for her gun.
          Hale gets up, runs, sprinting off over the rocky terrain.

          HIS POV
          Jarring, racing over rock and then...

          HALE
          Pulls up fast, almost not fast enough.

          HALE'S POV
          He's stopped right at the edge of a fifty foot drop.

          TERRY (O.S.)
          That would be the wrong way.

          TERRY
          Is walking slowly, calmy, up behind Hale, pistol out.

          TERRY
          Turn around.

          HALE

          (TURNING)
          Look, I --

          TERRY
          (not interested)
          Gimme your hands.
          Hale sticks his hands behind him. Terry handcuffs them.

          HALE
          I'm going to tell you something I
          can't tell you.
          Terry puts away her gun, spins Hale around and starts marching
          him off.

          HALE
          There were nuclear weapons on that
          plane. The guy I was flying with
          is trying to steal them.
          Terry reacts to that, but keeps Hale moving.

          

          

          

          

           23.

          HALE
          I have to stop him, and I need
          your help.

          TERRY

          (STOPS)
          Look, pal, all I know is, I saw
          you come down, I come in to help
          you and you grab me, kick me and
          run away.

          HALE
          I only ran because you punched me.

          TERRY
          What, we're ten years old now?
          "You started it. No you started
          it."

          HALE
          He has men on the ground. I --

          TERRY
          Save it. My dog's waiting for his
          breakfast.
          Terry starts to push Hale along again and...

          HALE
          Jumps up and through the handcuffs.

          TERRY
          Reaches for her revolver, but...

          HALE
          Grabs it from her, puts it to-her head, but not before...

          TERRY
          Whips a knife from her belt and puts it under Hale's chin.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Don't move. A beat while they catch their breath.

          HALE
          This isn't a stand-off, okay? I've
          got a gun.

          TERRY
          Yeah, well, I never keep my gun
          loaded.
          Terry taps her belt.

          

          

          

          

           24.

          CLOSE ON HER BELT
          A line of bullets.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Terry holds out her hand. Hale lets the revolver swing down on
          his finger. Just as Terry takes it...

          HALE
          Moves fast, grabs Terry's knife hand, then kicks her legs out
          from under her. Hale lands on top of her, still holding her
          knife hand, putting the knife to her throat.

          HALE
          I'm telling you the truth.

          TERRY
          This is a good way to convince me.

          HALE
          I could kill you now. Right?
          Terry nods, bewildered and more than a little scared.
          Hale lets go of Terry's hand holding the knife.

          HALE
          I need your help.
          Terry looks at Hale for a long moment. She's still holding the
          knife. She exhales, then sticks the knife in the dirt.

          INT./EXT. HELICOPTER

          The helicopter flies low. Rhodes looks at a device on his lap.

          ON THE DEVICE'S SCREEN
          Green, like a radar screen. It's blank, and then two dots
          appear on the outer edge of the screen.

          RHODES
          Got 'em!

          EXT. CANYONLANDS

          Terry unlocks Hale's handcuffs.

          TERRY
          I've got a radio in the truck. We
          can call McMurran and get the
          Marines in here.

          

          

          

          

           25.

          HALE
          (shakes head)
          Deakins'll be monitoring any radio
          transmissions out of here.
          (off her look)
          That's what I'd do.

          TERRY
          Who is this guy?

          HALE
          (a flash of the
          horrible betrayal he

          FEELS)
          Someone I would've trusted with my
          life.

          (BEAT)
          You've gotta get to a phone.

          TERRY
          Me? What are you going to do?
          (no answer, she

          REALIZES)
          Wait. You're gonna go after this
          guy? Isn't he going to have a lot
          guns and shit? I don't want to
          sound insulting or anything, but
          ... you're just a pilot.

          HALE
          I don't have any choice. The
          nukes are my responsibility.
          Besides...
          (pulls something from

          POCKET)
          I do have one thing going for me.

          TERRY
          What's that?
          Hale sticks...

          A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
          Under a rock.

          HALE
          The last thing in the world he
          expects is for me to come after
          him.
          Hale walks off into the light of the rising sun. Terry looks at
          the $20 bill.

          EXT. CREVICE SITE

          The helicopter is parked at the edge of a deep crevice.

          

          

          

          

           26.

          DOWN IN THE CREVICE
          Rhodes comes down the last few feet of rope to the bottom of the
          crevice. Kelly, Thomas and Reed are waiting, shining lights on
          a B-83 lying in the dirt, all in one piece.

          RHODES
          (into mike)
          We've got one intact.
          (to his men)
          Let's go find the other one.
          Rhodes starts off along the bottom of the crevice.

          EXT. TOP OF THE CREVICE - BY THE HELICOPTER

          McKellar is sitting in the pilot's seat, eating a candy bar. He
          turns at the unexpected sound of a truck-driving up.

          A HUMVEE
          climbs up the slope toward the helicopter.

          MCKELLAR
          Grabs his rifle, hops out of the helicopter.

          NOVACEK AND LETT
          Are in the Humvee. Novacek sticks his head out.

          NOVACEK
          Hey, you guys need any help?

          MCKELLAR
          It's an Air Force training
          exercise, sir. I'm going to have
          to ask you to leave.

          NOVACEK
          Hey, no problem. We just --

          LETT
          Whips out a silenced rifle and shoots.

          MCKELLAR
          Barely has time to raise his rifle before he's hit. He drops.

          ANOTHER HUMVEE
          Drives up fast.

          BAKER, JOHNSON AND PRITCHETT
          Get out. Johnson wears radio headgear. Pritchett is furious.

          

          

          

          

           27.

          NOVACEK
          Picks up McKellar's half-eaten candy bar, takes a bite.

          BAKER
          (to Novacek)
          Any sign of Deakins?
          Novacek, mouth full, shakes his head.

          PRITCHETT
          He better be dead.

          DEAKINS (O.S.)
          Sorry to disappoint you, Mr.
          Pritchett.
          They all look over to see...

          DEAKINS
          Walk out of the shadows, smoking a cigarette. While soldierly
          with his men, Deakins is courteous and polite with Pritchett.

          PRITCHETT
          You said nothing would go wrong!

          DEAKINS
          Well, point of fact, nothing has.

          PRITCHETT
          You didn't drop the nukes where
          you were supposed to!

          DEAKINS
          Ah, but we always planned on the
          search and rescue team finding the
          weapons for us, and they have. Mr.
          Pritchett, I really have thought
          of everything.
          Johnson walks up, pointing to his radio headgear.

          JOHNSON
          Newsflash. Two gunships just left
          from McMurran and they're headed
          this way.

          PRITCHETT
          You thought of that?

          DEAKINS
          That'll take care of itself.

          PRITCHETT
          What about the other pilot? We
          saw him eject.

          

          

          

          

           28.

          DEAKINS
          You don't have to worry about
          Major Hale. He's probably hiding
          behind a rock somewhere, praying
          I don't find him.

          JOHNSON
          Someone else might find him.
          (off Deakins' look)
          A Ranger called her base, said she
          saw a pilot come down and was
          gonna go look for him.
          Deakins thinks it over, turns to Novacek.

          DEAKINS
          Get ready. You'll go when the
          clean-up's done.
          Novacek nods, goes to the helicopter.
          Ext. Canyonlands - 4wd trail
          Hale and Terry are hurrying along a 4WD trail toward Terry's
          truck. Terry taken a look at Hale's ripped and torn flightsuit.

          TERRY
          Is that the new uniform?

          HALE
          Yeah. Less constricting.

          TERRY
          The dayshift guy left some work
          clothes in the truck. You can
          have them if you want.
          Hale nods. His feet crunch on something.

          TERRY
          Don't walk there.

          HALE
          Don't walk where?

          TERRY
          On that black stuff. That's
          cryptogamic soil. It's very
          fragile. One footprint takes
          centuries to repair.

          HALE
          That's a new one. Endangered dirt.
          Terry gives Hale a look.

          

          

          

          

           29.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF THE CREVICE

          Rhodes, Reed, Thomas and Kelly move along the shadowy crevice.

          INT. HELICOPTER

          Novacek flips switches in the helicopter, getting ready to start
          up. Deakins reaches in, flips off a switch marked COM LINK.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF CREVICE

          Rhodes hears the connection go dead. He taps his headset.

          RHODES
          Hello? McMurran? Come in.
          Suddenly, there's a soft popping sound and Reed drops.

          RHODES
          Reed? What the --?
          Rhodes looks down, sees blood on Reed. Before he can say
          another word, there's a fusillade of soft popping sounds as
          silenced bullets ricochet off the rock around them. Thomas goes
          down.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Silence from the speakers.

          WILKINS
          Sam? Sam, are you there? Sam?

          EXT. TOP OF CREVICE

          Lett aims a sniper's rifle down into the crevice. He flips a
          switch and a red laser beam stabs out from the scope.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF CREVICE

          Rhodes and Kelly are pressed against the crevice wall.

          THE RED LASER BEAN
          Dances along the wall, heading for them.

          RHODES
          Raises his pistol and shoots at the source of the laser.

          EXT. ATOP THE CREVICE

          Lett pitches back, dead.

          

          

          

          

           30.

          PRITCHETT AND DEAKINS
          Pritchett looks at Deakins -- another part of the plan? Deakins
          is unperturbed. He's holding an overnight bag. He unzips it.

          EXT. BOTTOM OF THE CREVICE

          Rhodes whispers to Kelly.

          RHODES
          We'll open up the access panels,
          put in a couple grenades. The
          nukes won't go nuclear, but they
          will go dirty. I won't lie and
          say we'll be all right. We won't.
          But if we're gonna go, might as
          well take those bastards with us.
          Rhodes scrambles off.

          KELLY
          Just one thing, sir.

          RHODES

          (TURNS)
          What?

          KELLY
          This.
          Kelly opens fire with his rifle. Rhodes is thrown back, dead.
          Kelly yells up top.

          KELLY
          Done!
          Kelly grabs the rope, climbs fast.

          EXT. ATOP THE CREVICE

          Mr. Pritchett looks at Deakins, surprised. Deakins -- putting
          on new clothes -- just grins. Deakins takes...

          THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
          From his flightsuit and puts it into his shirt pocket.

          KELLY
          Climbs into view.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Kelly's voice comes in over the speaker.

          

          

          

          

           31.

          KELLY (V.0.)

          (TERRIFIED)
          Colonel Wilkins? You there?

          WILKINS
          Who is this?

          KELLY (V.0.)
          It's Lieutenant Kelly, sir.

          WILKINS
          What happened, Kelly?

          EXT. ATOP CREVICE

          Kelly talks over the helicopter's radio mike. Deakins is behind
          him, shaving with an electric shaver.

          KELLY
          Colonel Rhodes is dead, sir!
          They're all dead!

          WILKINS (V. 0.)
          What happened?
          Deakins puts the shaver to the radio mike. There's a wash of 40
          static. Deakins pulls the shaver away, nods to Kelly.

          KELLY
          It's the nuke, sir! It's open!
          Wide open! Oh, God, what am I
          going to do?!
          Deakins puts the shaver to the mike again -- more static. He
          reaches into the helicopter and flips off the COM LINK switch,
          then backs away, shaving. He nods to Novacek, who fires up the
          helicopter.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Wilkins slumps in his chair.

          WILKINS
          Call back the teams and get me the
          Room. We're gonna need NEST in
          here.

          EXT. CREVICE SITE

          Novacek lifts off in the helicopter and flies away.
          Deakins turns to Kelly and applauds his performance.

          DEAKINS
          Brought a tear to my eye.

          

          

          

          

           32.

          KELLY
          I'd just like to thank the members
          of the Academy.

          PRITCHETT
          (to Deakins)
          I hope you've got another surprise
          up your sleeve. If I'm not
          mistaken, there are two attack
          helicopters headed this way.

          JOHNSON
          Not any longer.
          They look at him; he taps his radio headgear.

          JOHNSON
          They've just been recalled.

          DEAKINS
          You see, Mr. Pritchett, they think
          they've got an exposed core.
          They'll want to get a satellite to
          take a look, but it'll take ninety
          minutes minimum to shift the
          orbit. Until then? Well, people
          get a little weird when it comes
          to radiation. No one'll have the
          balls to come near here unless
          it's NEST -- the Nuclear Emergency
          Search Teams --and it'll take the
          nearest team at least two hours to
          get out here, and we only need an
          hour to reach our connection with
          the transport squad.

          (GRINS)
          Not that I'm not delighted with
          your presence, but you really
          don't need to be here.

          INT./EXT. TERRY'S TRUCK - 4WD TRAIL

          Hale and Terry are riding in Terry's truck. Terry drives. Hale
          is wearing work clothes. After some silence...

          HALE
          What's your dog's name?

          TERRY
          Bear. I was going to call him
          Death, so I could say things like,
          "I walk with Death," and "Death
          chewed my boots," but I chickened
          out. You?

          HALE
          No dog.

          

          

          

          

           33.

          TERRY
          Do you have a name, or is that
          classified?
          Before Hale can answer...

          THE SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTER
          Rises up in front of them, Novacek piloting. Novacek thumbs a
          button and machine guns on the sides open up.

          TERRY AND HALE
          Terry jumps on the brakes. She and Hale bail out as...

          THE TRUCK
          is riddled with bullets and explodes.

          TERRY AND HALE
          Sprint up the trail.

          HALE
          We've gotta hide!

          TERRY
          Follow me!
          Terry leads Hale up a short slope. Hale scrambles over the top
          and is stunned. Terry runs out onto an open expanse -- no cover.

          HALE
          Hide where?

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Novacek grins, shoots.

          HALE
          Looks at the helicopter as the bullets whistle in. When he
          turns back, Terry's gone.

          HALE
          What the --?

          TERRY (O.S)
          Come on!
          Hale runs in the direction of her voice.

          NOVACEK'S POV
          Aiming at Hale's back. But then Hale suddenly drops from view.

          

          

          

          

           34.

          HALE
          Arms flailing, drops fifteen feet, to deep sand.

          TERRY
          This way.
          Terry runs. Hale follows.

          HALE
          How do you --?

          TERRY
          (looks back, still

          RUNNING)
          I'm a Ranger. I've been over
          these trails a million times.
          Not looking, Terry runs straight into a wall, smacks her head
          and drops like a rock.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Novacek can't see his prey. He gets an idea and reaches back.

          TERRY AND HALE
          Terry is trying to get her eyes to focus.

          TERRY
          Please don't tell anyone I did
          that.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Novacek has a box of grenades beside him. He pulls the pin on
          a grenade and drops it.

          TERRY AND HALE
          Hale is helping Terry to her feet as BOOM -- the first grenade
          goes off. They run.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Chases them, strafing them. BOOM! -- a grenade goes off in
          front of them. They run back. They're cornered. Hale looks
          around, looks up.

          HALE
          Can you climb up?

          TERRY
          Yeah ...?

          HALE
          Give me your gun.

          

          

          

          

           35.

          TOP OF CLIFF
          Terry climbs up into view of...

          NOVACEK
          Who sees her.

          TERRY
          Pull herself up, stands, hands up.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Novacek swivels the helicopter around.

          TERRY
          This has nothing to do with me.

          NOVACEK
          Tell me where he is!

          HALE
          Is down in the fissure, pointing the revolver straight up at the
          helicopter hovering right overhead, figuring out where to shoot.

          HALE
          Blackhawk ... Moved pilot seat
          back a foot ... Puts him right
          about ... here.
          Hale hesitates -- he's never shot at someone before -- then
          takes a breath and starts shooting.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          The bullets fly up from below. One hits Novacek. He slumps,
          pushing the joystick to one side.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Starts to lean over sideways.

          HALE
          Is surprised -- it worked!'

          TERRY
          Watches in horror as...

          THE HELICOPTER'S MAIN ROTOR BLADES
          Angle toward her, slicing the air as the helicopter tips over.

          

          

          

          

           36.

          TERRY
          Dives and rolls over the edge of the cliff as...

          THE ROTOR BLADES
          Hit the rock, sparking, grinding, right over Terry's head. The
          blades stop dead. But the torque of the motor brings...

          THE TAIL OF THE HELICOPTER
          Up and over, in a high arc.

          TERRY
          Looks up.

          THE TAIL --SECTION
          Is swinging over fast and the tail rotor is coming right for her.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Hale runs up, grabs Terry, pulls her to her feet as...

          THE TAIL SECTION
          Swings down, rotor spinning. It digs into the dirt and sand a
          split-second after...

          HALE AND TERRY
          Run clear.

          EXT. ATOP CREVICE

          Deakins and Pritchett watch a fireball from the exploding
          helicopter rise up in the distance.

          PRITCHETT
          We don't have to worry about the
          other pilot?
          Deakins shakes his head.

          PRITCHETT
          Then how come the helicopter
          crashed?

          DEAKINS
          (a flicker of worry)
          Pilot error.
          Deakins turns and walks away, over to...

          

          

          

          

           37.

          BAKER AND KELLY
          Who have taken the three-foot, pointed, front section off each
          nuke. They are loading them into the back of one Humvee.
          Pritchett walks up behind Deakins, still nagging.

          PRITCHETT
          Tell me again how I don't need to
          be here.

          DEAKINS
          Mr. Pritchett, I understand your
          concerns. You and your associates
          gave me a lot of money to mount
          this operation. But they're
          getting ten times that back if we
          succeed.

          PRITCHETT
          If we succeed?

          DEAKINS
          All I can do is my part. We've
          got the weapons, we're ...
          (checks watch)
          ... seventeen minutes ahead of
          schedule and everything will be in
          place within two hours. But I
          can't guarantee that the assholes
          in Washington won't do something
          stupid like not pay.

          PRITCHETT
          What if they don't?

          DEAKINS
          Then the next census for this
          region is going to show a very
          sudden drop in population.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          Giles enters and is brought over to Wilkins.

          GILES
          Colonel Wilkins? I'm Giles
          Prentice.
          (they shake hands)
          My word from your search and
          rescue team?

          WILKINS
          No.

          

          

          

          

           38.

          GILES
          I'm sorry. Picked up any
          radiation?
          Wilkins shakes his head.

          GILES
          That's kind of strange -- if
          there's an exposed core out there.

          WILKINS
          Point?

          GILES
          Probably nothing. I asked for a
          transcript of the last cockpit
          transmission...?
          Wilkins nods to a CORPORAL who hands some papers to Giles. Giles
          reads them quickly.

          WILKINS
          I don't know what you expect to
          find.

          CU TRANSCRIPTS
          We see COLONEL DEAKINS: "This is Deakins! Hale lost it! Oh,
          God! I have to punch out!"

          GILES
          You know these guys? The pilots?

          WILKINS
          Just on the radio. Never met 'em.
          Why?

          GILES
          (looks up)
          What if this wasn't pilot error?

          INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM

          Baird has put Giles on speaker phone. The people in the
          Situation Room exchange looks.

          BAIRD
          No rhetorical questions, Giles.
          Spit it out.

          

          

          

          

           39.

          CROSSCUT WITH GILES IN MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          GILES
          In the last transmission from the
          plane, Colonel Deakins said Major
          Hale lost it and made the plane
          crash. We all assumed that meant
          pilot error. But what if Deakins
          meant Hale made the plane crash.
          Murmurs of "That's insane" "No way" fill the room.

          BAIRD
          Why would he do that?

          GILES
          Two nuclear weapons would be worth
          a hell of a lot of money.

          CHAIRMAN
          To whom? Son, there are easier
          ways for someone to buy nuclear
          weapons. You go to one of the old
          Soviet republics, you can get one
          for the price of a BMW.

          GILES
          I meant they'd be worth a lot of
          money to us. How much would we
          pay to get them back? To make
          sure they weren't used in this
          country?
          A flurry of looks around the room.

          BAIRD
          Hold on, hold on.
          (to Creeley)
          These nukes have codes or
          something that prevent people from
          using them.

          CREELEY
          Of course.

          BAIRD
          No one has these codes -- outside
          of the President and you guys.

          CREELEY
          Access to the codes requires the
          highest security --

          BAIRD
          I mean, not even the pilots have
          these codes, right?

          

          

          

          

           40.
          Creeley starts to stammer. Baird slumps. The chairman turns.

          CHAIRMAN
          (to an assistant)
          Where's that NEST team now?

          ASSISTANT
          They just took off.

          EXT. NEST HELICOPTER - IN FLIGHT

          A sleek, very serious-looking helicopter.

          INT. NEST HELICOPTER

          SIX very serious-looking SOLDIERS are in black radiation suits,
          listening to COLONEL HUNT, 45, over headsets.

          HUNT
          Listen up, sportsfans. Word is,
          this particular broken arrow has
          broken open. Our ETA Utah is
          ninety-six minutes. I want
          everyone to take that time to
          triple-check the seams and seals
          on their E-suits. Let's go!

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          Giles looks at Wilkins.

          GILES
          You think I'm nuts. You don't
          think NEST or the satellite will
          find anything weird.

          WILKINS
          That's right.

          (BEAT)
          But it wouldn't hurt to get some
          gunships fueled just in case.
          Wilkins reaches for a phone. Giles smiles.

          EXT. HELICOPTER EXPLOSION SITE

          The helicopter wreck burns. Hale looks over the terrain.

          HALE
          How do they get out of here?

          TERRY
          Get out? I don't think that
          helicopter's going anywhere.

          

          

          

          

           41.

          HALE
          Deak'd have a back-up. He'd be
          prepared.

          TERRY
          If they've got trucks they could
          take the four-wheel-drive trail we
          were on.

          HALE
          He wouldn't want to go towards
          town.

          TERRY
          He could go to the river.
          Hale looks at Terry -- that's exactly what Deakins would do.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          The two Humvees roll along the narrow, twisting trail.

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
          Kelly drives, Deakins beside him, Johnson and Pritchett in back.

          DEAKINS
          You a fan of boxing, Mr. Pritchett?

          PRITCHETT
          I think it's barbaric.

          DEAKINS
          Me, too! I love it! Two men
          trying to do as much damage to the
          other as he can. As basic as you
          can get, don't you think?

          PRITCHETT
          I think it should be banned.

          DEAKINS
          So do I! God, wouldn't that make
          it more exciting? Having to go
          into dark alleys and basements to
          see a fight? I bet we see eye-to-
          eye on a lot of things, Mr.
          Pritchett.
          Deakins grins; Mr. Pritchett steams.

          EXT. CANYONLANDS

          Hale and Terry stand on an outcropping overlooking the 4WD trail.

          

          

          

          

           42.

          THEIR POV
          The two Humvees make their way along the trail.

          HALE
          See the one in front? It just has
          a driver? They wanted to keep the
          weight down. It has the nukes.
          Hale takes Terry's gun from her.

          TERRY
          You gonna shoot out the tires?

          HALE
          Humvees can reseal and inflate
          with the flick of a switch. That's
          why Deak chose 'em.
          Terry looks at Hale -- then what is he going to do?

          HALE
          I'm gonna steal it.
          (checks gun)
          You get to a phone and call
          McMurran.

          TERRY
          The nearest phone is a two-hour
          walk.

          HALE
          Then you better start walking.

          TERRY
          Look, I know my way around here.
          You're gonna need me.

          HALE
          (very serious)
          I appreciate what you've done so
          far. But now it gets hairy. Go
          to the phone.
          He scrambles off over the rock.

          THE HUMVEES
          Come around a corner. The trail hugs the face of a ten-foot-
          high cliff. Suddenly, from off the cliff...

          HALE AND TERRY
          Jump down onto the roof of the lead Humvee. Hale looks at
          Terry, angry. But before he can say anything...

          

          

          

          

           43.

          IN THE HUMVEE
          Baker swerves, trying to throw them off. He pulls out a pistol,
          shoots up through the ceiling.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Bullets punch up. Hale pulls out the gun. It falls from his
          hand. Terry grabs it as a sharp swerve sends...

          HALE
          Flying. He lands hard behind the Humvee.

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE
          Deakins points at Hale, getting to his feet.

          DEAKINS
          Run him down.

          HALE
          Sprints after the leading Humvee. Deakins' Humvee closes fast.

          TERRY
          Looks back, sees Hale's predicament.

          TERRY
          Here!
          She slides the pistol along the truck roof.

          HALE
          Grabs the gun out of the air as...

          BAKER
          Slams on the brakes.

          TERRY
          Comes flying off the top, landing on the hood, barely holding on.

          HALE
          Is going to be crushed between the Humvees. He jumps up,
          turning, as the bumpers come together. He lands on the tailgate
          facing backwards and fires into Deakins' windshield.

          DEAKINS AND KELLY
          Kelly ducks below the dash and slams on the brakes but Deakins
          doesn't flinch. The bullets bounce off the glass --bulletproof.

          

          

          

          

           44.

          IN THE LEAD HUMVEE
          Baker sticks his gun out the window and aims at Terry and starts
          to pull the trigger when he stops, feeling a gun against the
          back of his head.

          HALE
          Is behind him. Hale gets into the passenger seat.

          HALE
          Gimme the gun and get out.

          BAKER

          (SMIRKING)
          I don't know. I think we got
          ourselves a little stand-off.

          HALE
          No, we don't.
          Hale shoots Baker in the thigh. Baker howls.

          TERRY
          Reaches forward and grabs Baker's gun as...

          HALE
          Kicks Baker out of the Humvee.

          BAKER
          Bad timing for him. He tumbles out, right in front of...

          DEAKINS' HUMVEE
          And is run over.

          HALE
          Holds the steering wheel, yells to Terry.

          HALE
          You drive!

          TERRY
          Climbs into the Humvee, takes the wheel from Hale. She jams
          Baker's gun into her belt.

          HALE
          I'd yell at you for coming after
          me, but you did just save my life.

          

          

          

          

           45.
          There's a look between them, then Hale climbs into the back. He
          finds what he is looking for -- a jerry can of gasoline and an
          emergency tool box.

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE

          DEAKINS
          What're you doing, Hale?

          IN HALE AND TERRY'S HUMVEE
          Hale keeps his back to the other Humves. He pulls gaffer's tape
          off a roll, tears it with his teeth, grabs...

          A FLARE
          Out of the tool kit.

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE

          KELLY
          Maybe he'll set off a nuke. That'd
          show us.

          BETWEEN THE HUMVEES
          Hale tosses the jerry can of gasoline out the back of the Humvee.

          THE JERRY CAN OF GASOLINE
          Flies through the air. There's a burning flare taped to the
          side of the plastic can.

          ECU TIP OF FLARE
          As the plastic of the can bubbles and melts and...

          IN THE SECOND HUMVEE

          DEAKINS
          Stop!
          But it's too late and...

          THE JERRY CAN
          Explodes.

          THE SECOND HUMVEE
          Skids to a stop, showered with burning gasoline. Deakins and
          his men bail out. Kelly, Johnson and Pritchett run for cover.

          DEAKINS
          Coolly grabs a fire extinguisher and starts spraying.

          

          

          

          

           46.

          IN HALE AND TERRYS HUMVEE
          Hale climbs up into the front seat. Terry looks at him,
          genuinely impressed.

          HALE
          We need somewhere to hide.

          TERRY

          (THINKS)
          I know a place.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          Deakins keeps spraying the burning Humvee with foam.

          EXT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Terry and Hale have taken the Humvee to the parking area in
          front of an abandoned mine. The winch on the Humvee strains.
          The cable is attached to the handles on the padlocked metal
          doors. The doors are slowly pulling out, groaning.

          TERRY
          It was a copper mine, barely
          squeaking along for years. They
          shut it-down a few months ago when
          they hit an underground river.
          The hinges on the metal doors buckle and snap and the doors rip
          loose. Hale shuts down the winch, unhooks it from the doors.
          He motions for Terry to drive it in.

          INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE

          Terry drives the Humvee into the mineshaft entrance. Hale uses
          a flashlight to look around. He finds a switch a flips it. A
          gas generator comes to life. Another click and lights come on.
          Now they can see the rest of the entry area, including a wire-
          mesh-enclosed elevator. As Terry looks around, Hale grabs the
          Humvee radio, tries to tune in other frequencies, gives up.

          HALE
          They hardwired in their frequency.
          We can't call out.

          TERRY
          What are we gonna do?
          Hale goes to the back of the Humvee, pulls down the tailgate.

          HALE
          I'm gonna take away Deakins'
          reason for being here.
          Hale grabs a screwdriver from the tool kit and pries open a
          panel on the side of one of the B-83s.

          

          

          

          

           47.

          INSIDE PANEL
          There's an LCD DISPLAY, a NUMERIC KEYPAD and a CLOCK showing the
          current time. The keys are oversized and brightly colored.

          TERRY
          Fisher-Price makes nuclear weapons?

          HALE
          They're designed to be used by
          guys wearing gloves in Alaska.
          He reaches in, hits a key and the LCD display lights up.

          HALE
          These nukes have security codes.
          If you enter the wrong code three
          times, the nuke goes dead -- all
          the circuitry shorts out and shuts
          down. Kind of like the security
          systems with car radios.

          TERRY
          And people say the public doesn't
          benefit from defense spending.

          HALE

          (GRINS)
          Hand me the radio.
          Terry goes for the radio mike. Hale sees something.

          A PLASTIC NAME TAG
          Sticking out from under one of the nukes.

          HALE
          Pulls it out, looks at it.

          ECU NAMETAG
          It's from "St. Judes Hospital, Radiology Department."

          HALE AND TERRY
          Hale turns to Terry as she pulls over the radio mike.

          HALE
          Where's St. Judes Hospital?

          INT. 4WD TRAIL -- DEAKINS' HUMVEE

          The fire is out. The radio crackles.

          HALE (V.0.)
          Deak -- you there?

          

          

          

          

           48.
          Deakins and Kelly look at each other.

          HALE (V.O.)
          Ding, ding, ding, Deak. We're
          starting a new round. You took
          the first couple, but I've got you
          on the ropes now, you son of bitch.
          Deakins gets in the passenger side, grabs the radio mike.

          DEAKINS
          Hey, there. What was that last
          part? There was some static.
          (clicks off mike; to

          JOHNSON)
          Find them.
          (to Pritchett and

          KELLY)
          Let's go!
          Johnson pulls out a radiation detector scanner like the one
          Rhodes used. Kelly and Pritchett get back in the vehicle.

          CROSSCUT BETWEEN HALE AND DEAKINS
          Kelly drives Deakins' Humvee along the trail as they talk.

          HALE
          I know you're stalling while you
          try to find the nukes with your
          scanner, but you're gonna be too
          late. Hear that?
          Hale holds the radio mike up to the keypad as he enters numbers.

          HALE
          I'm entering the wrong code, you
          bastard. A couple more times and
          these are gonna be useless to you.

          DEAKINS
          You really got me there. I sure
          didn't think of that.
          Hale slows down -- something's wrong -- Deakins doesn't cars.

          DEAKINS
          All that time we spent in the
          cockpit together and you think I'm
          stupid? I got some new boards and
          circuits from a friend at Pantex.
          But nice try.
          Hale curses to himself. Terry looks at him. He shakes his head
          they're in trouble.

          

          

          

          

           49.

          DEAKINS
          You know, Hale, I thought of
          asking you to join me on this. You
          wanna know why I didn't?

          HALE
          Because I would've said no?

          DEAKINS
          I would've just killed you if you
          said no. I was more afraid you'd
          say yes. Because I knew I
          couldn't count on you. You can
          pretend you've got guts, but when
          and if it comes down to it, you're
          gonna run off crying like a little
          girl.

          HALE
          You better hope that's true, Doak.
          Because I've got the nukes, and
          there's nothing to stop me from
          entering the right code, if you
          know what I mean.

          DEAKINS
          (flash of worry)
          You wouldn't do that.

          HALE
          Nah. You're right. I wouldn't
          have the guts.
          END SPLIT-SCREEN. Hale drops the mike; looks at the elevator.

          HALE
          How deep is this mine?

          TERRY
          I don't know. A couple thousand
          feet.

          HALE
          That's deep enough.
          Hale opens the elevator gate.

          TERRY
          For what?

          HALE
          A nuclear explosion.
          Terry's jaw drops.

          

          

          

          

           50.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL/ INT. DEAKINS' HUMVEE

          Kelly drives the blackened Humvee as fast as he can. Johnson
          looks at his scanner, grins.

          JOHNSON
          Got it! They're --

          DEAKINS
          In the mine.
          (off their looks)
          I could tell he was inside
          something. There was an echo.

          INT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Hale hurries to the back of the Humvee.

          TERRY
          We can still hide them!

          HALE
          He's got a scanner. He'd find
          them.

          TERRY
          You're talking about setting off
          a nuclear weapon!

          HALE
          They set them off underground in
          Nevada all through the fifties and
          sixties. There's no risk.

          TERRY
          Tell it to the two-headed cows.
          Hale grabs the straps around one of the nukes, pulls. He can
          barely move the thing. He turns to Terry.

          TERRY
          No! I am not helping you set off
          a nuclear weapon.

          HALE
          We won't be down there when it
          goes off. This isn't a suicide
          mission.

          TERRY
          No!

          

          

          

          

           51.

          HALE

          (IMPATIENT)
          All right. Fine. Though I think
          you should know, before I ejected,
          I heard Deakins say the nukes were
          going to be used to wipe out the
          last few remaining handicapped gay
          whales.
          Terry looks at him -- you asshole. Hale looks at her, very
          serious.

          HALE
          I need your help.
          Terry thinks, shakes her head, steps up and grabs the nuke.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          The Humvee takes the turn-off to the mine entrance.

          INT. MINESHAFT ELEVATOR - DESCENDING

          Hale and Terry are going down with the nukes.

          HALE
          When we get to the bottom we'll
          have to get away from this shaft.
          It'll limit the amount of
          radiation released into-the
          atmosphere.

          EXT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Deakins's Humvee comes into the clearing. The Humvee stops and
          Deakins and Kelly jump out, followed by Pritchett and Johnson.

          EXT. MINE - BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT

          The elevator comes down. Hale slides open the gate. He and
          Terry drag the nukes out.

          TERRY
          We'll each drag one down a tunnel?

          HALE
          No. I'm only going to set off one.
          We'll leave the other one here.
          It'll be buried under a billion
          tons of rock.
          They are startled when the elevator starts going up behind them

          HALE
          We better hurry.
          (nods down tunnel)
          Let's try down there.

          

          

          

          

           52.
          They start hauling the nuke down the tunnel.

          INT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Deakins, Pritchett, Kelly and Johnson wait by the elevator.

          PRITCHETT
          I can't wait to see how this fits
          into your plan.
          Deakins' charm peels away for an instant and he fixes Pritchett
          with a stare. Pritchett shrinks back.

          INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM

          Baird, the Chairman and the others are watching large TV
          monitors. Creeley walks them through what they're looking at.

          ON THE MONITORS
          A wide-view, bird's-eye, thermal image of rocky terrain.

          CREELEY
          This is the KH-12 satellite's
          infrared view of the area. An
          exposed nuclear core would be
          relatively hot -- it'd show as a
          circle of bright white. As you
          can see, there's nothing. The
          only heat signatures we found were
          these.
          The image changes. There are four blotches, glowing a dull red.

          BAIRD
          What's --?

          CREELEY
          We think it's Colonel Rhodes and
          his men. Their bodies.
          A look between Baird and the Chairman. The Chairman reaches for
          a phone.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER

          Wilkins is on the phone. Giles looks at him.

          WILKINS
          I understand, sir.

          GILES

          (WHISPERS)
          Was I right?
          Wilkins nods. Giles grins smugly for about half a second, then
          realizes what it really means.

          

          

          

          

           53.

          GILES
          Oh, shit.

          WILKINS
          (into phone)
          I've got ten ships ready to go ...
          We should be hearing from NEST any
          minute now.

          Flying over Canyonlands.

          INT. MINESHAFT ELEVATOR - DESCENDING

          Deakins, Kelly and Johnson are in the elevator. Kelly holds a
          small metal briefcase.

          INT. END OF MINE TUNNEL

          Hale and Terry have stopped at the end of a tunnel. Hale has
          opened the guts of the nuke. He's pulling out a chip.

          TERRY
          How do you know how to do this?

          HALE
          Pilots who fly with nuclear
          weapons have standing orders to ...
          (quoting from the

          MANUAL)
          ... "retrieve if possible, disable
          if necessary and destroy if we
          must," and destroy I must.
          He stands, looks around. He sees...

          EYEBOLTS
          Screwed into the cross beaus on the ceiling.

          HALE
          I'm gonna need your belt and one
          of your socks.

          INT. BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT

          The elevator descends into view. Deakins, Kelly and Johnson get
          out. They see the other nuke lying there.

          KELLY
          Send it up?

          DEAKINS
          (shakes head)
          Let's take care of Hale first.
          Spread out.

          

          

          

          

           54.

          INT. END OF MINE TUNNEL

          In one hand Hale holds Terry's sock, filled with sand. His
          other hand grips the eyebolt. Terry is giving Hale a log up,
          straining under the weight.

          TERRY
          Take your time. Really.
          Hale has pushed the open end of the sock through the eyebolt. He
          tightens a belt around the open end of the sock.

          HALE
          Okay.
          Terry lets Hale down. Hale picks up a big rock and loops the
          free end of the belt around it. Then he picks up a smaller rock.

          CLOSE ON NUCLEAR WEAPON
          One chip has been pulled out of a circuit board. Hale very
          gingerly lays the small rock on top of the chip.

          HALE
          We make a small hole in the sock,
          and when enough sand drains out --
          and we're hopefully in New
          Mexico -- the sock is pulled
          through the eyebolt, the rock
          drops...
          (re: smaller rock)
          ... hitting the rock on this chip,
          closing the firing circuit and
          that's it.
          Hale finishes putting the small rock in position. He stands.

          TERRY
          How much time are we going to have?

          HALE
          I don't know precisely. This
          isn't a Swiss sock. Ten minutes,
          maybe --
          Hale is cut off by...

          BULLETS
          Flying in, ricocheting off the rock walls, fired by...

          JOHNSON
          Thirty yards down the tunnel.

          

          

          

          

           55.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Dive to the ground. They pull pistols, start shooting.

          THE SOCK
          One of Johnson's bullets cuts through it.

          HALE
          Feels sand hitting his face, looks up.

          HIS POV
          Sand is draining out of the sock very fast.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Reaches up to grab the big rock, but Johnson sends a spray of
          bullets in. Terry grabs Hale.

          TERRY
          Come on!

          HALE
          The sock --
          More bullets. Terry pulls Hale. They run down a side passage.
          Hale and Terry fire back at Johnson as they run out of sight.

          JOHNSON
          Shoots after them, then runs up to the weapon. He reaches for
          the rock, stops -- maybe that'll set it off.

          THE SOCK
          The last sand pours out; the sock is sucked through the eye-bolt.

          THE ROCK
          Drops fast toward the nuke.

          A HAND
          Grabs it, stopping it just in time. The hand belongs to...

          DEAKINS
          He looks at Johnson in disgust, exhales, and tosses the rock. He
          pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on, talks into it.

          

          

          

          

           56.

          DEAKINS
          We're at the end of tunnel three.
          (clicks off; to

          JOHNSON)
          You two get this one set. I'll
          take the other one up.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Running along a tunnel.

          TERRY
          What do we do?

          HALE
          Beat 'em back to the elevator.
          Stop 'em from getting out.
          Terry nods. They hurry off around a corner and are met by...

          A FLURRY OF BULLETS
          Fired by...

          DEAKINS
          With his Uzi.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Run back down the side tunnel, bullets winging off the rock all
          around them, shooting back. Hale starts shooting out the
          lights, plunging the tunnel into darkness.

          DEAKINS
          Slows down.

          DEAKINS
          The bit with the sock was good.
          I like it. Still, I'm gonna use
          the the Field Expedient Tactical
          Timer. It's a little more precise.

          (BEAT)
          See, Hale -- you aren't the only
          one who's thought of setting off
          a nuke in this mine.

          BY THE NUKE
          Kelly is there with Johnson. Kelly flips on a lamp on a
          headstrap, giving him better light as he opens up the metal
          briefcase he's been carrying.

          INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE
          An elaborate electronic timer.

          

          

          

          

           57.

          IN THE TUNNELS
          Deakins pulls out a fresh clip.

          DEAKINS
          I need a demonstration. Otherwise,
          some swinging dick in Washington
          is going to say I don't have the
          balls or the ability to set off a
          nuclear weapon. I'm gonna show
          these puppies I'm ready, willing
          and able. Hell, I'm eager.
          Deakins jams in his clip, walks into the dark part of the tunnel.

          HALE AND TERRY
          In the dark, waiting to ambush Deakins and then...

          DEAKINS
          Opens fire -- but not at Hale and Terry -- at the cable along
          the ceiling connecting the lights. The cable snaps and
          electrical sparks shoot out, flooding the tunnel with light,
          showing...

          HALE AND TERRY
          Suddenly exposed to Deakins' fire. The bullets whiz in.

          DEAKINS
          The muzzle flashes from his Uzi give away his position and Hale
          and Terry's bullets scream in at him. He backs around a corner.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Take cover. It's a stand-off.

          DEAKINS
          Well, Hale, I better be going.
          Look at it this way, partner. If
          you wanted to get closer to God,
          you are about to get your wish.
          Hale hears Deakins' footsteps start off.

          HALE
          You're gonna ransom Salt Lake
          City, aren't you?
          The footsteps stop.

          DEAKINS
          What makes you think that?

          

          

          

          

           58.

          HALE
          That's where St. Judes Hospital
          is. You're gonna hide the nukes
          near the radiology department so
          they won't show up an any
          satellite radiation scans.

          DEAKINS
          I'm impressed.

          HALE
          How much are you gonna ask for?

          DEAKINS
          Enough. I've got a broker in
          Stockholm. Monday morning he's
          going to buy me five percent of
          Volvo. For the rest of my days
          I'm going to live off the
          dividends, happy in the knowledge
          I'm helping to build the safest
          car in the world.

          HALE
          So that's it? You're just doing
          'this for the money? I'm kind of
          disappointed.

          DEAKINS
          Why would you do it, Hale?

          HALE
          That's the thing -- I wouldn't.

          DEAKINS
          If you were me.

          HALE
          If I were you...?
          (thinks, starts in)
          Because ... because I got passed
          over for promotion and goddamnit
          I'm going to show the bastards
          that I'm smarter than them all.
          (getting angry)
          Because ... everyone's selling out
          and cashing in, so why not me?

          (ANGRIER)
          Because ... because my ex-wife was
          sleeping around. Because my
          parents abused me. Because I ate
          some sugar.

          (takes a breath,

          GRINS)
          It's all bullshit, Deak. There
          are no reasons. Not really.
          There's no difference between you
          and the guy who shoots up the
          schoolyard with an M-16. You both
          think you have reasons. You both
          think you were wronged. The
          truth? You're both just fucked in
          the head.

          DEAKINS' FACE
          Grim, evil -- fades into darkness as he turns and walks off.

          HALE AND TERRY
          They hear footsteps, receding. Hale bolts out of their hiding
          spot. Terry follows.

          INT. BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT

          Deakins gets to the elevator, drags the other nuke in, shuts the
          gate and starts up.

          INT. END OF TUNNEL

          Kelly finishes keying in numbers into the nuke timer. An amber
          light comes on and...

          THE TIMER
          Starts ticking down from ton minutes.

          KELLY AND JOHNSON
          Grab their guns and run.

          INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE

          The elevator comes up. Deakins drags out the nuke, hits the
          DOWN button, shuts the gate. The elevator descends.

          DEAKINS
          Mr. Pritchett!

          Hale and Terry are waiting for the elevator to come down when...

          Unload with their Uzis.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Back around a corner, side by side, shooting their pistols.

          JOHNSON
          Is shot, drops.

          KELLY
          Grabs Johnson's Uzi and, firing both guns, backs to the
          elevator, kicks open the gate with his foot and gets inside. He
          hits the UP button with the butt of one of the guns and the
          elevator starts to rise.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Step out of the tunnel and fire on the climbing elevator.

          We can go back, try to shut it
          down.

          HALE
          We don't know the code, and Deak'd
          have it wired to blow if we so
          much as look at it funny.

          TERRY

          come.

          TERRY
          Oh, God.
          Hale takes Terry in his arms, holds her.

          TERRY
          I ... I just hope someone
          remembers to feed my dog.
          Hale nods, hugs Terry. Terry starts to say something else, but
          Hale puts a finger to his lips -- he's heard something -- a
          distant rushing.

          HALE
          Come on.
          Hale pulls Terry, running, down the far tunnel.

          TERRY
          What're you --?

          HALE
          You said they shut down the mine
          when they hit an underground river.

          INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE

          Deakins slams the tailgate on the Humvee shut. From the
          distance, he and Pritchett hear the whump-whump-whump of a
          helicopter. Deakins motions Pritchett to stay.

          EXT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Deakins comes out, looks up, sees...

          THE NEST HELICOPTER
          Coming toward him, two miles away.

          INT. MINE TUNNEL

          Hale and Terry run up. The tunnel comes to an end at a big
          hole. The rushing sound comes from the hole. They step up
          to the edge and look down.

          THEIR POV
          Dark water rushes by ten feet below them.

          HALE
          Any idea where it goes?

          TERRY
          No.
          They look at each other. They don't have any choice. They
          flick on their flashlights and jump. They-hit the water and are
          swept from view.

          INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE

          Deakins enters, motions for Pritchett to get into the Humvee.

          DEAKINS
          Get in. We're leaving.

          PRITCHETT
          (re: Kelly and

          JOHNSON)
          Aren't you going to wait for them?

          DEAKINS
          No time. And if they get out,
          they might talk. Fortunately,
          there's something wrong with the
          elevator.
          Deakins opens fire with his Uzi on the generator. Sparks fly
          and the thing shuts down.

          INT. ELEVATOR

          Kelly is jarred when the elevator stops and the lights dim.

          EXT. MINE ENTRANCE

          Deakins and Pritchett drive out of the mine in the Humvee.
          Deakins punches the trip odometer, setting it to zeroes.

          Jutting down like knives, ready-to rip then open.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Dodge them, push off, duck under. And then they notice that...

          THE CEILING
          Is getting lower, getting closer to the surface of the water.
          They're running out of breathing room. Three feet, two feet,
          one foot. They take big breaths, maybe their last, and
          they're...

          UNDERWATER
          Tumbling along, pulled at by the eddies, flashlights showing
          their faces -- they are running out of air. And then, there's
          light above them in the water.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Lungs bursting, they start kicking up.

          Closing in on him.

          PRITCHETT

          PRITCHETT
          I think I've finally figured out

          but we're going to rise from the
          dead and

          DEAKINS
          Very suddenly and very violently lashes out. The side of his
          hand hits Pritchett in the throat.

          PRITCHETT
          Gags silently, suddenly unable to get any air. He pulls at his
          throat, even pounds himself in the back of the neck. No go. He
          slowly slumps, dying, skin turning blue.

          THE NEST HELICOPTER
          Drops out of sight behind a rock formation. There's an
          explosion and a ball of fire shoots up.

          EXT. COLORADO RIVER - RIVER BANK

          Terry looks over at Hale -- holy shit.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          The lamps are still swinging.

          GILES
          That's all we need. A goddamn
          earthquake.

          WILKINS
          Son, I was at the Nevada Test site
          in the fifties. That wasn't an
          earthquake.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          Deakins picks himself up.

          DEAKINS
          (to himself)
          At least I know they work.

          INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM

          Wilkins grabs a phone. Giles is pacing, freaked.

          

          

          

          

           68.

          WILKINS
          (into phone)
          Get me the Room.

          GILES
          I have to get out of here.

          WILKINS
          You're going to be fine. It was
          underground.
          (into phone)
          Colonel Wilkins for General
          Creeley.

          GILES
          How do you know?

          WILKINS
          For one thing, if it was above
          ground, it wouldn't have caused
          the same kind of ground tremor.
          For another, if it was above
          ground, we'd all be blind and
          dying.
          (into phone)
          Sir, we've just had a detonation.

          INT. PENTAGON -- SITUATION ROOM

          Bedlam. People yelling. The Chairman is huddling with Baird.

          BAIRD
          How'd that happen?

          CHAIRMAN
          I don't know, but thank God it
          happened underground.

          BAIRD
          What do we do now?

          CHAIRMAN
          First thing we do is put a huge
          goddamn lid on this thing. With
          all due respect to your boy Giles
          and his belief in honesty as the
          best policy, from now on and until
          the end of time, what happened in
          Utah tonight was an earthquake.
          All right?
          Baird nods.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          The Humvee races along the trail.

          

          

          

          

           69.

          IN THE HUMVEE
          Deakins and the dead Pritchett motor along. Deakins turns to
          Pritchett as if Pritchett had just asked him a question.

          DEAKINS
          The helicopter? It was hit by
          EMP. Electromagnetic pulse. It's
          released in a nuclear detonation.
          It wipes out anything electronic
          for miles. That"s another reason
          I wanted to set off a nuke. I
          knew it'd bring down any
          helicopters coming for us. It'll
          also shut down all radio
          communications for a few hours,
          which will severely screw up their
          response.

          (GRINS)
          You see, Mr. Pritchett? There
          really is nothing for you to worry
          about.
          Pritchett's body seems to nod from the motion of the Humvee.

          EXT. COLORADO RIVER - RIVER BANK


          BUTTERFLIES
          Hover and dance over the water in the early morning light.

          HALE
          Hale has his shirt off and is wringing it out.

          TERRY (O.S.)
          Goddamn it!
          He turns to see Terry trying to undo her buttons but unable to
          her fingers are too numb.

          TERRY
          Stupid buttons. I hate these
          shirts. They're ugly and stupid
          and --
          Terry suddenly starts crying. It's not the shirt she's upset
          about. Hale holds her.

          HALE
          It's okay.

          TERRY
          We just ... I mean, we almost...

          HALE
          I know.

          

          

          

          

           70.

          TERRY
          A nuclear bomb went off.

          HALE
          That it did.

          TERRY
          Are we...?

          HALE
          Look.
          (points at

          BUTTERFLIES)
          If the butterflies are okay, then
          we'll be okay.

          TERRY
          Really?

          HALE
          Absolutely. It says so in the
          manual. "If you see butterflies
          after a detonation, you are fine."
          Terry looks at Hale. She knows he's bullshitting her, but she
          appreciates it. They look at each other. They could kiss ...
          but they both shy away from it. Terry gets her shirt off.

          HALE
          We better get moving. We might be
          able to reach Deakins when he gets
          to the river.
          They start off along a trail by the river.

          HALE
          Something I've been meaning to ask.
          (Terry looks at him)
          How did someone like you end up
          with a gun?

          TERRY
          I hit a bankrobber with a frozen
          chicken.

          HALE
          Excuse me?

          TERRY
          I came out here one summer during
          college. It was the campaign to
          stop the dam in the Grand Canyon.
          I loved it here. I came back,
          worked as a river guide and
          eventually stayed year-round. When
          a Park Ranger job came open, I
          applied.

          

          

          

          

           71.

          HALE
          I'm still waiting for the chicken.

          TERRY
          The local Parks Department wasn't
          sure how I'd do with the law
          enforcement part of the job. Well,
          one night I was coming home from
          the store and Tommy Drewson part
          of the local brain trust was
          robbing old Bob Kearney in front
          of the ATM. I bear old Bob
          yelling and I see Tommy heading
          for his car, so I tossed a bag of
          groceries at him at thirty miles
          an hour. A frozen chicken in the
          bag hit him in the forehead and he
          dropped like a rock. Next thing
          I know, I'm a Ranger.
          Hale looks at Terry with a new appreciation.

          EXT. 4WD TRAIL

          Deakins pilots the Humvee along the trail.

          EXT. COLORADO RIVER - RIVERBANK TRAIL

          Hale and Terry are crouching behind a rock, looking down.

          THEIR POV
          A zodiac raft has been pulled up on the river bank. A man with
          an Uzi -- SHEPPARD -- waits, duffel bag by his feet.

          TERRY
          Get me a frozen Zacky's fryer and
          he's a dead man.
          There's the sound of an approaching engine. Sheppard stands,
          gun ready. The engine stops. A few seconds later...

          DEAKINS
          Appears, walking down a footpath toward Sheppard.

          SHEPPARD
          Where is everyone?

          DEAKINS
          I am everyone. Let's go.
          Sheppard hurries to Deakins. They disappear up the footpath.

          

          

          

          

           72.

          HALE AND TERRY

          HALE
          Shit.

          TERRY
          What?

          HALE
          We're the only ones who know
          what's going on, and I don't have
          the faintest idea how we're gonna
          stop them.

          TERRY
          You'll think of something.

          HALE
          Why do you say that?

          TERRY
          You have so far.
          Hale looks at Terry -- she's right. But it almost pisses him
          off more than it gives him confidence. He grumbles to himself
          and starts off down toward the raft.

          TERRY
          Sink it?

          HALE
          Steal it.
          They get down to the raft. They climb in. Hale grabs the
          engine throttle, slumps.

          HALE
          Keys.
          Hale looks around, spots Sheppard's duffel bag lying on the
          riverbank. He hops out and starts rummaging through it when
          they hear grunting and feet approaching.
          Hale looks around for a place to hide. There isn't any. Terry
          tries to get out of the raft, but she trips on a tarpaulin
          bunched on the bottom of the raft. she drops.

          WITH DEAKINS AND SHEPPARD
          Coming down a path, lugging the last remaining nuke.

          THEIR POV
          Of the raft. Hale and Terry are nowhere to be seen.

          

          

          

          

           73.

          HALE
          Is alone, in the water, on the far side of the raft, very
          silent. He hears Deakins and Sheppard load the nuke into the
          raft.

          SHEPPARD (O.S.)
          Why were you driving around with
          a dead guy?

          DEAKINS (O.S.)
          Because I like him. He doesn't
          ask a lot of annoying questions.
          All right?
          A few seconds later the engine starts up. Hale ducks down under
          water as the raft takes off over him. He surfaces to watch the
          raft zooming off into the distance. He is very worried.

          ON THE RAFT - MOVING
          The nuke is on a pallet in the middle of the raft. Sheppard
          pilots the raft. Deakins looks around, sees what he wants.

          A TARP
          Is lying on the deck of the raft along one side, all bunched up.
          It'd be the kind of thing you'd hide under.

          DEAKINS
          Grabs the tarp and pulls.

          UNDER THE TARP
          There's no one there.

          DEAKINS
          Throws the tarp over the nuke. As he does, we PAN OVER to...

          A LONG CRATE MARKED "LIFE JACKETS"
          Strapped to one of the side pontoons. A small triangle of cloth
          is sticking out from inside the crate -- like the corner of a
          shirt. It's quickly pulled out of sight from within.

          BACK ON THE RIVERBANK
          Hale climbs out of the water and looks around, not knowing quite
          what to do.

          EXT. LAKE POWELL - TRANSFER POINT

          The zodiac boat is on the shore. Sheppard and four man -- call
          them the GUNMEN -- are hauling the nuke to the truck. Deakins
          walks with another man -- MAX, 50s. Max checks his watch.

          

          

          

          

           74.

          MAX
          Your friends in Washington should
          be getting the package about now.

          DEAKINS
          I wish I could see their faces.

          INT. PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM

          Baird, the Chairman, Creeley and the others are all staring
          slack-jawed at a TV screen.

          ON THE TV
          Camcorder shot of Deakins against a black backdrop.

          DEAKINS
          ... two-hundred-and-fifty million
          dollars, by nine a.m. Utah time.
          The depositing instructions are in
          the envelope that came with this
          tape. This deadline is not
          negotiable, and there is no grace
          period. The device is on a timer.
          Shortly after you receive this,
          the timer will be activated. At
          nine a.m., I will make a call. If
          I find out you've done as you've
          been told, I will stop the timer.
          If you have not complied --
          The screen suddenly cuts to a flurry of images of nuclear
          destruction -- buildings being knocked sideways, mushroom
          clouds, shockwaves, fires.

          CHAIRMAN
          Turn that off!

          EXT. LAKE POWELL

          Hale runs along the shoreline, headed for...

          A MARINA
          Where houseboats are rented out. Hale's eyes focus on a sign
          with a picture of a phone on it.

          EXT. LAKE POWELL - TRANSFER POINT

          The back gate of the truck is shut from the inside. The truck
          starts up and rumbles off, slowly at first.

          TERRY
          Jumps up from the raft and runs after the truck, staying right
          behind. She grabs a handhold and pulls herself up. She holds
          on tight as the truck bounces off down the dirt road.

          

          

          

          

           75.

          INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM

          Loud voices and crosstalk. Baird is on the phone, nodding.

          BAIRD
          Yes, sir.
          Creeley's phone rings. He answers it.

          CREELEY
          Creeley.

          BAIRD
          (covers phone; to

          CHAIRMAN)
          The President wants to know if we
          know where the device is headed.

          CHAIRMAN
          If Deakins had a plane waiting, it
          could be anywhere. We just don't
          know.

          CREELEY
          I do.
          (all eyes on him)
          Major Hale is alive. According to
          him, Colonel Deakins is headed for
          Salt Lake City.

          EXT. LAKE POWELL - MARINA

          Army helicopters are landing near the marina. Two are already
          down. One has TROOPS standing outside of it.

          HALE, WILKINS AND GILES
          Are walking toward the second helicopter.

          WILKINS
          We found the raft on the other
          side of the lake. Tracks from a
          heavy truck ran out when they hit
          the paved road.

          HALE
          If we get a rad scanner we can
          track them.
          A brief look between Wilkins and Giles.

          WILKINS
          Actually, Major, we're going back
          to McMurran.

          HALE
          What?

          

          

          

          

           76.

          GILES
          We'd just like to ask you a few
          questions.

          HALE
          I'm not wasting time answering
          questions. We've got --

          WILKINS
          No debate, Major. I was given
          orders. Now, you can come with us,
          or you can go with them.
          Wilkins nods over at the other helicopter. The troops standing
          in front of it are MPs. Hale looks at Wilkins, astounded.

          EXT./INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER - IN FLIGHT

          Wilkins is up front with the pilot. Hale and Giles are in back.
          All wear headsets. Hale is yelling at Wilkins.

          HALE
          Deakins thinks I'm dead. He
          thinks it's over. You've got to
          let me go after him. I can help.
          I know how his mind works.

          WILKINS
          Major, I know this is personal for
          you, but I think we can handle it.
          We're putting a wall of men and
          machines around Salt Lake City as
          we speak. That truck is not
          getting through.

          INT. TRUCK


          CLOSE ON THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
          Dusty slices of light come through the truck's slatted walls.
          The nuclear weapon is lashed to a hammock, straps running off to
          D-rings on the sides. Max is hooking up an electronic timer.

          INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER


          HALE
          What about the Ranger?

          GILES
          What about her?

          HALE
          When you find that truck, you'll
          hit it hard. Chances are she'll
          be killed in the crossfire.
          "Regrettable but unavoidable."

          

          

          

          

           77.
          Giles and Wilkins share a look -- Hale is right.

          HALE
          Look, she's not supposed to be
          there. She should be checking
          camping permits, finding lost
          kids. She...

          (BEAT)
          She saved my life.
          Giles wants to help. So does Wilkins, but...

          WILKINS
          We were ordered to take you back
          to McMurran. You understand what
          orders are, don't you, Major?
          Wilkins turns away. Hale sits back, mind racing, not knowing
          what to do. He quickly grabs a pistol from the helicopter's
          weapons rack and puts it to Wilkin's neck.

          WILKINS
          Major, put that away or say
          goodbye to your career and hello
          to twenty years in Leavenworth.

          HALE
          If that's what it takes.

          WILKINS
          You'll have to shoot me.
          Hale thinks, but there's no way he can do that. He lowers the
          gun, sits back.
          Giles gets Hale's attention, then points to his own head. Hale
          doesn't understand, so Giles grabs Hale's gunhand and puts the
          gun up to his head.

          GILES
          Colonel! How about this?
          Wilkins looks back, sees Hale holding the gun to Giles' head.

          HALE
          (bad acting)
          I swear to God I'll shoot.
          Wilkins grins.

          INT. TRUCK

          Max finishes hooking up the timer. He looks at Deakins.

          MAX
          Ready when you are.

          

          

          

          

           78.

          DEAKINS
          Wait until I get back. I'm going
          to check on Sheppard.
          Deakins goes to a ladder that leads up to the ceiling.

          INT. WILKIN'S HELICOPTER

          Hale is looking back and forth between what he sees out the
          window and the map on his lap.

          WILKINS
          I don't know what you're looking
          for, Major. Every road between
          here and salt Lake has already
          been sealed.

          HALE
          Deak would know that. Maybe he's
          not on the road.
          Wilkins doesn't understand.

          HALE
          They were using maps like these to
          set up the roadblocks?

          WILKINS
          Yes...?

          HALE
          Then that's the answer.
          Wilkins doesn't understand. Hale points outside, down at...

          TRAIN TRACKS
          On the ground. Old ones, half-covered by weeds.

          HALE
          It's an old spur. Probably hasn't
          been used in twenty years. Nobody
          bothered to put it on the new maps.

          WILKINS
          What are you --?

          HALE
          The nuke isn't in a truck,
          Colonel. It's on a train.

          EXT. TRAIN

          A freight train -- engine, a car carrier (carrying a load of
          Toyotas), several boxcars and a caboose. A hatch opens up an
          the roof of one of the boxcars near the tail of the train and...

          

          

          

          

           79.

          DEAKINS
          Climbs out and we discover that indeed they are not in a truck,
          they're in a train. The "nuke boxcar" has a small satellite
          dish mounted on the roof.

          THE FOUR GUNMEN
          Are in position at points along the train, ready with Uzis.

          INT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER

          Wilkins hangs up the radio mike.

          WILKINS
          Radio's still down. We'll head
          north, look for a phone, then look
          for a train.
          Giles nods. Hale is thinking. Wilkins starts to tell the pilot.

          HALE
          No. Go south.

          GILES
          Salt Lake is north.

          HALE
          He's not going to Salt Lake.

          GILES
          But you said it would be Salt
          Lake. You found that hospital tag.

          HALE
          He planted that. He wanted
          whoever found it to think that's
          where he was going.
          (Shakes head)
          He's been doing a rope-a-dope.
          Giles and Wilkins look at him like he's nuts.

          HALE
          It's a boxing term. When Ali --
          Look, I know this guy. If
          everything has been saying he's
          heading north, then he's heading
          south.
          They look at him, then Wilkins grabs the map.

          WILKINS
          What's south of here?

          

          

          

          

           80.

          ECU MAP
          Wilkins' finger follows the train line on the map. It goes
          right into Las Vegas.

          HALE
          No. Not Vegas. What the hell is
          there to blow up in Vegas?
          Wilkins' finger keeps moving on the map.

          GILES
          The President.
          Wilkins' finger stops.

          EXT. TRAIN

          Deakins jumps the gap between two boxcars and walks on. We
          ANGLE DOWN to reveal...

          TERRY
          Crouching down between the two cars.

          INT. TRAIN ENGINE - DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT

          Sheppard is working with a torch, welding the brake and
          accelerator controls. Deakins enters. Sheppard turns the torch
          down. Deakins lights a cigarette off it.

          DEAKINS
          How much longer?

          SHEPPARD
          Almost done.

          INT. TRAIN ENGINE ENGINE AREA

          Behind the driver's compartment is the engine itself, with
          walkways along either side.

          TERRY
          Creeps-up to one of the doors that lead into the driver's
          compartment. She hears...

          SHEPPARD (O.S.)
          How long until the helicopter gets
          here?

          INT. DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT


          DEAKINS
          Five minutes. We'll leave from
          the boxcar roof.

          

          

          

          

           81.
          Deakins turns to go.

          INT. TRAIN ENGINE - ENGINE AREA

          Deakins opens the door and strides along beside the engine.

          TERRY
          Is hiding on the other side of the engine, very quiet and still.
          As Deakins goes out the back door of the engine, Terry follows.

          EXT. TRAIN - BETWEEN ENGINE AND BOXCAR

          Terry comes out the door and is about to step across to the
          ladder on the boxcar when we PULL BACK to reveal...

          DEAKINS
          As he puts a gun to the back of Terry's head.

          EXT. GAS STATION AND MINI-MART

          A RANCHER comes out of the mini-mart with a cup of coffee and
          heads for his old pickup truck. He starts to open his door when
          he hears, incongruously, whump-whump-whump. He looks up as...

          WILKINS' HELICOPTER
          Comes in, gets about three feet off the ground and Giles jumps
          out. As Giles runs to a payphone, the helicopter pulls up and
          flies away, leaving the Rancher agog.

          INT. NUKE BOXCAR

          Terry comes down the ladder from the hatch, followed by Deakins
          with a gun.

          DEAKINS
          Terry, Max. Max, Terry.

          MAX
          (to Terry)
          A pleasure.
          (to Deakins)
          What the hell is a "Terry" and why
          is it still live?

          DEAKINS
          She asked me how I thought I was
          going to get away with this and I
          thought I'd tell her.
          (to Terry)
          We're going to a cabin in the
          mountains, not far from here. When
          we get there I'm gonna make two
          phone calls.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

           82.
          DEAKINS (cont'd)
          The first is to the Pentagon. I'm
          gonna tell them where the train
          is.

          (GRINS)
          See, all their forces are up at
          Salt Lake by now. By the time
          they could get a F-15 down here
          the train will be on the outskirts
          of Vegas. And I'll remind them
          about the impact trigger -- if
          they hit this train hard, the
          nuke'll blow.
          (shakes head)
          They won't have any choice.
          They'll have to let the train get
          into the city and because of that,
          they'll have to pay.

          TERRY
          You said two phone calls.

          DEAKINS
          The second will be to my bank in
          Geneva. If the money's in my
          account, I use this...
          (pulls out what looks
          like a modified cell-

          PHONE)
          ... and shut down the timer. If
          not, we sit back, put on some
          shades and get a quick tan.

          TERRY
          But -- radio isn't working.

          DEAKINS
          You saw the dish on the roof?
          Microwave. It's not affected by
          EMP. See? I really have thought
          of everything.

          MAX
          You kept her alive just so you can
          impress her with how smart you are?

          DEAKINS
          (to Max)
          No, I kept her alive because I
          want her to do me a favor. See,
          if something goes wrong and this
          thing goes off, a half a million
          people are going to be vaporized.
          I don't want that on my
          conscience. So I'm not going to
          arm the nuke.

          DEAKINS (cont'd)
          (puts gun to Terry's

          HEAD)
          She is.

          INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM

          The room is silent. Everyone is looking at video monitors
          showing a map of Las Vegas. They are listening to a nervous
          ASSISTANT as he uses a telestrator to diagram the blast effects.

          AIR FORCE ASSISTANT
          Starting at ground zero and moving
          out, we have, in terms of
          immediate effect, one hundred
          percent fatalities to thirty
          miles. Ninety percent from thirty
          to forty miles, dropping roughly
          ten percent for every-ten miles
          after that. The long term --

          CHAIRMAN
          (cut to the chase)
          Son?

          AIR FORCE ASSISTANT
          (looks up, seared)
          Two hundred and fifty thousand in
          the first few seconds. The same
          again within a year.

          BAIRD
          (it sinks in)
          Good God.

          INT. NUKE BOXCAR

          Terry is shaking, tears in her eyes, as she slowly-enters the
          numbers Deakins tells her to in the nuke timer keypad.

          DEAKINS
          Nine ... Then pound ... Good. Now
          six ...

          ECU TERRY'S EYES
          Filled with tears. She blinks and...

          QUICK CUTS
          Terry has visions of RETIREES in Vegas, watering potted plants
          outside their motor home, of TEENAGERS ragging on each other as
          they walk to school, of CHILDREN in a playground.

          DEAKINS
          Seven ... Star ... One...

          

          

          

          

           84.
          And Terry shakingly pushing each button and then...
          The images of the retirees, the teenagers and the children each
          bleach out to white, fast, as if hit by a nuclear blast.

          DEAKINS
          Then ENTER and it's done.

          TERRY
          Her finger hovers over the ENTER button, almost pushes it, then
          shifts to CANCEL and pushes that.

          ECU NUKE TIMER
          The display goes blank.

          DEAKINS
          Stunned. He shakes his head.

          DEAKINS
          Ooh. You really shouldn't have
          done that. I said I would kill
          you, and I will.

          TERRY
          I'm gonna be dead either way. I
          don't want any part of this.
          Deakins shrugs -- he sees her logic. He puts his gun to Terry's
          head. Terry shuts her eyes.

          DEAKINS
          Night-night.
          Deakins is about to pull the trigger when Max stops him. Max
          gestures -- listen. They hear a helicopter approaching. Max
          checks his watch.

          DEAKINS
          They're early.
          Just then, they hear gunfire. Max gives Deakins a look.

          DEAKINS
          It's not a problem. Set the
          timer, then kill her. Have fun
          with it.
          Deakins starts climbing up the ladder to the hatch.

          EXT. TRAIN

          The GUNMAN at the caboose is firing on Wilkins's helicopter,
          hanging a hundred yards off the back of the train.

          

          

          

          

           85.

          INT. NUKE BOXCAR

          Max holds a pistol on Terry with one hand while he quickly sets
          the timer with the other.

          TERRY'S HAND
          Rests on Max's tool tray. Her fingers creep over to a vrench.

          MAX
          Presses ENTER and finishes setting the timer.

          MAX
          There.

          TERRY AND MAX
          Terry swings hard and fast with the wrench, knocking the gun out
          of Max's hand. Max spins, and when Terry swings at him again.
          Max kicks the wrench out of her hand, then steps up fast and
          hits Terry under the chin with the heel of his hand. She drops
          straight back.

          MAX
          Thought I was just friendly old
          Max, huh? Lady, I was a Navy SEAL.
          You should see what I can do with
          just my thumb.
          Max goes for his gun.

          TERRY'S HAND
          Grabs onto something. It's the wrench.

          TERRY AND MAX
          As Max turns back with the gun, Terry heaves the wrench. It
          hits Max square in the forehead. He drops like a rock.

          TERRY
          Yeah? Well, you should see what
          I can do with just a chicken.

          EXT. TRAIN - CABOOSE

          Deakins joins his man on top of the caboose, firing on Wilkins,
          helicopter.

          INT. HELICOPTER

          Wilkins and Hale are returning fire. Hale points at Deakins.

          HALE
          That's him!

          

          

          

          

           86.

          WILKINS
          (to pilot)
          Get him!

          PILOT
          They've got guns!

          WILKINS
          You've got a helicopter. Use it!

          EXT. TRAIN

          Deakins and the gunman keep firing on the helicopter as...

          THE HELICOPTER
          Comes swooping in.

          DEAKINS
          Sees what's going to happen and turns and runs as...

          THE HELICOPTER
          Drops down beside the train. The rotor blades whip about three
          feet over the train roof and the pilot starts forward.

          DEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN
          Run from the blades as fast as they can.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Closes fast.

          DEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN
          Jump from car to car. The gunman passes Deakins. Just when the
          helicopter blades are about to catch up to Deakins...

          DEAKINS
          Jumps down between two boxcars and the rotor blades go right
          over his head. Deakins hears an awful sound and a scream cut
          short.

          HELICOPTER POV
          Swooping fast over the train when suddenly...

          TERRY
          Pops up out of the hatch, her back to the helicopter.

          HALE (O.S.)
          Pull up!

          

          

          

          

           87.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Pulls up fast.

          TERRY
          Watches the helicopter bank away. Bullets-start whizzing by her.

          DEAKINS
          Has climbed up and is shooting at her.

          TERRY
          Runs away from Deakins, shooting Max's pistol behind her blindly.

          TWO GUNMEN
          Appear two cars ahead of Terry and start toward her, shooting.

          TERRY
          Is caught between Deakins and the gunmen with no way out when...

          THE HELICOPTER
          Comes along the length of the train, flying low. It rises up
          and there's...

          HALE
          Hanging from the helicopter on a cable hooked to a harness and
          he's firing a pistol, shooting right over Terry at...

          THE FIRST GUNMAN
          He's hit, falls off the train.

          THE SECOND GUNMAN
          Aims at Terry and starts firing.

          TERRY
          The bullets rip up the boxcar roof around her. She jumps up and
          grabs onto...

          HALE
          As he swings in on the cable, shooting his pistol.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Are lifted up and over...

          

          

          

          

           88.

          THE SECOND GUNMAN
          Who turns, firing a shotgun. Hale's bullets find him. He falls.

          SHEPPARD
          Appears, firing an Uzi at Hale, Terry and the helicopter.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Bullets rip through. Wilkins is hit, knocked back.

          THE CABLE HOLDING HALE AND TERRY
          Is severed by one of Sheppard's bullets.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Drop ten feet to the roof of a boxcar. Hale shoots as they fall.

          SHEPPARD
          Is hit and drops.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Banks away fast, making ugly sounds, smoke billowing out. The
          engine cuts out and the helicopter drops to a hard landing
          beside the tracks.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Watch the helicopter land as the train rolls on. They look at
          each other.

          TERRY
          You stop the nuke. I'll stop the
          train.
          Hale nods. Terry starts forward, then turns.

          TERRY
          I'd yell at you for coming after
          me, but you did just save my life.
          Hale grins. They hear a helicopter in the distance. They look
          over to see...

          A RED CROSS HELICOPTER
          Coming in fast.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Any excitement turns to confusion when they see...

          

          

          

          

           89.

          A MAN
          Standing in the doorway of the Red Cross helicopter, holding a
          gun.

          TERRY
          That's Deakins' escape route.

          HALE
          Not any more.
          Terry nods. They share a last look, then Terry heads off. Male
          coils up the winch cable, slings it over his shoulder and heads
          for the nuke boxcar and his old friend Deakins. He picks up...

          THE SHOTGUN
          Left by deceased Gunman #2.

          EXT. CAR CARRIER

          Makes her way past the Toyotas.

          EXT. WILKINS' HELICOPTER - BESIDE TRAIN TRACKS

          Wilkins and the pilot stand outside their disabled helicopter.
          The train is way off in the distance. They hear honking and
          turn to see...

          A PICKUP TRUCK
          Tearing toward then along a dirt road, horn honking.

          CLOSE ON PICKUP
          The RANCHER from the mini-mart is driving; Giles beside him.

          INT. TRAIN ENGINE - DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT

          Terry comes into the driver's compartment. She tugs at the
          brake and accelerator levers. It's useless. She looks around,
          spots a cigarette lighter.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Deakins and the one remaining GUNMAN hear the helicopter. They
          start toward the ladder to the roof hatch when they hear
          footsteps on the roof of the car. Deakins gestures to the
          gunman. He raises his gun, trying to figure out where to shoot.
          Then they hear someone tugging at the hatch handle. The gunman
          opens fire on the hatch.

          EXT. ON TOP OF BOXCAR

          Bullets stream up through the hatch cover, but Hale is nowhere
          in sight. One end of Hale's helicopter winch cable is tied to
          the hatch cover.

          

          

          

          

           90.
          We follow the cable fast, over to the side of the boxcar to
          find...

          HALE
          Standing, tugging on the cable, still attached to the harness.
          Hale racks a load in the shotgun and jumps back off the side of
          the train.

          INT. BOXCAR

          The gunman hears a sound, starts to turn, just as...

          HALE
          Swings into the boxcar on the cable, firing the shotgun.

          THE GUNMAN
          Is picked up by the blast and smashed back through the wood slat
          wall of the boxcar and out of the train.

          DEAKINS
          Climbs up fast through the hatch to the roof.

          HALE
          Shoots at Deakins, misses. The shotgun clicks empty. Hale
          tosses the gun then unhooks the cable from the harness. He
          drops to the floor-of the boxcar and runs to the ladder.

          EXT. CAR CARRIER

          Terry has a three-foot length of gasoline-soaked cloth stuffed
          into the gas tank opening of a Toyota on the lower level of the
          car carrier. She lights it and hurries off.

          EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN

          Deakins steadies himself as...

          THE RED CROSS HELICOPTER
          Hovers in sideways toward the train. The MAN in the doorway
          holds out a hand to Deakins.

          DEAKINS
          Is reaching for the man's hand and grabs it when...

          HALE
          Reaches out of the hatch and grabs onto Deakins' foot.

          

          

          

          

           91.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Deakins kicks free of Hale, holds onto the man in the helicopter
          and is pulled onboard.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Moves sideways over the train.

          IN THE HELICOPTER
          Deakins turns, pulling his gun and shoots down at the train as...

          THE HELICOPTER
          Moves back sideways over the train.

          DEAKINS' POV
          No sign of Hale on the train roof.

          DEAKINS
          Get us out of here!

          THE PILOT
          Nods and starts to lift and bank. Then he gets an odd
          expression. The helicopter isn't doing what he wants.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Is hovering over the train, but it can't fly away because...

          HALE
          Is hanging onto the skids and he's hooked the cable to the skid.
          The other end of the cable is still attached to the hatch.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Strains against the cable, but it doesn't snap.

          IN THE HELICOPTER

          DEAKINS
          Hurry!

          POWER LINES
          Cross the track, a quarter-mile ahead.

          DEAKINS
          Leans out of the helicopter with his Uzi, shooting down at...

          

          

          

          

           92.

          HALE
          Who grabs onto the cable and slides down it to the roof of the
          train, bullets plugging in all around his. He jumps down
          through the hatch as...

          DEAKINS
          Sees what's coming and jumps.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Hits...

          THE POWER LIKES
          Which snap, shoot sparks and wrap around the helicopter's rotor.

          THE HELICOPTER
          Breaks up and flies apart as the train rolls on.

          EXT. CAR CARRIER

          The flame burning up the gas-soaked cloth goes into the Toyota
          gas tank and...

          THE TOYOTA
          Explodes.

          INT. NUKE BOXCAR

          Hale gets to his feet, goes to look at the nuke.

          ECU NUKE TIMER
          Five minutes and counting.

          HALE
          Looks at it, trying to figure out how to disarm it. He hears
          the whoosh-thump of someone jumping down into the boxcar. He
          turns.

          DEAKINS
          Stands there, trying to smile, trying to be cool, but...

          DEAKINS
          They would've paid and I would've
          stopped it. You've made a very,
          very big mistake.

          HALE
          It's over, Deak. I beat you.
          Disarm it.

          

          

          

          

           93.

          DEAKINS
          If it's over and you beat me, you
          disarm it.

          HALE
          Deak...

          DEAKINS
          Course you are going to need this.
          (holds cell-phone

          REMOTE)
          All you have to do is get it.
          (puts remote in

          POCKET)
          And if you do, as a special added
          bonus, you get this.
          Deakins pulls out...

          THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL
          Then pockets it.

          HALE AND DEAKINS
          Share a look. Deakins puts up his fists.

          DEAKINS
          Ready?
          Hale puts up his fists.

          EXT. CAR CARRIER

          It's a chain reaction, with one flaming Toyota setting off the
          one above it or next to it.

          BETWEEN BOXCAR AND CAR CARRIER
          Terry is looking under the car carrier.

          TERRY'S POV
          The train car axle is smoking, grinding, glowing red in the heat
          from the flaming Toyotas.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Hale and Deakins circle each other.

          DEAKINS
          Modern boxing is a pussy sport.
          They want to make it about scoring
          points. It's not about scoring
          points! It's about this!

          

          

          

          

           94.
          Deakins fakes a right, jabs with his left, catching Hale on the
          chin. Hale is jarred. Blood runs from his mouth.

          DEAKINS
          Okay. You're bleeding. Good. In
          the old fights, there'd be so much
          blood, guys would slip and fall.
          Let's see if we can't get a little
          more of that red goo out of you.
          Ready?
          Again Deakins fakes right, jabs left. Hale half blocks it, but
          is sent back.

          EXT. TRAIN


          CU TRAIN AXLE
          The axle is bending, grinding, groaning.

          TERRY
          Is between the car carrier and a boxcar, looking down at the
          axle, not knowing what the hell she's going to do when she hears
          a horn honking. She turns.

          INT. BOXCAR


          DEAKINS
          Used to be, every fight was to a
          knockout. You know what happens
          when you get knocked out? It's
          your brain slapping against the
          inside of your skull. Here. I'll
          let you see what it's like. Ready?
          Deakins steps toward Hale, about to finish him off. Deakins
          swings. Hale ducks, comes up hard with all he's got, gets
          Deakins under the chin and Deakins sails up and back, landing
          prone, seeing stars.

          HALE
          Stands over Deakins, in silhouette, the light of the hatch above
          him. And then...

          EXT. THE TRAIN AXLE

          Snaps and...

          THE TRAIN
          Jumps the tracks.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Hale is thrown off his feet.

          

          

          

          

           95.

          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
          Swings wildly in the hammock webbing.

          THE STRAPS
          Securing the webbing to the walls of the car start to snap.

          EXT. TRAIN

          The front cars accordion sideways off the tracks, down a short,
          steep, embankment. It's all grinding, twisting, groaning metal.

          FLAMING TOYOTAS
          Fly, tumble, explode.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Hale tries to get to his feet, but then the floor starts
          dropping below him as...

          EXT. THE TRAIN


          THE NUKE BOXCAR
          Goes down the steep slope of the embankment and stops.

          THE TRAIN
          The sounds of the crash cease. Dust and smoke. Burning Toyotas.

          INT. BOXCAR

          Flickering light from a burning Toyota comes in through the
          slatted walls. In this weird light, Hale sees...

          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
          It's above him, at the end (top) of the car. It's hanging in
          mid-air, tangled up in the webbing. Two straps are the only
          things keeping the nuclear weapon from dropping twenty feet to
          the bottom of the car.

          DEAKINS
          Is lying at the bottom (end) of the car, directly under the
          nuke, not moving.

          HALE
          Looks around for something. He sees it --

          DEAKINS' REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE
          On the floor.

          

          

          

          

           96.

          DEAKINS' EYES
          Flicker open. He sees...

          A PISTOL
          Lying a few feet away.

          HALE

          DEAKINS (O.S.)
          You have to push amber, then red.
          You might have time to push amber.
          You won't get to red.
          Hale turns to see...

          DEAKINS
          Pointing a gun at him.

          HALE
          The nuke is armed, Deak. If it
          falls, the impact trigger will set
          it off.

          DEAKINS
          I know.

          HALE
          Half a million people will die.

          DEAKINS
          (thinks, shrugs)
          Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.

          ONE OF THE STRAPS
          Holding the nuke tears through. One strap left.

          HALE
          His finger hovers over the amber button.

          DEAKINS
          Do it and I shoot.
          Hale looks at Deakins.

          HALE
          I guess you really don't know me
          that well after all.
          Hale presses the amber button.

          

          

          

          

           97.

          DEAKINS
          Shoots.

          HALE
          Spins back, blood spraying from his shoulder.

          THE REMOTE
          Falls from his hand.

          DEAKINS
          Is about to shoot again, then hears a tearing and looks up as...

          THE LAST STRAP
          Rips through and...

          THE NUKE
          Drops toward him, point first.

          HALE'S BLOODY HAND
          Grabs the remote and his finger presses the RED button.

          ECU NUKE TIMER
          Mid-air, dropping, the clock and display go blank as...

          DEAKINS
          His eyes fill with true terror as...

          THE NUCLEAR WEAPON
          Punches into Deakins, point first, crushing him.

          HALE
          Gets to his feet and stands over Deakins. He reaches down,
          opens Deakins' pocket and pulls out the twenty-dollar bill.

          HALE
          Ready.
          He heads out of the boxcar.

          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS

          Hale climbs out of the boxcar and starts running through the
          train wreckage and burning cars, looking for Terry.

          

          

          

          

           98.

          A TV NEWSVAN
          Pulls up and a REPORTER and CAMERAMAN jump out.

          HALE
          Keeps running through the wreckage. He stops, unable to breathe
          when he sees...

          A FOOT
          In a boot, sticking out from under a burning Toyota.

          HALE
          Runs to the car, pulls at the foot, tries to push the car off
          the body underneath. O.S. another vehicle drives up.

          HALE
          Come on! Oh, God. Oh, no.
          Hale is pulling hard on the foot when...

          TERRY (O.S.)
          The Air Force pays you so little
          you have to steal shoes off dead
          people?
          Hale turns to see...

          TERRY
          Walkins over from the Rancher's pickup truck.

          WILKINS AND GILES
          Are behind her, grinning.

          HALE AND TERRY
          Run to each other. They embrace, start smoothing each other's
          hair, start wiping blood off each other's faces, start kissing,
          only to be interrupted by...

          THE TV REPORTER AND CAMERMAN

          REPORTER
          What happened here?
          Hale and Wilkins and Giles share a look.

          HALE
          Uh...
          (looks at flaming

          TOYOTAS)
          ... somebody was trying to steal
          some Toyotas.
          

          

           99.
          The reporter asks more questions. Hale and Terry walk off, arms
          around each other. As they go, Hale sticks out his hand to
          Terry.

          HALE
          Rawley Hale.

          TERRY
          Terry Carmichael.
          They shake hands and walk on as we...

          FADE TO BLACK



          THE END
