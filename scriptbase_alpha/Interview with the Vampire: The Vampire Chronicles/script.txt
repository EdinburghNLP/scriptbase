                                              FADE IN:


     INT. ROOM - NIGHT (SAN FRANCISCO)

     A small bare room, illuminated only by the streetlight
     coming through the window.

     A hand presses a cassette into a recorder and fiddles
     with a small microphone.

     Malloy sits over a table fiddling with the tape. He is
     young, half-shaven, dressed in T-shirt and jeans. He
     looks too -

     LOUIS, who stands by the window, looking out on the
     street, with his back to Malloy. Louis is dressed in an
     old-fashioned suit.

                    LOUIS
          So you want me to tell you the
          story of my life...

                    MALLOY
          That's what I do. I interview
          people. I collect lives. F.M.
          radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed
          a genuine hero, a cop who -

                    LOUIS
               (quietly interrupting)
          You'd have to have a lot of tape
          for my story. I've had a very
          unusual life.

                    MALLOY
          So much the better. I've got a
          pocket full of tapes.

                    LOUIS
          You followed me here, didn't you?

                    MALLOY
          Saw you in the street outside. You
          seemed interesting. Is this where
          you live?

                    LOUIS
          It's just a room...

                    MALLOY
          So shall we begin?
               (playfully, almost
               teasing)
          What do you do?

                    LOUIS
          I'm a vampire.

     Malloy laughs.

                    MALLOY
          See? I knew you were interesting.
          You mean this literally, I take it?

                    LOUIS
          Absolutely. I was watching you
          watching me. I was waiting for you
          in that alleyway. And then you
          began to speak.

                    MALLOY
          Well, what a lucky break for me.

                    LOUIS
          Perhaps lucky for both of us.

     Still in shadow he turns from the window and approaches
     the table.

                    LOUIS
          I'll tell you my story. All of it.
          I'd like to do that very much.

     Malloy is uneasy as he studies the shadowy figure,
     fascinated but afraid.

                    MALLOY
          You were going to kill me? Drink my
          blood?

                    LOUIS
          Yes but you needn't worry about
          that now. Things change.

     Louis stands opposite, hand on the chair. Malloy is
     riveted.

                    MALLOY
          You believe this, don't you? That
          you're a vampire? You really
          think...

                    LOUIS
          We can't begin this way. Let me
          turn on the light.

                    MALLOY
          But I thought vampires didn't like
          the light.

                    LOUIS
          We love it. I only wanted to
          prepare you.

     Louis pulls the chord of the overhead naked light bulb.


     LOUIS' FACE

     Appears inhumanly white, eyes glittering. Inhuman or
     not alive. the effect is subtle, beautiful and ghastly.

                    MALLOY
          Good God!

     He struggles to suppress fear and understand.

                    LOUIS
          Don't be frightened. I want this
          opportunity.

     The light appears to go out by itself and suddenly
     Louis is in the chair, dimly lit by the street-light
     from the window. The cassette is turning.

                    MALLOY
          How did you do that?

                    LOUIS
          The same way you do it. A series of
          simple gestures. Only I moved too
          fast for you to see. I'm flesh and
          blood, you see. But not human. I
          haven't been human for two hundred
          years.

     Malloy is speechless, frightened yet enthralled.

                    LOUIS
          What can I do to put you at ease?
          Shall we begin like David
          Copperfield? I am born, I grow up.
          Or shall we begin when I was born
          to darkness, as I call it. That's
          really where we should start, don't
          you think?

                    MALLOY
          You're not lying to me, are you?

                    LOUIS
          Why should I lie? 1791 was the year
          it happened. I was twenty-four -
          younger than you are now.

                    MALLOY
          Yes.

                    LOUIS
          But times were different then. I
          was a man at that age. The master
          of a large plantation just south of
          New Orleans...

                                              DISSOLVE
                                              TO:


     EXT. LOUISIANA - DAY (1791)

     A disheveled Louis, hair in pigtail, in deep pocket
     frock coat, rides his horse through the fields of
     indigo, passing an overseer and slaves at work.

     He passes slave quarters and the distant colonial
     mansion of Pointe du Lac.

     He comes to a small parish church and a graveyard. he
     dismounts and walks through the tombs to an elaborate
     one in Greek Style.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          I had just lost my wife in
          childbirth. She and the infant had
          been buried less than half a year.

     There is a marble angel above the tomb, feminine, with
     a tiny cherub angel in her arms. Louis looks from the
     angel, down to the inscriptions on the tomb:

     "DIANNE DE POINTE DU LAC 1763 - 1791
     INFANT JEAN MARIE - 1791"

     Louis rips away the vines already covering the
     inscription, then drinks from a pocket-flask. His face
     is ashen.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          I was twenty-four and life seemed
          finished. I couldn't bear the pain
          of their loss. I longed for a
          release from it.


     INT. WATERFRONT TAVERN - NIGHT

     Louis in ragged lace and dirty brocade sitting between
     two whores at a gaming table, drinking absinthe. All
     around him flatboatmen, whores, gamblers, black African
     freedmen.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          I wanted to lose everything. My
          wealth, my estate, my sanity. But
          Lady Luck didn't oblige.

     Louis displays a hand of four aces. A gambler at the
     table stands in fury, over turning money, cards,
     drinks.

                    LOUIS
          You're calling me a cheat?

                    GAMBLER
          I'm calling you a piece of shit -

     The Gambler pulls out a pearl-handled pistol and points
     it at Louis. The crowd hushes and draws back. Louis
     smiles drunkenly and stands. he rips open his lace
     shirt, exposing his chest.

                    LOUIS
          Then do me a favor. Get rid of this
          piece of shit...

     The Gambler's finger on the trigger. His hand shakes.

                    LOUIS
          You lack the courage of your
          convictions, sir. Do it.

     LESTAT, a hooded figure in the corner, smiles from
     beneath the shadow of his hood. Gleaming blue eyes.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          Most of all I longed for death. I
          know that now. I invited it, a
          release from the pain of living...

     The Gambler lowers his gun, scowling. Louis pockets the
     fistfulls of coins he has won.


     EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

     Loud, crowded riverfront taverns full of ruffians.
     Louis staggers down, an arm around a whore, drinking
     from a bottle. A pockmarked pimp follows behind.

                    LOUIS
          My invitation was open to anyone.
          Sailors, thieves, whores and
          slaves...


     EXT. WHARF - NIGHT

     Louis, quite insensible, being propped up against a
     wall by the whore in a dank wharf over the water. The
     pimp rifles his pockets, then pulls a knife, about to
     slice his throat, when a shadow falls over him. He
     turns, and we see the face of Lestat, who lifts him
     into the air by his throat, breaking his neck. the
     whore screams and Lestat's other hand clamps over her
     mouth. Lestat drags her towards him. Louis falls to the
     ground, supported no more, insensible. Close on his
     face, as we hear the last breaths of life of the whore,
     off.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          But it was a vampire that accepted.


     IN THE WATER

     The bodies of the thief and whore float by. Above on
     the wharf, Louis, now awake, stares down at them. He
     turns, to see Lestat, towering above him.

                    LESTAT
          They would have killed you -

                    LOUIS
          Then my luck would have changed.

                    LESTAT
          You want death? Is it death you
          want?

                    LOUIS
          Yes...

     Lestat floats down on top of him, then lifts him in the
     air, draws his head back by the hair and sinks his
     teeth in his neck.


     ON LOUIS' FACE

     Every muscle rigid, teeth clenched, as the blood is
     drained from him.


     ON THEIR FEET

     Hovering above the ground, like two quivering dancers.

     THE WIND billows through the ghostly white sails and
     rigging of the boats around the wharf.


     LESTAT

     Floats higher, with Louis in his arms, draining his
     blood. One hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging
     from a shipmast. The other holds Louis. He withdraws
     his teeth, and looks into Louis' drained face.

                    LESTAT
          You still want death? Or have you
          tasted it enough?

     Louis can barely get the words out.

                    LOUIS
          Enough...

     Lestat smiles and lets him go. Louis falls and plummets
     into the water below.


     LOUIS' FACE

     Coming to the surface, in the water lapping by the
     wharf. The bodies of the whore and thief float beside
     him. He looks up and sees Lestat way above him,
     dangling from the rope of the shipmast.


     INT. ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO

     ON MALLOY'S FACE

     Captivated, terrified, enthralled.

                    MALLOY
          That's how it happened?

                    LOUIS
          No. The Gift of Darkness requires
          more than that, as you'll see.


     EXT. WATERFRONT - DAY

     Louis floating by mudflats, surrounded by dead fish,
     the carcasses of animals, eighteenth century rubbish.
     He gets to his feet and walks weakly through the
     mudflats. The sun is coming up over the sea behind him.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          He left me half dead that morning.
          he wanted something from me. He
          came back the following night.


     INT. LAVISH FRENCH-FURNISHED BEDROOM AT POINT DU LAC

     Louis is delirious in a four-poster bed, shrouded with
     mosquito netting. A female slave, YVETTE, bathes his
     face with a rag. She is crying. Other slave women hover
     in the shadows. Yvette puts out all candles save one by
     the bed, and withdraws, with the others.

     Candlelight flickers on the face of the bisque virgin.

     Louis tosses and turns, dreaming, murmuring
     incoherently. Then he opens his eyes.

     LESTAT, exquisitely dressed in French clothing, stands
     by the bed smiling. In the light of the candle we see
     that he is not human; skin too white; eyes too bright.
     Lestat looks amiable, even mischievous, but impossible
     - and angel or monster.

     Louis grabs his pistol from the table and cocks it.

                    LOUIS
          Who the hell are you? What are you
          doing in my house?

                    LESTAT
          And a beautiful house it is too.
          Yours is a good life, isn't it?

     Louis takes aim. Lestat puts his hand over the barrel.
     Louis fires. The bullet tears a hole in Lestat's hand.
     Lestat is unfazed. He takes the gun from Louis' hand
     and throws it away. His hand begins to heal.

                    LESTAT
          You're not afraid of anything, are
          you?

                    LOUIS
          Why should I be?

     Louis reaches for his sword, hanging by the bed, and
     point it. Lestat laughs indulgently. He draws closer.

                    LESTAT
          Are you going to put that through
          me too? Ruin my beautiful clothes?

     He comes closer to Louis, right up to his face, so the
     sword passes through his waistcoat.

                    LESTAT
          Were all last night's promises for
          nothing?

     He reaches out with his now-healed hand and plucks out
     the sword.

                    LOUIS
          What do you want from me?

                    LESTAT
          I've come to answer your prayers.
          You want to die, don't you? Life
          has no meaning anymore, does it?

     Lestat sits down on the bed, drawing up one knee. Louis
     is becoming spellbound.

                    LESTAT
          The wine has no taste. The food
          sickens you. There seems no reason
          for any of it, does there? But what
          if I could give it back to you?
          Pluck out the pain and give you
          another life? And it would be for
          all time? And sickness and death
          could never touch you again?

     The vampire theme rises, with the sound of a heartbeat.

                                              DISSOLVE
                                              TO:


     EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

     The camera drifts through the graveyard where Louis'
     wife is buring. Everything is lit with an eerie glow,
     as if seen through some unearthly eye.

                    LESTAT
          Vampires, that's what we are.
          Creatures of darkness, only we see
          it that darkness more clearly than
          any mortal has ever seen...

     Louis and Lestat drifting, dreamlike, through the
     overhanging vines, comes to the grave of his wife and
     child. Above the crypt, the statue of angel, mother and
     child.

                    LESTAT
          Wouldn't it be sweet to bid pain
          goodbye? To wave away anguish and
          grief? To embrace the peace of the
          unending night?

     The marble fingers of the child on the statue move. The
     angel raises her head and has the face of Louis wife,
     Diane. she raises her hand and touches Louis tear-
     streamed face. The child speaks.

                    MARBLE CHILD
          Papa...

     Louis reaches out to embrace them and finds himself
     touching cold marble. He cries out in anguish-

                    LOUIS
          Diane!!!!

                    LESTAT
          They are gone, Louis. Death took
          them. Death which you can now
          destroy...

                    LOUIS
          NO!!!!!


     INT. LOUIS BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Louis, thrashing on the bed in a delirium. Lestat
     places a hand on his forehead and soothes him.

                    LESTAT
          You have to ask me for this. You
          have to want it, do you hear me?

                    LOUIS
          Give it to me!!!

                    LESTAT
          Vampires. We thrive on blood.

                    LOUIS
          I want it!

     Lestat bends close as if to drink Louis' blood. Louis
     does not shrink back, but stares into his eyes. Lestat
     draws back, then stands up and goes to the French
     doors.

                    LESTAT
          Tomorrow night. You must prove
          yourself. I will give you the
          choice I never had.

     He looks outside.

                    LESTAT
          The sun's coming up. Watch it
          carefully. If you come with me
          tomorrow, you'll never see it
          again.

     He leaves. Louis sits dazed, staring at the empty
     French window. The sun rises with unnatural beauty,
     over the swamplands and the plantation, filling the
     room, striking water-pitcher, glass, mirror, and the
     picture of his dead wife.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          My last sunrise. That morning I was
          not yet a vampire, and I saw my
          last sunrise. I remember it
          completely, yet I don't remember
          any sunrise before it. I watched
          the whole magnificence of the dawn
          for the last time, as if it were
          the first. And the I said goodbye
          to sunlight and went out to become
          what I became.


     EXT. PLANTATION - NIGHT

     Lestat and Louis walk through the slave quarters,
     huddles groups around fires, music, singing. The sound
     of whipping is heard.

                    LESTAT
          Your grief has unhinged you. You've
          let your estate rot.

     In the woods beyond the quarters, the white overseer is
     whipping a black slave, with horrifying savagery.

                    LESTAT
          You let your overseer run riot,
          work your slaves to the bone. We'll
          start with him.

                    LOUIS
          How do you mean, start?

                    LESTAT
          Call him.

     Louis calls.

                    LOUIS
          Carlos!!!

     The overseer turns and comes towards them, with the
     bloodied whip.

                    LESTAT
          Why the bloody whip, Carlos?

     The overseer looks into his eyes, shivers with terror,
     drops the whip and runs for the trees. Lestat is on him
     in an instant. He sinks is teeth in his neck. Louis
     runs to him, tries to pull him off. But Lestat turns to
     Louis and smiles, with his bloodied mouth.

                    LESTAT
          Let's call that a start.

                    LOUIS
          I can't do it.

                    LESTAT
          You've just done it -

                    LOUIS
          Kill me if you will, but I can't do
          this...

     He flees, as Lestat ends to finish off the overseer.


     EXT. POINTE DU LAC - NIGHT

     Louis running up the steps leading to the gallery. He
     is crazed with guilt. He looks up and sees -


     LESTAT

     Sitting collected at the head of the steps.


     LOUIS

     Backs away as Lestat rises and descends the steps so
     fluidly he hardly seems to move.

                    LESTAT
          Don't worry. He was white trash,
          they come at two a penny. I dumped
          him in the swamp and untied the
          slave, licked his wounds clean.

                    LOUIS
          You're the devil, aren't you?
          That's who you are.

                    LESTAT
               (gently)
          I wish I were. But if I were, what
          would I want with you?

                    LOUIS
          I can't go through with it, I tell
          you.

                    LESTAT
          Your perfect. Your bitter and
          you're strong.

                    LOUIS
          But why do you want me?

                    LESTAT
          Because you're as strong as I was
          when I was alive.

     Louis takes out his flask and drinks. Drunkenly, he
     turns and heads for a nearby swamp.


     EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

     Louis stops again in front of the crypt. Drinks from
     the flask, leans his forehead against the stone.

     Lestat appears beside him, radiant, beautiful.

                    LESTAT
          You really want to be with them?

                    LOUIS
          Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you
          promised -

                    LESTAT
          You asked for death. I didn't
          promise it -

     In a quiet rage, Lestat raise his fist and shatters the
     marble face stone, revealing a coffin below. His fist
     shatters that in turn, revealing the half-rotted body
     of a women, holding an infant, no longer recognizable
     as individuals, a tangle of gruesome rotted hair,
     flesh, eaten away lace, insects and worms crawling over
     it.

     Louis gasps.

                    LESTAT
          It's not your wife and child my
          friend. It's death. Just that
          simple. Think and choose. It
          happens to everyone. Except us.

     Lestat stares at him, smiling, becoming a hazy
     dreamlike vision, then hyperclear. Louis again is
     spellbound. He drops the flask, which shatters on the
     stones.

     Lestat appears angelic in his radiance.

                    LESTAT
          We shall be this way always, my
          friend. Young as we are now. I'm
          lonely for a companion, lonely for
          your strength. But I'm not that
          lonely. Do you want to come or not?

     Louis capitulates in one long sigh.

                    LOUIS
          Yes...

     Lestat comes closer, smiling.

                    LESTAT
          Did I hear a yes?

                    LOUIS
          Yes...

     Lestat embraces Louis, obscuring his face. He drinks
     his blood. We hear two heartbeats, out of sync, coming
     together. We see Louis' face, growing paler, paler, as
     his blood is drained. His eyes stare upwards, losing
     their focus.


     LOUIS' POV

     The moon, through hanging vines. The marble statue of
     his wife and child smile at him, as if come alive. Her
     hair blows in the breeze, wonderful gold tresses, the
     child's fingers reach out...


     BACK TO SCENE

     Lestat lets Louis fall down beside the broken crypt.
     Louis looks from the rotting bodies to Lestat above
     him. radiant. Lestat speaks gently.

                    LESTAT
          I've drained you to the point of
          death. If you drink from me you
          live for ever. If I leave you here
          you die.

     Lestat lifts his hand to his lips and blows Louis a
     kiss.

                    LOUIS
          No. Don't leave me here. Give it to
          me.

     Lestat lifts his own right wrist to his teeth. Fangs
     slash his own flesh, blood falls.

                    LESTAT
          You're sure?

                    LOUIS
          Sure...

     Louis rises to accept the first drops with his open
     mouth. Lestat gathers him up, as Louis clamps his hand
     on Lestat's arm and drinks from the wrist.

     The VAMPIRE THEME swells.

     Lestat watches him drink his wrist with wry amusement.
     Louis finishes, staggers away from him as if drunk.


     LOUIS' POV

     Vampire vision. The world is transformed, the swamp,
     the moon, the clouds, the cry of the night birds all
     come to him with unnatural clarity. He looks down with
     pity at the corpses of his wife and child who appear
     beautiful in death now rather than repulsive. He closes
     the lid of the coffin and replaces it in the ground,
     astonished at the ease of it.

     He turns and stares at Lestat whom he sees now with
     vampire's vision. Lestat's eyes are brighter, his
     buttons are glimmering in the light. Everything is
     clearer, brighter, containing more facets of light and
     color.

                    LESTAT
          Stop staring at my buttons. Didn't
          I tell you it was going to be fun?

     Lestat leads him into the swamp. Everything astonished
     Louis, as if he's never seen it before. Louis is
     suddenly racked by shudders of pain.

                    LESTAT
          You're body's dying. Pay no
          attention. It will take twenty
          minutes at most.

                    LOUIS
          Dying?

     Louis dry-retches.

                    LESTAT
          It happens to us all.

     Lestat wipes Louis' brow.

                    LESTAT
          Come, you're going to feed now.

                    LOUIS
          I want a woman.

     Lestat laughs and his laughter echoes like bells in
     Louis' ears.

                    LESTAT
          That doesn't matter anymore, Louis.
          You'll see. Come...


     LOUIS' VAMPIRE POV - SWAMP

     Small high ground. Camp of runaway slaves. Several
     share a bottle of rum around the fire. A male slave
     rises. A gorgeous hunk of flesh in the moonlight and
     goes into the swamp to relieve his bladder.

                    LESTAT
          They're all beautiful now. Men,
          women, the old, the young...simply
          because they are alive. -

     The slave walks towards them in the darkness. A
     crucifix gleams round his neck.

                    LESTAT
          Take him.

                    LOUIS
          The crucifix -

                    LESTAT
          Forget the crucifix. Take him.

     Louis hesitates.

                    LESTAT
          Resist no more Louis. Feed...

     The slave looks up and sees them. Two gleaming white
     beings standing before him with devil's eyes. The he
     runs.

     Louis can resist him no more. He swoops on him with a
     vampire's rapid movement, brings him to the ground and
     sinks his teeth in his neck.

     Close on Louis feeding on the slave, the magnificent
     body shuddering in its death-throes. Lestat stands
     above, laughing.

     The slave dies. Louis rises from him, drunkenly,
     engorged with blood.

                    LOUIS
          What have I done?

                    LESTAT
          You have fed. You were made for
          this...

     Louis looks down at the body of the slave. Lestat's
     laughter echoes around him.

                    LOUIS
          Dear God, what have I done?

                    LESTAT
          You've killed Louis. And enjoyed
          it.

     Lestat laughs harder. Louis runs from him, screaming in
     anguish.


     EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

     Louis reaches his wife's grave. He falls to his knees,
     throws back his head and bares his new fangs to the
     moon.

                    LOUIS
          Dear God, what have I become????


     INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

     Malloy stares at Louis, terrified and enthralled.

                    MALLOY
          You said the slave had a
          crucifix...

                    LOUIS
          Oh, that rumor about crosses?

                    MALLOY
          You can't look at them...

                    LOUIS
          Nonsense, my friend. I can look on
          anything I like. And I am
          particularly fond of looking on
          crucifixes.

                    MALLOY
          The story about stakes through the
          heart?

                    LOUIS
          The same. As you would say today...
          Bull shit.

                    MALLOY
          What about coffins?

                    LOUIS
          Coffins... coffins unfortunately
          are a necessity...


     EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

     Louis walks up the steps to the mansion. He looks now
     like a fully-fledged vampire. Yvette, the slave girl
     stares at him from the open doorway. Cascades of
     harpsichord music come from the interior.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          Killing is no ordinary act. It is
          the experience of another's life
          for certain. That night I had lost
          my own life and taken another's. I
          was drowning in a sea of human
          guilt and regret, with all the
          heightened senses of a vampire...

     Louis enters the mansion, following the harpsichord
     music, as if in a dream. Yvette draws back as he
     approaches.


     INT. MANSION - NIGHT

     Louis wanders into the parlor, where Lestat is playing
     the harpsichord rapidly and exuberantly. Louis goes to
     a full-length mirror and sees his own reflection there
     - quite the perfect vampire.

                    LESTAT
          Yes, that's you, my handsome
          friend. And you'll look that way
          till the stars fall from heaven.

                    LOUIS
          It can't be...

                    LESTAT
          Give it time. You're like a man who
          loses a limb and still imagines he
          feels pain. It will pass. And we
          must sleep now. I can feel the sun
          approaching.


     EXT. POINTE DU LAC

     Dawn spreading over the plantation.


     INT. BASEMENT - POINTE DU LAC

     A brick walled storage room. Two coffins stand on the
     floor. Lestat enters with a lantern, Louis behind.
     Lestat is apprehensive and protective of Louis. He
     pulls back one lid ot reveal a satin interior.

                    LESTAT
          You must get into it. It's the only
          safe place for you when the light
          comes.

                    LOUIS
          And if I don't?

                    LESTAT
          The sun will destroy the blood I've
          given you. Every tissue, every
          vein. The fire in this lantern
          could do that too.

     Louis approaches the coffin, hands trembling as he
     peers into it.

                    LESTAT
          Don't be afraid. In moments you'll
          be sleeping as soundly as you ever
          slept. And when you awake I'll be
          waiting for you, and so will all
          the world.

     Louis crawls into the coffin, fearful yet fascinated.

                    LOUIS
          You told me something earlier. You
          said you didn't have a choice. Was
          that true?

     Lestat smiles bitterly and nods.

                    LESTAT
          Someday I'll tell you. We have a
          lot of time to talk to each other.
          You might say... we have all the
          time we shall ever need.

     He closes the lid.

     Total darkness. Sounds of Louis' panicked breathing. Of
     his prayer again.

                    LOUIS
          Dear God, what have I done?


     INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     Louis and Lestat sitting at a sumptuous table, piled
     with uneaten food. Lestat is going through sheafs of
     documents.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          I awoke the next evening to a
          different world. And I realized
          there are as profound differences
          between vampires as between human
          beings...

     Lestat, totting up figures on a piece of paper.

                    LESTAT
          Your wealth, dear Louis, is
          inestimable. Your income from
          cotton alone will keep us in
          comfort for a century.

     Louis just stares at him.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          I sat there staring at him with
          contempt. He had the soul of a
          shopkeeper, he was the sow's ear
          out of which nothing fine could be
          made. I felt sadly cheated in
          having him as a teacher...

     Lestat looks up at him and grins.

                    LESTAT
          You'll get used to killing. Just
          forget about that mortal coil.
          You'll become accustomed to things
          all too quickly.

                    LOUIS
          Do you think so?

     Yvette enters, stands behind him, staring at Lestat
     with loathing.

                    YVETTE
          You are not hungry, sir...

                    LESTAT
          Au contraire, my dear. He could eat
          a horse...

     Lestat laughs loudly. Louis turns and looks at Yvette.
     Her beautiful forehead in the candlelight, the veins
     pulsing on her neck and her hands.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          I looked at anything mortal and saw
          all life as precious, condemning
          all fruitless guilt and passion
          that would let it slip through the
          fingers like sand...

     Yvette returns his stare, troubled.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          It was only as a vampire that I
          could see Yvette's beauty. Her fear
          of me increased my desire.

     Yvette reaches for his uneaten plate. Louis stops her
     hand. Holds it for a beat too long, looking at the
     veins in her wrist.

                    LOUIS
          I will finish it, Yvette. Now leave
          us.

     She turns and runs from the table. Lestat leans towards
     him.

                    LESTAT
          Can't you pretend, you fool? Don't
          give the game away. We're lucky to
          have such a home.

     His hand snakes out under the table. It comes up
     holding a large grey rat.

                    LESTAT
          Pretend to drink, at least.

     He bares his fangs and slices the rat's throat. He
     pours the blood into a crystal glass.

                    LESTAT
          Such fine crystal shouldn't go to
          waste...

     He hands the glass to Louis. Louis drinks the blood and
     stares at it in surprise, then at the dead rat on the
     fine lace tablecloth.

                    LESTAT
          I know. It gets cold so fast.

                    LOUIS
          We can live like this? Off the
          blood of animals?

     Lestat shrugs.

                    LESTAT
          I wouldn't call it living. I'd call
          it surviving. A useful trick if
          you're caught for a month on a ship
          at sea.

     Lestat strokes the belly of the dead rat, studying it
     sadly.

                    LESTAT
          There's nothing in the world now
          that doesn't hold some...

                    LOUIS
          Fascination...

                    LESTAT
          Yes. And I'm bored with this
          prattle -

     He throws the rat away.

                    LOUIS
          But we can live without taking
          human life. It's possible.

                    LESTAT
          Anything is possible. But just try
          it for a week. Come into New
          Orleans and let me show you some
          real sport!

     He rises. Louis follows.


     EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

     A big, lavish drinking place with a raised stage.

     Italian actors in buffoonish costumes act crude
     commedia dell'arte on the stage.

     Plantation owners in soiled brocade, lace, crooked wigs
     watch the show as tavern wenches move about.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          This was New Orleans, a magical and
          magnificent place to live. In which
          a vampire, richly dressed might
          attract no more notice in the
          evening than hundreds of other
          exotic creatures.

     Louis and Lestat by a table, in the shadow of a tree.
     Teresa, a tavern wench, sits on Lestat's lap, pouring
     drinks for the two of them. She lifts a fresh glass to
     Lestat's lips as he flirts with her.

                    TERESA
          Come on, mon cher. The best in the
          colony. Once you touch this you'll
          never go to any other tavern again.

                    LESTAT
          You think so, cherie? But what if
          I'd rather taste your lips?

                    TERESA
          My lips are even sweeter still...

     She kisses him. He lets his tongue play with hers, then
     runs it down her neck. She swoons with pleasure. Then
     he sinks his teeth gently in her neck, looking
     playfully behind at Louis, who if appalled and
     fascinated.


     ANTICS ON THE STAGE

     Laughter rocks the tavern.

     Lestat slips the pale and dead Teresa into a chair
     beside him and folds her hands on the table. No one
     notices. He lays gold coins on the table and touches
     Louis' knee.

                    LESTAT
          Let's get out of here!

     Lestat rushes out, thrilled with himself.


     EXT. TAVERN - NIGHT

     A crowded street. Louis and Lestat emerge from the
     tavern. Louis looks up at the moon.

                    LOUIS
          Have you ever been caught?

                    LESTAT
          Of course not. It's so easy you
          almost feel sorry for them.

     They walk down the crowded night street, full of ladies
     in their finery, freed slaves, whores, sailors etc.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          Lestat killed two, sometimes three
          a night. A fresh young girl, that
          was his favorite for the first of
          the evening.


     INT. FRENCH QUARTER MANSION - BALLROOM

     Small orchestra plays for colonial couples in fine wig
     and garb prancing to a French minuet. Young women sit
     in chairs along the walls with their chaperones. Young
     men stand opposite.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          But the triumphant kill of Lestat
          was a young man. They represented
          the greatest loss to Lestat because
          they stood on the threshold of the
          maximum possibility of life.

     A youth of preternatural beauty, silhouetted against
     French windows. He is talking to an elegant widow,
     seated, holding two manicured poodles. Lestat stares at
     the youth with longing.

                    LESTAT
          The trick is not to think about it.
          See that one? The widow St. Clair?
          she had that gorgeous young fop
          murder her husband. She's perfect
          for you. Go ahead.

                    LOUIS
          But how do you know?

                    LESTAT
          Read her thoughts.

                    LOUIS
          I can't.

                    LESTAT
          The dark gift is different for each
          of us. But one thing is true of
          everyone. We grow stronger as we go
          along.

     He leads Louis closer to them.

                    LESTAT
          Take my word for it. She blamed a
          slave for his murder. And do you
          know what they did to him?

     He smiles at the young man, who smiles in return.

                    LESTAT
          The evildoers are easier. And they
          taste better...


     EXT. LAWNS - NIGHT

     Lestat walks the youth towards a copse of trees. He
     looks back at Louis, who holds both poodles on a
     delicate leash, walking with the widow. The minuet
     spills from the french windows.

                    WIDOW ST. CLAIR
          Now, young man, you really amaze
          me! I'm old enough to be your
          grandmother.

     She leans towards him concquettishly. Louis, crazed
     with hunger, sees her as beautiful in the moonlight. He
     allows her lips reach his. He takes her in his arms,
     gently, romantically, and sinks in his teeth. She
     swoons.

                    WIDOW ST. CLAIR
          Yes, that's the melody, I remember
          it. Oh yes...

     Louis draws his lips away. She is weak in his arms, but
     still alive. He can't do it. The poodles growl. He
     shoots out an arm and grabs one, then the other.


     EXT. TREES - NIGHT

     Lestat, bending over the body of the dead youth. A
     scream pierces the night.

                    WIDOW ST CLAIR
          Murder!!! Murderer!!


     EXT. LAWNS. NIGHT

     The widow on the grass, her poodles dead beside her.
     Louis is trying to quiet her.

                    WIDOW ST CLAIR
          My little papillions! My
          butterflies!!! He killed them!!!

     Lestat comes from nowhere, claps a hand over her mouth
     and breaks her neck. He spits in fury at Louis.

                    LESTAT
          You whining coward of a vampire who
          prowls the night killing rats and
          poodles. You could have finished us
          both!
          
     Louis throws himself on Lestat with extraordinary
     force, pummeling him towards the trees.

                    LOUIS
          What have you done to me? You've
          condemned me to hell.

                    LESTAT
          I don't know any hell -

     Louis hurls him against tree after tree with a strength
     he never knew he had.

                    LOUIS
          You want to see me kill? Watch me
          kill you then -

     He drags him to the ground an throttles him. Lestat
     looks up at him, amazed and amused at the same time.

                    LESTAT
          What strength, my friend, what
          strength. I remember why I chose
          you now.

     Lestat squirms from his grip, seemingly effortlessly.

                    LESTAT
          But you can't kill me, Louis. Nor I
          you.

     He ruffles Louis' hair, with wry affection.

                    LESTAT
          Feed on what you want, mon cherie.
          Rats, chickens, doves, goats. I'll
          leave you to it and watch you come
          round. Just remember, life without
          me would be even more unbearable...

     He smiles. A sly, pleasurable secret secret smile.


     EXT. POINTE DU LAC - NIGHT

     Their carriage draws up to the mansion as the first
     fingers of light spread across the sky.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          Being a vampire to him meant
          revenge. Revenge against life-
          itself. Every time he took a life
          it was revenge. and the slaves with
          a wisdom that was denied their
          masters, began to notice...


     INT. SLAVE-HUT - NIGHT

     In a tiny cabin, a slave family. Kids sleeping on the
     floor, in cribs and cots. The parents sleep on the bed,
     young, beautiful, naked. Beside them is Lestat, who is
     drinking the husband's blood, his hand playing across
     the breast of the wife as he does so. She murmurs in
     her sleep.

                    WIFE
          Yes... please...

     She grabs his fingers and kisses them, thinking him to
     be her husband. Lestat gently disengages himself and
     leaves.


     EXT. SLAVE-HUT - NIGHT

     The woman's scream pierces the sky, as Lestat walks
     into the night.


     EXT. CHICKEN-COOP - NIGHT

     Every chicken is dead, bloodies necks hanging down from
     the cribs. Louis emerges from the entrance, blood on
     his lips. He hears the scream.


     EXT. SLAVE QUARTER - NIGHT

     The sound of drumming is heard, African, primal. The
     woman runs through the quarters, screaming grief.
     Others gather at doorways, restrain and console her.


     EXT. DOVE-COTE - DAY

     A beautiful, elaborate eighteenth century dove-cote.
     Every dove inside is dead, pierced at the neck. A black
     hand throws in a flaming torch and it bursts into
     flame.


     INT. CABIN - NIGHT

     A doll, made in the image of Lestat, is pierced with
     needles.


     EXT. SWAMP BY FIELDS - DAY

     Bodies of slaves floating in the swamp, with the bodies
     of goats. Slaves at the edge throw ropes around the
     bodies, pull them towards the shore. The drumming grows
     louder.


     EXT. SLAVE-QUARTERS - NIGHT

     Louis walking through. The slaves hush as he
     approaches, gather in doorways and whisper. He turns
     and looks at them, sorrowfully. He looks truly like a
     ghost. Their eyes turn away when they meet his. He
     walks on.


     INT. DINING ROOM IN MANSION - NIGHT

     Lestat and Louis sit at the table, the untouched food
     between them.

                    LESTAT
          Consider yourself lucky. In Paris a
          vampire has to be clever for many
          reasons. Here all one needs is a
          pair of fangs.

                    LOUIS
          Paris? You came from Paris?

                    LESTAT
          As did the one who made me.

                    LOUIS
          Tell me about him. You must have
          learnt something from him! It had
          to happen for you as it did for me!

                    LESTAT
          I learnt absolutely nothing. I
          wasn't give a choice, remember?

                    LOUIS
          But you must know something about
          the meaning of it all, you must
          know where we come from, why we...

     Lestat spits out in anger.

                    LESTAT
          Why? Why should I know these
          things? Do you know them?

     The drumming grows outside.

                    LESTAT
               (gripping his temples)
          That noise! It's driving me mad!
          We've been in the country for
          weeks, with nothing but that
          noise!!!

                    LOUIS
          They know about us. They see us
          dine on empty plates and drink from
          empty glasses.

                    LESTAT
          Come the New Orleans then. There's
          an opera on tonight. A real french
          opera! We can dine in splendor!

                    LOUIS
          I respect life, don't you see? For
          each and every human life I have
          respect.

                    LESTAT
          Respect me a little then. I'm the
          only life you know.

     Louis stares. Lestat turns childishly, petulantly.

                    LESTAT
          You'll soon run out of chickens,
          Louis...

     He walks out, humming a French aria. Louis stares at
     his plate.


     EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

     The slaves, gathered on mass around fires. Frenzied
     drumming, dancing. Lestat rides through, scattering the
     flames. The drumming stops. The slaves look towards the
     house. Slowly, they begin to move towards it.


     INT. POINTE DU LAC DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     Louis, sitting in despair by the table. Yvette, the
     slave girl enters.

                    YVETTE
          Michi Louis? You don't want any
          supper?

     Louis laughs harshly.

                    LOUIS
          No, ma cher. I need no supper. Is
          all well at Pointe Du Lac tonight?

     Yvette draws closer. Light reveals her beauty.

                    YVETTE
          We worry about you master. When do
          you ride about the fields? How long
          since you've been to the slave
          quarters? Everywhere there is
          death. Animals, men. Are you our
          master still at all?

     Louis watches her sadly. He's getting hungry. Her
     throat is long and slender, her breasts are gorgeous.

                    LOUIS
               (dazed)
          Leave me alone now, Yvette.

                    YVETTE
          I will not go unless you listen to
          me. Send away this new friend of
          yours. The slaves are frightened of
          him. They are frightened of you.

     She comes closer, and he can hear her beating heart.
     She touches his hair. He takes her hand and brings it
     to his lips.

                    LOUIS
          I am frightened of myself, Yvette.

     He kisses her wrist. She suddenly gasps, sharply,
     withdraws her hand. She sees her wrist is red with
     blood. She sees the blood on his lips. She screams.

     Louis stands.

                    LOUIS
          Hush, Yvette -

     She screams even louder. Louis clamps his hand over her
     mouth. Her hand grips the table-cloth, pulls, bringing
     the empty glasses and crockery to the floor.

     In horror, Louis realizes he has broken her neck. He
     brings her cut wrist to his lips, then drops it,
     revolted. He carries her body outside, grief-stricken.

     The drumming grows louder.


     EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

     Fires burning in the distance, round the slave-cabins.
     The slaves are gathered at the foot of the mansion
     steps. They see Louis come out, holding the body of
     Yvette. He is deranged with grief.

                    LOUIS
          This place is cursed. Damned, do
          you hear me? And your master is the
          devil.

     He places the body of Yvette in a rocking chair on the
     veranda.

                    LOUIS
          Get out while you can. You're free
          men.

     They don't move. They stare at him blankly.

                    LOUIS
          Unlike me, you are no free men...

     He turns behind him, and looks at the mansion, all
     candelabra and chandeliers lighted, all windows open.

                    LOUIS
          Do I have to convince you?

     He rushed up the stairs, snatches up the candelabra and
     sets fire to the drapes. He goes from window to window,
     lighting drapes, lace curtains, everything.


     SLAVES POV - MASTER

     Setting fire to the house.

     They rush up the stairs with shouts of "STOP HIM, HE'S
     MAD". A wall of flame gushes out from the interior,
     blocking their way.


     INT. BURNING MANSION - NIGHT

     Louis, wandering from room to room of the burning
     mansion. he sees paintings of his wife consumed by the
     flames. He is weakening with the fumes, the heat. We
     can see this in his face, the texture of his skin.

     Suddenly a large french window cascades inwards and
     Lestat stands there, whip in hand. Behind him we can
     see the morning sky.

                    LESTAT
          You fool, what have you done?

                    LOUIS
          What you wouldn't do. It's almost
          sunrise. It will be the sun or the
          fire. You said they can kill me.
          The sun or the fire!

     Louis stands there, weakened, then collapses onto the
     floor. Lestat darts forward and catches him before he
     drops. He runs out the shattered window, carrying him
     on his shoulder.


     EXT. LARGE GRAVEYARD - DAWN

     With many crypts. Louis, unconscious, carried over
     Lestat's shoulder.


     INT. CRYPT

     Darkness. Louis lying on the floor of a large crypt. He
     slowly comes to.

                    LOUIS
          Where are we?

                    LESTAT
          Where do you think, my idiot
          friend? We're in a nice filthy
          cemetery. Does this make you happy?
          Is this fitting and proper enough?

     Louis laughs softly.

                    LOUIS
          We belong in hell.

                    LESTAT
          And what if there is no hell, or
          they don't want us there? Ever
          think of that?


     INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

     The vampire sits in silence, as if tired by his story.
     Malloy speaks, hesitantly.

                    MALLOY
          You loved Yvette...

                    LOUIS
          Can a vampire feel love?

                    MALLOY
          You loved your wife, surely.

                    LOUIS
          I was human then. Might as well ask
          can an angel feel love. Both are
          blesses or cursed with a certain...
          detachment. Though whether angels
          take as long to learn it as I, I
          will never know.

     He looks directly at Malloy, shocking him with his
     gaze.

                    LOUIS
          Yes, I loved Yvette. As I loved
          Pointe Du Lac. And as with each
          thing I loved, I destroyed it.


     EXT. NEW ORLEANS - EVENING

     From the sea, at evening, shrouded in mist.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          Lestat I did not love. And he
          survived.


     INT. INN - EVENING

     A lavish little supper chamber with coffered bed, fancy
     French furniture. Open to rooftops of colonial city.
     Louis sits by an open window looking out over the city.
     Behind, we can hear the laughter of Lestat and tow
     female voices. Louis turns and sees -

     Lestat, in the main chamber with two drugged or drunked
     whores. One runs her finger down his chest. The other
     seems out of it.

                    WHORE #1
          You're skin's icy.

                    LESTAT
          Not always...

     He presses his thumb on her neck and holds her tight,
     sinking his teeth into her neck. After a time she falls
     to the bed, dead. he turns to the other.

                    LESTAT
          Your friend has no head for wine.

                    WHORE
          She's stupid. I can warm that cold
          skin of yours better than she can.

                    LESTAT
          Do you think so?

     He rubs her breast.

                    WHORE
          Why you're warm now.

                    LESTAT
          Ah, but the price is pretty high.
          Your sweet friend - I exhausted
          her.

     He bites her in turn, drinks her blood. She does into
     the swoon.

     Louis looks on in disgust. He stands.

                    LOUIS
          I'm leaving you. I can't stand this
          any longer.

     Lestat pulls away from the whore.

                    LESTAT
          What, no flowery speeches? About
          what a monster I am? What a vulgar
          fiend?

                    LOUIS
          I'm not interested in you. You
          disgust me. I'm interested in my
          own nature and know I can't trust
          you to tell me the truth about me.

                    LESTAT
          What do you imagine you are Louis?

                    LOUIS
          I don't pretend to know.

                    LESTAT
          Don't you understand, Louis, that
          you alone of all creatures can see
          death with impunity... you alone
          under the rising moon can strike
          like the hand of God.

     The girl moans.

                    LOUIS
          Lestat, she's alive!!!

                    LESTAT
          Vampires are killers. Predators,
          who's all seeing eyes were meant to
          give them detachment.

     The girl moans again, open her eyes.

                    LOUIS
          The girl, Lestat -

                    LESTAT
          I know. Let her alone.

     He slashes her wrist with his teeth, and lets the blood
     drip into a glass.

                    LESTAT
          You think you can be human. You
          think you can go back. But you
          can't. You live off the blood of
          rats now Louis. How human is that?

     The girls moans again. Lestat drinks that glass.

                    LESTAT
          Lie still, love...

     The girl begins to scream. Lestat picks her up.

                    LESTAT
          You're tired love, you want to
          sleep.

     He walks to his coffin, puts her inside and sits on the
     lid. We hear muffled screaming and banging from inside.

                    LOUIS
          Why do you do this Lestat?

                    LESTAT
          I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take
          you aesthete's taste to purer
          things. Kill them swiftly if you
          will, but do it! For now doubt, you
          are a killer Louis. Ah!

     He stands up. The girl pushes the lid off, hysterical.
     She looks at Louis.

                    GIRL
          It's a coffin, a coffin! Get me
          out!

                    LESTAT
          Of course it's a coffin. You're
          dead, love.

     Louis screams at Lestat

                    LOUIS
          Lestat - finish this -

                    LESTAT
          You finish her - if you feel so
          much -

     The girl grabs Louis and pleads.

                    GIRL
          You won't let me die, will you?
          You'll save me?

                    LESTAT
          But it's too late, love. Look at
          your wrist, you breast.

     He picks her up again. He turns to Louis laughing.

                    LESTAT
          Unless I make her one of us...

                    LOUIS
          NO!!!

                    LESTAT
          THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!

     The girl screams. Louis puts his hands to his ears.
     Then Lestat, in a fit of pique puts his teeth to her
     neck. She dies at last.

     A terrible silence descends. Lestat looks at Louis.

                    LOUIS
          My God... to think you... are all I
          have to learn from...

                    LESTAT
          In the old world, they called it
          the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it
          to you.

     Louis leaves without a word.


     EXT. DANK NEW ORLEANS BACK STREETS - NIGHT

     A rat scurried down a gutter, then another and another.
     Louis' hand grabs the rat. We see him from behind,
     walking down the street, gripping one, then another.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          Am I damned? Am I from the devil?
          Is my very nature that of a devil?
          And all the while, as these dreaded
          questions caused me to neglect my
          thirst, my thirst grew hotter, my
          veins were threads of pain in my
          flesh, my temples throbbed.

     A smaller side street, in which every house is marked
     with an X. The street is crawling with rats, and Louis
     is following them. A man passes with a lantern.

                    MAN
          Don't go that way Monsieur. It's
          the plague. Go back the way you
          came.

     Louis smiles bitterly at these words, repeating them to
     himself.

                    LOUIS
          The way I came...

     He walks on, following the rats.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          ... and finally, when I could stand
          it no longer, I stood in an empty
          desolate street and heard the sound
          of a child crying.

     A house, the door slightly open, marked with an X. The
     sound of a child crying inside. Louis walks towards it.


     INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

     A little girl, pulling at a figure in a rocking chair.

                    CLAUDIA
          Mama, please wake up. Mama, I'm
          frightened, please wake up.

     As Louis enters, he sees the woman is dead. Her eyes
     are being eaten away by rats.

     Louis gasps in horror. Claudia turns. She is a radiant
     doll or angel as she stretches out her hand to Louis.

                    CLAUDIA
          Monsieur, please help us. Papa's
          waiting for us at the ship. Please
          wake mama, Monsieur.

     She runs to him. Instinctively, he gathers her in his
     arms. He looks down pitying on her beautiful face.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          And if I am damned, why do I fell
          such pity for her gaunt face? Why
          do I wish to warm her tiny arms?
          Comfort her beating heart?

     She snuggles into him, suddenly utterly secure. She
     tugs at his hair, brings his head down towards her. And
     we see Louis shiver, as his lips go to her neck.

     Her breathing becomes calm as she goes into the swoon.
     Gradually another sound replaces it.

     LESTAT'S LAUGHTER, GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER.

     Suddenly Louis backs away, caught red-handed, the child
     in his arms. He sees Lestat slapping his knee and
     laughing in the doorway.

                    LESTAT
          Ah, my philosopher, my martyr.
          "Never take a human life". Well you
          must admit it is funny. Or is it
          merely touching? I'm not sure.

     Louis stares at the unconscious Claudia in horror, then
     lets her slip gently into a chair. Shamefully he wipes
     his mouth, sees the tiny wounds on her throat.

     Lestat snatches up the dead mother from the chair and
     begins to dance with her in great circles, humming and
     talking. Her head falls back. Black water flows from
     her mouth.

                    LESTAT
          Let's make some party of it, shall
          we? Maybe there's some life in the
          old lady yet?

     Louis flees into the street.

                    LESTAT
          Come back, Louis, you are what you
          are. The plague would have got her
          within hours anyway. Merciful Death
          how you love your precious guilt.


     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

     Louis running through an assortment of streets. All the
     night life of New Orleans flows by him.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          For years I had not savored a
          human. And when I had Lestat's
          words made sense to me. I knew
          peace only when I killed and when I
          heard her heart in that terrible
          rhythm I knew again what peace
          could be. Yet even then I could not
          contenance it...


     EXT. WATERFRONT - DAWN

     Fingers of light in the sky. Louis, pale and shivering,
     walks splashing through the water. He comes to a huge
     sewer-pipe, crowded with rats. He crawls inside.


     EXT. WATERFRONT - SOME EVENINGS LATER

     The same sewer-pipe. Now the bodies of dead rats lie
     all around. A pair of fine leather boots splash through
     the water - Lestat's.


     INT. SEWER-PIPE - EVENING

     Louis huddled there, so pale and shivering he seems
     close to death. Lestat comes through.

                    LESTAT
          All I need to find you Louis is
          follow the corpses of rats.

     He bends down to him, surprisingly gently and puts his
     own coat around him.

                    LESTAT
          Pain is terrible for you. You feel
          it like no other creature because
          you are a vampire. You don't want
          it to go on.

                    LOUIS
          No...

     They emerge from the sewer and walk along the
     waterfront.

                    LESTAT
          Do what it is in your nature to do.
          And you will feel as you felt with
          that child in your arms.

                    LOUIS
          Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt
          an end to the craving.

                    LESTAT
          That and more.

     He puts his arm around Louis, to stop his shivering.

                    LESTAT
          Evil is a point of view. God kills,
          indiscriminately, and so shall we.
          For no creatures under God are as
          we are, none so like him as
          ourselves.

                    LOUIS
          Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?

                    LESTAT
          Ah, but we have even more in common
          with our creator. come, I am like a
          mother tonight. I want a child.

     Louis is baffled. He follows.


     INT. INN - SUPPER ROOM

     Lestat enters.

                    LESTAT
          She's here, your wounded one.

                    LOUIS
          What are you saying?

                    LESTAT
          You need company, Louis. More
          congenial than mine...

     Lestat holds up a candle and walks towards a large four-
     poster bed. Claudia lies there, angelic, under the
     coverlet, two marks on her neck.

                    LOUIS
          Lestat!

                    LESTAT
          You remember how you wanted her,
          the taste of her -

                    LOUIS
          I didn't want to kill her.

                    LESTAT
          Don't worry, Louis, you're
          conscience is clear. You left her
          alive.

     Lestat shakes her gently.

                    LESTAT
          Claudia, Claudia, listen to me.
          You're ill, my precious and I'm
          going to give you what you need to
          get well.

                    LOUIS
          Lestat, what do you mean?

     Louis runs at him, but Lestat brushes him aside
     effortlessly, so he falls to the floor. Lestat bites
     his wrist and presses the bleeding wound to the child's
     mouth... He winces in pain.

                    LESTAT
          That's it dear. More. You must
          drink it to get well.

     Claudia sucks on the wound, reviving, making little
     noises like a person waking from sleep.

     Louis rises to his feet as Claudia clutches Lestat's
     arm, sucking the blood fiercely. Lestat moans.

                    LESTAT
          Stop, that's enough. No more.

     He pulls her loose and she growls and stares at him
     with big clear astonished eyes.

                    CLAUDIA
          I want more.

                    LOUIS
          What have you done?

     Lestat puts her down on the bed and sits beside her,
     holding his wrist, obviously in pain.

                    CLAUDIA
          More.

                    LESTAT
          Yes, cherie, of course you want
          more. And I'll show you how to get
          it. You drink from morals, my
          beauty, but from me? Never again.

     Still suffering, Lestat pulls the bell-rope.


     CLOSE ON CLAUDIA

     Being transformed. Becoming white yet robust, bright-
     eyed yet crazed. She shakes her beautiful curls and the
     dust falls from them. They are shining in the
     candlelight.

     Louis cannot stop looking at her. He does not notices
     as -

     The MAID enters.

                    MAID
          Ah, quelle Belle enfant!

     The maid comes near the bed, kneels in front of
     Claudia. Lestat lays his hand on the maid's throat and
     Claudia watches keenly.

                    LESTAT
          Gently, cherie. They are so
          innocent. They must not be made to
          suffer.

     Claudia lunges for the throbbing vein in the neck,
     locking on to the flowing blood.

     The Maid is transfixed.

     Close on Louis, his anguish, his fascinated horror.

                    LOUIS
          You are the devil! You are the
          instrument of Satan!

                    LESTAT
          That's enough, cherie. Stop before
          the heart stops.

     He lets the dead maid onto the floor. Claudia looks at
     the corpse.

                    CLAUDIA
          I want some more.

                    LESTAT
          It's bet in the beginning, lest the
          death takes you down with it. yes,
          that's it. My child. My beloved
          child.

     Lestat and Claudia sit on the Louis XVI settee. Claudia
     is a vision, a doll made out of pearl. Animated, voice
     crisp.

                    CLAUDIA
          Where is Mamma?

     The words echo in Louis' head, as he puts his hands to
     his ears.

                    LESTAT
          Mamma's gone to Heaven, cherie,
          like that sweet lady over there.
          They all go to Heaven. And you did
          very well, cherie. Not a drop
          spilt. Very good! You're going to
          be our child now.

     Lestat takes out his comb and begins to comb her hair.

                    LESTAT
          Your mama's left you with us. She
          wants you to be happy.

                    LOUIS
               (whispers)
          You are the devil! You are the
          instrument of Satan!

                    LESTAT
          Shhhh! Do you want to frighten our
          little daughter?

                    CLAUDIA
          I'm not your daughter.

                    LESTAT
          Yes you are, my dearest. You are
          mine and Louis' daughter. You see
          Louis was going to leave us. He was
          going to go away. But now he's not.
          He's going to stay and make you
          happy.

     Claudia runs over to him. She smiles at him.

                    CLAUDIA
          Lou...eee...

     Louis is conflicted. He cannot leave her. He touches
     her cheeks, her hair. Same as his. Vampire skin and
     hair. He draws in his breath, shocked by her beauty,
     then he embraces her as a father might a daughter. He
     looks over her shoulder to Lestat.

                    LOUIS
          You fiend. You monster.

     Lestat smiles

                    LESTAT
          One happy family.


     INT. ROOM - SAN FRANCISCO

     Malloy is open mouthed.

                    MALLOY
          A child vampire!

     He sees the tape has run out. He rapidly and clumsily
     sticks in another.

                    LOUIS
          Shall we go on?

                    MALLOY
          He did it to make you stay with
          him!

                    LOUIS
          Perhaps. He knew me. He knew I
          would love her more than the waking
          world. But there was more to it
          than that. Perhaps in the end he
          did it - to show me that he could.
          For he lavished affection on her,
          there was no doubt about that. Life
          was very different with madame
          Claudia, as you can imagine...


     EXT. NEW SPANISH TOWNHOUSE - (RUE ROYALE, NEW ORLEANS)

     Two husky movers bring in furniture through the back
     courtyard, past the fountain and the banana trees, up
     the back stairs and into -


     INT. FLAT

     Striped wallpaper gives way to flowers in the bedrooms.
     Huge four-poster beds in the bedrooms, and large
     chests, as big as coffins standing against the wall.
     Everywhere there are candles and pretty Louis XVI
     furniture. Lestat gives instructions to the movers.


     WE MOVE INTO A DIMLY LIT PARLOUR

     We see Claudia draped in lace standing on a petit point
     chair as a DRESSMAKER measure out a garment.

     Louis can be seen, in an inner room.

                    DRESSMAKER
          Monsieur, I need more light. I
          shall go slind if you do not bring
          me a lamp, or let me fit this child
          during the day. Ouch!

     She has pricked her hand. A spot of blood appears on
     her finger Claudia takes her hand.

                    CLAUDIA
          Let me kiss it better...

     Claudia brings the hand to her lips. The dressmaker
     abruptly pulls her finger away, in pain again.

     CLOSEUP - her finger, two holes showing.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          A little child she was, but also a
          fierce killer, now capable of the
          ruthless pursuit of blood with all
          a child's demanding.

     Lestat walks through - sees the dressmaker lying dead
     at Claudia's feet, Claudia still on the chair in the
     half-finished dress.

                    LESTAT
          Claudia, Claudia, will you never
          learn? Who will we get now to
          finish your dress? A little
          practicality, cherie...


     INT. LOUIS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          She would sleep in my coffin,
          daily, curl her child's fingers
          round my hair as she dreamt of I
          know not what...
          
     Claudia and Louis, sleeping in a coffin together,
     Claudia's fingers curling his hair.


     INT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM

     Claudia playing with dolls, each as perfect and
     beautifully dressed as she is.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          Mute and beautiful, she played with
          dolls, dressing them and undressing
          them by the hour.


     INT. PARLOUR - NIGHT

     Claudia tinkling with her child's hands on the piano,
     picking out a hesitant tune.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          Mute and beautiful, she killed. And
          to watch her kill was chilling.


     EXT. SQUARE - NIGHT

     The tinkling of Claudia's piano is heard, over -

     A well-dressed lady, walking through a square lit by
     gaslight. The lady hears a child's sobbing and stops,
     turns.


     POV

     Claudia, the picture of lost innocence, sitting on a
     bench and crying.

                    WOMAN
          Why are you crying, child?

     The woman, all solicitude, goes to Claudia.

                    WOMAN
          Are you lost, my love?

                    CLAUDIA
          Mama...

                    WOMAN
          Hush now, don't cry, We'll find
          her...

                    CLAUDIA
          Mama...

     The woman takes Claudia in her arms. Claudia nestles
     her head in her shoulder, her teeth near her neck.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          They found death fast in those
          days, before she learnt to play
          with the, to delay the moment till
          she had taken what she wanted...


     INT. PARLOUR - NIGHT

     A stern, stiff PIANO-TEACHER (male) beating time with a
     ruler as Claudia picks out scales on the piano. He raps
     her on the knuckles.

                    PIANO-TEACHER
          The thumb girl! Mind the thumb!

     Claudia glares at him, then returns to playing,
     improving rapidly.


     INT. DOLL-SHOP - NIGHT

     Piano music over. Mozart, now well played.

     Claudia staring at a glass case, inside of which are an
     array of eighteenth century dolls. An old DOLLMAKER
     looks down on her.

                    DOLLMAKER
          They are expensive, my dear. Maybe
          too expensive for a young girl like
          you...


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Claudia walking along, clutching the doll.


     INT. DOLL-SHOP - NIGHT

     The dollmaker lying dead, two puncture marks in his
     throat, his dolls scattered all around him.


     EXT. UNDERTAKER'S - NIGHT

     Claudia and Louis looking through the window at a
     display of coffins. Claudia point at the smallest one.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          She grew, yet stayed the same. She
          wanted a bed of her own, yet would
          climb back into mine.


     INT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     The child's coffin on the floor. The lid lifts. Claudia
     emerges, yawning, wanders through the flat into -


     LOUIS' BEDROOM

     Where his coffin sits. She slides the lid off, and
     curls in beside him.


     INT. PARLOUR - NIGHT

     Claudia playing the piano, now with remarkable
     dexterity. The piano-teacher sits mute beside her. As
     she plays, he topples over and falls to the ground. We
     see the puncture-marks in his neck. Lestat, hearing the
     noise, comes in.

                    LESTAT
          Claudia, Claudia! Didn't I tell
          you, never in the house!

     Claudia smiles to herself, keeps playing.


     INT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     CANARIES sing in a cage, above a child's coffin.

     Claudia is writing at a secretaire. She is writing in a
     diary with a quill pen in an adult hand. She murmurs
     the date as she writes.

                    CLAUDIA
          September 21st, one hour after
          sunset. The sky is still violet,
          the way Louis loves and as always
          Lestat was gone when we rose.

     She looks up and sees Louis in the doorway, watching
     her.

                    LOUIS
          How did you learn to write,
          Claudia?

                    CLAUDIA
          The way I learn everything. By
          watching you.

     She closes the diary.

                    CLAUDIA
          But you never let me see you kill,
          Louis.

                    LOUIS
          Lestat taught you all you need to
          know about that.

                    CLAUDIA
          Infant death, he calls me. Sweet
          daughter death. You know what he
          calls you? Merciful death.

                    LOUIS
          He jests.

                    CLAUDIA
          Why does he call you that?

                    LOUIS
          Hush, Claudia don't talk about such
          things. Show me your book.

     She opens it. Inside there is a beautiful pen and ink
     portrait of Louis.

                    LOUIS
          Claudia! You did that?

                    CLAUDIA
          Sit still. It's not finished -

     She begins to fill in the sketch.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          Time can pass fast for mortals when
          they're happy. With us it was the
          same.


     EXT. RUE ROYALE - NIGHT (1800'S)

     Street lamps are oil at this period. Houses are now
     tall two-story Spanish style. Streets are flagstone.
     Passing carriages are black.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          It was a very different life. And a
          new century was beginning. what had
          once been a small godforsaken
          French colony was growing into a
          great port, giving us an endless
          train of magnificent strangers...

     Claudia, Louis and Lestat, dressed in the same clothes
     walking through a raucous carnival with sideshows.
     Crowd milling around, sailors, whores, children,
     thieves, freed slaves, Indians. They pass a Wild West
     display, jugglers, fire-eaters, three-card
     tricksters...

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          All human life was here, for the
          taking. And we took, all three of
          us, in our different ways...

     They come to a raised platform where a troupe of
     perfectly-formed midgets do a burlesque show.

     Claudia stops. She stares, at these small, perfect
     creatures like herself, intrigued and troubled.

     Louis and Lestat walk on, not noticing as -


     CLAUDIA

     Circles the troupe. She comes to a small tent, behind
     it. At the entrance stands a midget youth.

                    YOUTH
          You want to come inside, lovely?

     Claudia walks up to him.

                    YOUTH
          Ever been kissed?

     Claudia shakes her head. He kisses her. Claudia allow
     her to be kissed, then bites his tongue. he youth
     struggles, as Claudia holds him and drains him. She
     lets him go as Louis appears behind her.

                    CLAUDIA
          She's like me, Louis. Small and yet
          not small at all. Like me.

     Louis hurriedly draws her away.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          I watched her grow yet stay the
          same, her doll-like face possessed
          of adult eyes, eerie, powerful,
          seductive...


     INT. FLAT - NIGHT

     Claudia playing the piano, now like a demonic Liszt.
     Louis writing.

     Lestat appears in the doorway. He has a big box in his
     arms.

                    CLAUDIA
          Another doll? I have ten, you
          realize.

     FOCUS ON early 19th Century French dolls - wood, glass,
     wax, bisque - all around the bedroom, on chairs, on the
     bed. Some newish, some tattered old.

                    LESTAT
          Well, I thought you could use
          another.

     He hands her the box. It is a fine Parisian Jumeau
     doll. She likes it and stokes its face.

                    CLAUDIA
          Why always on this night?

                    LESTAT
          What night? What do you mean?

                    CLAUDIA
          You always give me the doll on the
          same night of the year.

                    LESTAT
          I didn't realize.

                    CLAUDIA
          Is this my birthday?

     He examines the other dolls.

                    LESTAT
          Some of these are so old and
          tattered. You should throw them
          away.

                    CLAUDIA
          I have. Or there would be twice as
          many.

                    LESTAT
          But you're the fairest by far.

                    CLAUDIA
          You dress me like a doll. You make
          my hair like a doll. Why?

     Lestat doesn't answer. Claudia stands up quickly, and
     strides out into the -


     PARLOUR

     Where Louis is reading by the window. She walks to a
     mirrored cabinet, takes out a scissors and begins
     cutting her hair.

                    CLAUDIA
          You want me to be a doll forever?

                    LOUIS
          Claudia - don't -

                    CLAUDIA
          Why not?

     She continues cutting. She sees Lestat emerge from her
     bedroom in the mirror behind her then turns to him, an
     angelic little boy's face now with soft curls around
     her face.

                    CLAUDIA
          Can't I change, like everybody
          else?

     She walks past him, back into her bedroom and slams the
     door.

     A beat. Louis looks from the mass of blonde hair on the
     floor to Lestat. Then a HORRID SCREAM pierces the
     silence. More screams, which become roars.


     INT. CLAUDIA'S BEDROOM

     She stands before the dressing-table, all her long hair
     grown back over her shoulders. She holds it with both
     hands, screaming and screaming. Lestat and Louis come
     through the door.

                    CLAUDIA
          Which of you did it? Which of you
          made me the way I am?

                    LESTAT
          What you are? You would be
          something other than you are?

                    CLAUDIA
          And if I cut my hair again?

                    LESTAT
          It will grow back again!

                    CLAUDIA
          But it wasn't always so! I had a
          mother once! And Louis - he had a
          wife! He was mortal the same as
          she! And so was I!

                    LOUIS
          Claudia -

     She turns on Lestat.

                    CLAUDIA
          You made us what we are, didn't
          you?

                    LESTAT
          Stop her Louis!

                    CLAUDIA
          DID YOU DO IT TO ME????

     She runs at him with the scissors, scoring his face.
     The cut heals. She scores it again. It heals again. She
     stares at him in horror.

                    CLAUDIA
               (whispering)
          How did you do it?

                    LESTAT
          And why should I tell you? It's in
          my power.

                    CLAUDIA
          Why yours alone? Tell me how it was
          done!!!!

                    LESTAT
          Be glad I made you what you are!
          You'd be dead not if I hadn't.

     He storms out. Louis goes to Claudia and picks her up
     in his arms.

                    LOUIS
               (tenderly)
          We're immortal. You've always known
          that.

                    CLAUDIA
          Tell me why... you've got to tell
          me...

     Louis carries her outside, onto the porch. There is an
     old flower-seller going by.

                    LOUIS
          You see the old woman? That will
          never happen to you. You'll never
          grow old. You will never die.

                    CLAUDIA
          And it means something else too,
          doesn't it? I shall never, ever
          grow up.

     She clutches Louis desperately.

                    CLAUDIA
          I hate him. But I cannot bear to
          lose you. You're the only companion
          I have, forever. You taught me
          everything I know. Please tell me
          Louis. Tell me how it came to be
          that I am this... thing...

     Louis strokes her beautiful face, her hair.

                    LOUIS
          Come... I've something to show
          you...


     EXT. NEW ORLEANS STREETS - NIGHT

     Louis walking, holding Claudia as if he was about to
     lose her.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          Though everything was changed,
          through the years had warped the
          contours of the streets, I found my
          way there, aware that I'd always
          known where it was and avoided it,
          not wanting to pass the doorway
          where I'd first heard Claudia cry.

     Louis back in the same street, outside the same house.
     He stands with Claudia at the window. There is a family
     inside, a picture of domestic tranquility.

                    LOUIS
          I heard you crying. You were there
          in a room with your mother. You
          were hugging her for warmth, crying
          pitifully as you had been for days.
          Because your mother was dead...

     Claudia stares at him, suddenly very cold, very alert.

                    LOUIS
          I opened the shutters... I came
          into the room... I felt pity for
          you. Pity, but something else.

     He can't go on. Claudia's eyes are remorseless.

                    CLAUDIA
          You... fed on me?

                    LOUIS
          And he found me with you. I ran,
          sickened at what I'd done. Then he
          cut his wrist and fed you from him.
          I tried to stop him, but you were a
          vampire then. And have been every
          night hereafter.

                    CLAUDIA
          You both did it?

                    LOUIS
          I took your life. He gave you
          another one.

     Claudia speaks through indrawn breath.

                    CLAUDIA
          And here it is. And I hate you
          both.

     She runs.


     INT. ROOM SAN FRANCISCO

     Malloy and Louis.

                    MALLOY
          But why did you tell her?

                    LOUIS
          How could I not? She had to know.

                    MALLOY
          And did you lose her? Did she go?

                    LOUIS
          Where would she have gone? She was
          a child, and beautiful,
          heartbreaking merciless child. And
          I had made her that...


     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

     Louis, walking the streets, shivering.

                    LOUIS
          I walked all night. I walked as I
          walked years before when my mind
          swam with guilt at the thought of
          killing. I found myself at the
          Cathedral.

     A cathedral rising out of the mist, the doors open.

                    LOUIS
          I thought of all the things I had
          done and couldn't undo. And I
          longed for one second's peace...

     Louis walks towards the doors, inside.


     INT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

     Louis enters. The dim lights of candles. A sacristan
     tending the altar, an old woman praying - otherwise
     empty.

                    LOUIS
          I had no fear. If anything I longed
          for something to happen, for the
          stones to tremble as I entered the
          foyer.

     Louis walking down the nave of the church. He stops by
     the alter.

                    LOUIS
          I almost genuflected from old
          habit. I almost prayed.

     Louis sits in a pew.

                    LOUIS
          And then it struck me.


     LOUIS' POV

     The cross, the statues, the tabernacle.

                    LOUIS
          What if the statues gave an image
          to nothing? What if I was the
          supernatural in this cathedral? The
          only immortal under this roof. And
          I felt nothing but loneliness.
          Loneliness to the point of madness.

     Suddenly a hand is laid on his shoulder. Louis almost
     jumps. He turns and sees the face of a grey-haired
     priest.

                    PRIEST
          You wish to go to confession? I was
          about to lock up the church.

     Louis stares at him, tears in his eyes.

                    PRIEST
          You are troubled, aren't you? Can I
          help?

                    LOUIS
          It's too late, too late -

                    PREIST
          No, it's never too late. Come...

     The priest gestures to the confessional. Louis rises,
     slowly.


     INT. CONFESSIONAL

     Louis, kneeling in the darkness. The hatch slides back.

                    LOUIS
          Bless me father for I have sinned
          so often and so long, I don't know
          how to change nor beg for
          forgiveness.

                    PRIEST
          Son, God is infinite in his
          capacity to forgive. Tell him from
          your heart.

                    LOUIS
          Murders, father, death after death.
          The woman who died two nights ago
          in Jackson Square, I killed her.
          And thousands of others before her.
          I have walked the streets of New
          Orleans like the Grim reaper. And
          fed on human life for my own. I am
          a vampire, father, and have turned
          the one I love most of all into on
          too -

     The hatch slams down. Louis rises, confused, and the
     door is flung open, the priest stands there.

                    PRIEST
          Do you know the meaning of
          sacrilege?

     Louis rises. Walks out.

                    LOUIS
          Then there is no mercy.

     His face comes into the light. The priest steps back,
     open-mouthed.

                    LOUIS
          You talk of sacrilege. Why if God
          exists does he suffer me to exist?

     He bares his fangs. The priest runs, screaming. Gets to
     the bellrope, begins to ring the bell. Louis swoops on
     him.

                    LOUIS
          Why does he suffer me to live?

     Louis takes him, lifting him from the floor, till his
     feet stop kicking.


     INT. FLAT - NIGHT

     Louis enters, silently, like a corpse. He hears a voice
     behind him.

                    CLAUDIA
          Locked together in hatred -

     He turns, sees her sitting in the darkness. She is
     wearing a tiny nightgown of stitched lace and pearls,
     weirdly adult and seductive. She comes towards him.

                    CLAUDIA
          But I can't hate you Louis.

     She sprays perfume over her body as she comes nearer.

                    CLAUDIA
          Is this the aroma of a mortal
          child?

     She whispers.

                    CLAUDIA
          Louis. Lover.

     She kisses his cheek.

                    CLAUDIA
          I was mortal to you. You gave me
          your immortal kiss. You became my
          mother and my father. And so I'm
          yours. Forever.

     She takes his face in her hands.

                    CLAUDIA
          But now's the time to end it,
          Louis. Now's the time to leave him.

                    LOUIS
          He'll never let us go.

     Claudia smiles.

                    CLAUDIA
          Oh... really?


     EXT. DOCKLANDS - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

     A sailing ship, by the docks. Louis and Claudia talking
     to a shipping-clerk.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          So we made plans. She was convinced
          there were others of our kind in
          Europe, that they would have the
          answers Lestat couldn't provide.
          Lestat whom she now hated, who she
          thought she could be free of. I
          doubted, but then she had a
          surprise in store...


     INT. FLAT - NIGHT

     Lestat playing the piano. Louis reading. Claudia
     enters, wearing a cape and hat. She walks to the piano,
     sits at the end of the piano and stares at him as he
     plays.

                    LESTAT
          What is it now? You irritate me!
          Your very presence irritates me!

                    CLAUDIA
               (sweetly)
          Does it?

                    LESTAT
          Yes. And I'll tell you something
          else! I've met someone who will
          make a better vampire than both of
          you.

                    CLAUDIA
          Is that supposed to frighten me?

                    LESTAT
          You're spoilt because you're an
          only child. You need a brother. Or
          I do. I'm weary of you both.

                    CLAUDIA
          I suppose we could people the world
          with vampires, the three of us.

                    LESTAT
          Not you my dear.

                    CLAUDIA
          You're a liar. But you upset my
          plans.

                    LESTAT
          What plans?

                    CLAUDIA
          I came to make peace with you, even
          if you're the father of lies. I
          want things to be as they were.

     Louis perks up, puzzled.

                    LESTAT
          Stop pestering me then!

                    CLAUDIA
          Oh, Lestat. I must do more than
          that. I've brought a present for
          you.

                    LESTAT
          Then I hope its a beautiful woman
          with endowments you will never
          possess.

     Claudia stares at him for a moment.

                    CLAUDIA
          Better than that.

     She takes his hand and leads him into an inner room.
     Louis follows behind.

                    CLAUDIA
          You haven't fed enough. I can tell
          by your color.


     INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     Two beautiful youths, lying asleep on a couch, by a
     table full with a half-eaten meal. Lestat sighs.

                    LESTAT
          Oh, Claudia, you've outdone
          yourself. Where did you find them?

                    CLAUDIA
          Drunk on brandy wine. A thimbleful.
          I thought of you when I saw them.

                    LESTAT
          We forgive each other then?

     Claudia stares at him, sitting. She nods.

     Lestat bites into the neck of one of the youths, sucks
     greedily and horribly. Claudia watches him without
     expression. He finished one, is about to take the other
     when he staggers. He looks at Claudia.

                    LESTAT
          Absinthe? You gave them absinthe?

                    CLAUDIA
          No. Laudanum.

     Lestat stares wildly at her, tries to move towards her,
     then slips to the floor.

                    LESTAT
          Laudanum!

                    CLAUDIA
          Yes. It killed them, unfortunately.
          But it keeps the blood warm.

     Lestat tries to rise.

                    LESTAT
          Ah Louis, Louis, she killed them...
          and let me drink...

     Louis watches, appalled. He goes to move.

                    CLAUDIA
          Don't Louis -

                    LESTAT
          Louis, put me in my coffin...

                    CLAUDIA
          I'll put you in your coffin.
          Forever.

     She pulls a knife out from under her shawl, walks
     rapidly to him and slashes his throat. Blood explodes
     from it.

                    LOUIS
          Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!

                    LESTAT
          Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift -
          help me -

     Claudia lacerates his face. Blood pours from
     everywhere. She plunges the knife in his chest. He
     falls back, fangs bared, clutching the knife. Claudia
     leaps on him then, bites deep into his neck as he dies.
     Louis screams, runs forward, pulls her away.

                    LOUIS
          What have you done, Claudia -

     He drags her off Lestat, tries to pull her out of the
     room. She hisses at him.

                    CLAUDIA
          Louis! Look what's happening to
          him!!

     Louis looks. The floor is a sea of blood. Lestat has
     begun to shrivel, as if he'd been a bag of blood. His
     skin is shriveling against his bones like parchment,
     his eyes are slipping back into his skull-like face.
     His lush, beautiful hair remains unchanged. But his
     clothes are virtually being emptied of the body. It is
     no more than bones, wrapped in paper and the pupils of
     the eyes suddenly roll up into the papered skull.

                    LOUIS
          Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.

                    CLAUDIA
          Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.

     She stares at the shriveled skeleton in its skin
     wrapping. She is fascinated. She sees the vampiric
     blood flow all over the floor. She touches it and
     brings her finger to her lips.

                    CLAUDIA
          Goodnight, sweet prince, may
          flights of devils wing you to your
          rest.

     Louis walks forward, touches the skeleton, the blonde
     hair.

                    LOUIS
          He's dead, Claudia, dead.

                    CLAUDIA
          The one good lesson he taught me,
          Louis. Never drink from the dead.

     She stands up, all business suddenly.

                    CLAUDIA
          Help me. We must get rid of him.

     She drags the coverlet from the table, knocking the
     crockery over the dead youths, and wraps Lestat's
     skeleton in it. She takes a bunch of chrysanthemums and
     places them in his skeleton hands.

                    CLAUDIA
          Should we burn him? Bury him? What
          would he have liked, Louis?

                    LOUIS
          Don't mock, Claudia...

                    CLAUDIA
          The swamp...


     EXT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT

     Louis whipping the horses. Claudia beside him. Lestat's
     skeleton in the back, with the bodies of the two dead
     youths.

                    CLAUDIA
          In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our
          own kind. Find the one who made
          him. Learn what it means.

                    LOUIS
          And suppose the one who made him
          knows nothing and the vampire who
          made him knows nothing, and it goes
          back, nothing proceeding from
          nothing, until there is nothing!
          And we must live with the knowledge
          that there is no knowledge.
          
     The carriage pulls up by a swamp. Mist everywhere.
     Overhanging creepers.

                    LOUIS
          And if we find the one who made
          him? Do we tell him we destroyed
          his own creation? The vampire
          Lestat?

     Louis drags out the bodies of the boys. He slides them
     into the waters of the swamp. We see ripples in the
     water and the churning of alligators, as they attack
     the corpses. Louis takes Lestat's skeleton in his arms.
     He slides it into the waters. The alligators speed
     towards it.

                    CLAUDIA
          He belongs with those reptiles,
          Louis. He deserved to die.

                    LOUIS
          Then maybe so do we. Every night of
          our lives. He was my brother. My
          maker. He gave me this life,
          whatever it is.

                    CLAUDIA
          I did it for us, Louis. So we could
          be free.

     He stands there, saying nothing.

                    CLAUDIA
          Louis, look at me.

                    LOUIS
               (bitterly)
          I can't. Go away from me.

     Claudia is shocked to her core. She steps back. Louis
     stares at the rippling waters. Gradually the movement
     of alligators stops. Then he hears a sound he hasn't
     heard in years. Soft, choking. He turns, sees Claudia
     sitting by a cypress tree, like a little girl for the
     first time in years. She is weeping copiously.

                    LOUIS
          Claudia - You're crying -

     We see her face, tears of blood running down it. She is
     heartbroken, lost.

                    CLAUDIA
          You never talked to me like that -
          in all these years.

                    LOUIS
          And you never cried -

                    CLAUDIA
          I can't bear it when you do - I
          would die rather than lose you
          Louis. I would die the way he died.

     Louis gathers her in his arms.

                    LOUIS
          Hush, Claudia, hush now my dear -

                    CLAUDIA
          Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I
          did it for you -

     Louis walks her towards the carriage.

                    LOUIS
          I love you Claudia. Always. And we
          are free now, Claudia. No Lestat.
          Just the two of us, beginning the
          great adventure of our lives.

     He lifts her into the carriage and drives off, leaving
     the silent waters of the swamp.


     INT. FLAT - NIGHT

     Sturdy mulatto workmen lifting cases and trunks out of
     the apartment. All the furniture is covered in white
     sheets. Claudia dressed in a cap and hat, is playing
     the piano by the light of one remaining oil-lamp.

     Louis comes from her room with the cage of canaries.

                    LOUIS
          The birds. We forgot about the
          birds. There's nothing for it but
          to let them go.

     He opens the cage, and the canaries fly around the
     room.

     There is a knocking on the door. Claudia falters.

                    CLAUDIA
          What was that?

                    LOUIS
          The workmen must have a trunk -
          don't stop, cherie -

     He goes downstairs. Claudia plays a moment, then stops,
     perturbed. She goes to the window. Then sees something
     out there that makes her face go white. She screams.

                    CLAUDIA
          Louis!!!


     THE STAIRWAY

     Louis walking to the door. The knocking gets louder.


     THE PARLOUR

     Claudia runs for the stairs, after Louis.


     THE HALLWAY

     Louis reaches the door. The knocking gets louder. He
     opens the door as -


     CLAUDIA

     Reaches the stairs. She screams -

                    CLAUDIA
          Don't Louis -

     But Louis has opened the door. Nothing there. He looks
     back at Claudia, puzzled, then at the door again when,
     swooping into his vision comes the nightmare image of -


     LESTAT

     In filthy swamp-soaked rags, robust again, but his
     flesh shriveled, covered in scars, his eyes riddled,
     bloodshot. he roars.

                    LESTAT
          WHERE IS SHE? WHERE IS THAT
          ACCURSED CHILD?

     Louis throws his body against the door, slamming it on
     Lestat's reaching hand. The hand withdraws, as Lestat
     roars. Louis bolts the door.

     Louis runs up the stairs, sweeps Claudia in his arms,
     watching appalled as the door shudders with the force
     of Lestat's body.


     IN THE PARLOUR

     Louis runs through with Claudia in his arms.

                    LOUIS
          It can't be -

                    CLAUDIA
          It is! Take the back stairwell -

     Suddenly Lestat crashes through the casement window,
     scattering blood everywhere, reefing himself on the
     shattered glass. He tumbles to the floor and gets
     unsteadily to his feet.

                    LESTAT
          GIVE ME HER LOUIS!!

     Louis throws Claudia behind him and hurls himself on
     Lestat, who fights like a ravening animal, bits of his
     broken body coming off in the process. Then with a
     terrifying effort, Lestat hurls Louis off, goes for
     Claudia, who grabs the poker from the fireplace,
     scatters burning coals over him. He falls back, then
     comes at her again, as the drapes catch fire. Louis
     grabs the lamp.

                    LOUIS
          Stay back - for the love of God...
          or I'll burn you alive...

     Lestat lunges again at Claudia.

     Louis hurls the lamp, which explodes him in flame.

     Lestat screams in agony, whirls around the room, then
     comes on Claudia again. She hurls another lamp.

     Louis throws the flaming sheets around him, wrapping
     him further in fire. Lestat falls to his knees,
     choking, hands up over his face in the smoke. The whole
     parlor is afire. Louis gathers up Claudia, smothering
     the burning house, carries her down the back stairs,
     through the carriage way and through the gathering
     crowds of mortals into the street.


     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Louis running, with Claudia in his arms. He looks back
     at the flames of the house. Sound of a ship's horn.

                    CLAUDIA
          The ship is sailing without us!

                    LOUIS
          Not yet. Holding her tightly, Louis
          runs.


     EXT. DECK OF SHIP - NEAR DAWN

     Louis stands at the railings in the morning mist as the
     ship moves down the river. He sees...


     CITY OF NEW ORLEANS

     With flame lighting up the sky.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          Though the fire seemed to spread
          through the quartier, I stood on
          that deck until dawn, fearful he
          would come out again of the very
          river like some monster to destroy
          us both. And all the while I
          thought, Lestat, we deserve your
          vengeance. You gave me the dark
          gift. And I delivered you into the
          hands of death for the second time.


     INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO

     Louis and Malloy.

                    MALLOY
          Did he die in the fire?

                    LOUIS
          He was dead to us. We were free.
          That was all that mattered.


     EXT. SHIP - EVENING

     The ship, shrouded in mist.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          Though the ship was blessedly free
          of rats, a strange plague
          nonetheless struck its passengers.

     A body is slipped into the sea. A priest reads last
     rites to a mourning family.


     INT. SHIPS HOLD

     Trunks and cases, creaking with the ship's movement.
     Dead rats everywhere.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          Claudia and I alone seemed immune.
          We kept to ourselves, pondering the
          mystery of Lestat and the greater
          mystery of each other.
          

     EXT. SHIP - NIGHT

     Passing through the Straits of Gibralter.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          We reached the Mediterranean. I
          wanted those waters to be blue.
          They were black, nighttime waters
          and how I suffered then, straining
          to remember the color that a young
          man's senses had taken for granted,
          that my memory had let slip away
          for eternity. It was black off the
          coast of Italy, black off the coast
          of Greece, Europe itself was black.
          

     EXT. DECK - NIGHT

     Claudia, sitting with an easel and sketch-pad,
     sketching the bay of Naples. A beautifully realized
     drawing, all in shades of grey and black. Louis
     observes.

                    CLAUDIA
          Louis, your quest is for darkness
          only. This sea is not your sea.
          They myths of men are not your
          myths. Their history isn't yours.

     The sketch changes to a sketch of -


     THE ACROPOLIS

     In the moonlight.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          We saw the Acropolis by moonlight,
          shades of grey and silver. And I
          longed for the brilliant white of
          those marbles in the hot sun of
          Homer...

     The sketch changes to a sketch of -


     TRANSYLVANIA

     And the traditional shapes of the vampire landscape.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          We docked at Varna and searched the
          rural countryside of the
          Carpathians, for what she liked to
          term "our kind"...

          vampires filled me with bitterness.
          We searched village after village,
          ruin after ruin and I was glad when
          always we found nothing. For what
          could the damned really have to say
          to the damned?


     INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO

     Malloy and Louis.

                    MALLOY
          You found nothing?

                    LOUIS
          Peasant rumors, superstitions about
          garlic, crosses, stakes in the
          hear, all that - how do you say
          again? Bull shit. But one of our
          kind? Not a whisper.

                    MALLOY
          No vampires in Transylvania? No
          Count Dracula?

                    LOUIS
          Fictions, my friend. The vulgar
          fictions of a demented Irishman...
          So we repaired to Paris...


     EXT. BOULEVARD FACADE OF GRAND HOTEL AND PARIS OPERA

     Crowds and gaslight everywhere. Carriages, horses,
     OPERA coming from the opera house.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          I think the very name of Paris
          brought a rush of pleasure to me
          that was extraordinary. I was a
          Creole, after all and Paris was the
          mother of New Orleans, a universe
          whole and entire unto herself...


     EXT. 18TH CENTURE PALACES ALONG THE SEINE - NIGHT

     The high walls of the Louvre, dark figures walking in
     pairs through the shadowy tulieries.


     EXT. STREET - SHOP WINDOW

     Claudia, in furtrimmed muff and bonnet, peers through
     the glass at a display of dolls. Each doll in there
     seems to resemble her, with blonde hair and blue eyes.
     She peers deep into the shop and sees -

     MADELEINE, a young woman bent over a workbench painting
     a doll's face, oblivious to being watched.


     INT. OPERA STAIRCASE

     Louis and Claudia hurrying hand in hand with a crowd of
     mortals towards the sound of an ORCHESTRA TURNING
     beyond.


     INT. NOTRE DAME

     Claudia and Louis standing in the deep shadows, looking
     at the branching arches. Louis is overcome with
     sadness, Claudia is fascinated.


     INT. GALLERY

     Louis and Claudia walk among a series of mythological
     nudes by Poussin.


     INT. SALON - NIGHT

     Claudia, surrounded by discarded dresses and outfits,
     being attended by couturiers. All the clothes are tiny,
     to fit her frame, but have an adult cut and shape.

                    LOUIS
          We were alive again. We were in
          love and so euphoric was I that I
          yielded to her every desire...


     INT. SUMPRUOUS HOTEL SUITE

     Full of late 19th century furniture, lots of Empire
     style, Regency, gilt, velvet and brocade.


     CLOSE ON A HUGE BLACK EBONY CHEST

     Against a wall, solemn among all the light and glitter.


     CLAUDIA

     By a large gilt mirror, in her new clothes. She is
     covered with jewelry, fixing earrings to her ears.

                    CLAUDIA
          Help me, mon chere...

     Louis walks over, helps her with the earrings.

                    CLAUDIA
          How do I look?

                    LOUIS
          Still my beautiful child.

     Claudia laughs.

                    CLAUDIA
          A beautiful child! Is that what you
          still think I am?

                    LOUIS
          Yes...

     He turns away.

                    CLAUDIA
          Why do you turn away? Why don't you
          look.

     She twirls, looking at herself in the mirror, then
     stops, stares at herself.

                    CLAUDIA
          You want me to be your daughter
          forever, don't you?

                    LOUIS
          Yes.

                    CLAUDIA
          Well tell me, papa. What was it
          like making love?

     Louis is stunned. He blushes.

                    CLAUDIA
          You don't remember? Or you never
          knew.

                    LOUIS
          It was something hurries...and
          seldom savored... something acute
          that was quickly lost. It was the
          pale shadow of killing.

                    CLAUDIA
          But how will I ever know, Louis?

     She stares at him through the mirror.

                    CLAUDIA
          I'll never find them, will I? My
          own kind...


     EXT. BOULEVARD - EVENING

     Louis and Claudia walk along a boulevard like father
     and daughter. All around them are bourgeois Parisian
     families on their evening stroll. Claudia points at the
     children that pass.

                    CLAUDIA
          Have I anything in common with her,
          Louis?

     She points to a beautiful French child walking by with
     her mother.

                    CLAUDIA
          Or her, or her - or any of them?

                    LOUIS
          Claudia, you torture yourself.

                    CLAUDIA
          They are ducklings, that will grow
          into swans. Whereas I must be the
          duckling forever.

                    LOUIS
          You are more beautiful than any of
          them.


     EXT. DOLL-SHOP - NIGHT

     We see Madeleine, inside, painting a doll's face. Louis
     and Claudia arrive outside.

                    CLAUDIA
          All her dolls resemble me.


     POV

     Claudia's face, with the dolls in the background. The
     resemblance is uncanny.

                    CLAUDIA
          Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never
          change either.

                    LOUIS
          You are neither, Claudia. Now stop
          this -

     Madeleine sees Claudia from inside. She waves.

                    LOUIS
          You know her?

                    CLAUDIA
          Yes. Should I take her, Louis?
          Among her dolls? make a doll of her
          in turn?

                    LOUIS
          Come, Claudia...

     He takes her arm. But Claudia shakes him off, and moves
     into the shop.


     EXT. LATIN QUARTER - NIGHT

     Louis walks briskly, head bowed.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          For a time we had been almost
          human, in the sensual whirl of what
          Paris had to offer. But the human
          delights of that city only served
          to remind her of the ageless child
          she had become. I felt her pain as
          I walked until I become aware that
          I was being followed.


     CLOSEUP - LOUIS' FEET

     Walking. A step echoes his.

     Louis stops. Turns, sees nothing. Then walks again. The
     echoing steps begin again.

     Louis again. Sees a shadow, flitting.

                    LOUIS
          Claudia!

     Nothing. He walks again, hears the same effect. Then he
     stops. He stares at a gaslamp opposite.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          So it was when I had given up the
          search for vampires that a vampire
          found me...

     Santiago, a tall vampire, materializes under the
     gaslight. And Louis gradually realizes that this
     vampire has assumed the same attitude, posture, clothes
     and hair-style as Louis.

     Louis gives an involuntary shake of the head. Santiago
     mimics. Louis takes a step forwards. Santiago mimics.
     Louis folds his arms. Santiago mimics.

                    LOUIS & STATIAGO
               (simultaneously)
          Clever.

                    LOUIS
          You mean me harm?

                    SANTIAGO
               (a beat later)
          You mean me harm?

     Louis calculates.

                    LOUIS
          Trickster. Buffoon!

     Santiago echoes the first word, but not the second.
     Louis has broken his composure. He turns his back on
     Santiago, only to come face to face with Santiago right
     in front of him.

     Again Louis turns this back to find Santiago facing
     him.

     Louis turns, glowers, refusing to look at him.

                    LOUIS
          I've searched the world for an
          immortal and this is what I find?

     Slowly he looks up. Santiago draws close, breaking the
     mirror trick and suddenly slams Louis back against the
     wall.

     Louis is furious. He regains his balance, strikes out
     at Santiago and when Santiago vanishes, to reappear
     behind him, Louis slams back his elbow into his
     midriff. Santiago staggers, amazed and then rushes at
     Louis, throwing him down.

     Louis rolls back to his feet, then to his amazement
     sees two vampires, on in front, on behind. He looks
     both ways, then sees one has vanished. He stares,
     awestruck, at this new one:

                    ARMAND
          He looks like an angel.

                    ARMAND
          You are all right.

     He reaches into his waistcoat, takes an engraved
     invitation out of his pocket and thrusts it at Louis.

     Louis reads it aloud, as we see:

     "THEATRE DES VAMPIRES
     By Special Invitation
     Friday, 9 p.m."

                    ARMAND
          Bring the petit beauty with you. No
          one will harm you. I won't allow
          it. Remember my name. Armand.

     Armand bows and vanishes.

     Louis listens to the silence.


     EXT BOULEVARD DES CAPUCHINES - THEATRE DES VAMPIRES -
     NIGHT

     Louis formally dressed with Claudia in rich attire on
     his arm. They pass people buying tickets for the
     theatre and go inside.

                    LOUIS
          Remember what I've told you.
          They'll have different powers.
          They'll read your thoughts if you
          allow it.

     They draw close to:


     HUGE POSTERS

     Reading -

     "THEATRE DES VAMPIRES PRESENTS
     THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH
     By Edgar Allen Poe"

     The posters are illustrated with cliched images of
     vampires overcoming damsels in distress.


     ANOTHER ANGLE

                    CLAUDIA
          But this can't be real. This is
          nonsense.

                    LOUIS
          Nonsense all right. But something
          tell me it's going to be the
          strangest nonsense we've ever seen.

     Warily, they show their invitations to the mortal
     ticket taker at the door. He glances away
     indifferently.


     INT. THEATRE BOX - NIGHT

     Claudia and Louis look at the crowd as the lights go
     down.

                    CLAUDIA
          Mortals, mortals everywhere. And
          lots of drops to drink.

                    LOUIS
          They are here. I know they are.
          Listen for something that doesn't
          make a sound.

     Stage: curtain rises.

     An elaborate painted set of an Italianate castle. Death
     standing before it, the traditional image of the Grim
     Reaper, complete with magnificent scythe.

                    LOUIS
               (whispers)
          It's a vampire. It's the one I saw
          in Rue St Jacques.

     A version of the Poe story unfolds before them. All of
     the participants are vampires. All beautiful gleaming
     white, aged 20 or 30.

                    LOUIS
          They use no paint. And the audience
          think it is paint.

                    CLAUDIA
          How devilishly clever.

     A spotlight uncovers a mortal woman suddenly forced out
     upon the stage.

                    CLAUDIA
          She's no vampire.

                    LOUIS
          No. She's frightened. She doesn't
          know where she is.

     The audience laughs uneasily, then stops as the Mortal
     Woman comes into the footlights. She is too beautiful,
     too confused. Santiago, as Death, advances on her. She
     backs away, terrified, then sees the other vampires, in
     a phalanx, advancing from behind, in a half-circle.

                    MORTAL WOMAN
          I don't want to die!

     She looks around in panic. Santiago swoons, arms over
     his breast as if he is hopelessly in love.

                    SANTIAGO
          We are death!

     The Mortal Woman steps to the footlights.

                    MORTAL WOMAN
          Someone help me. Please... What
          have I done?

     Louis whispers to Claudia.

                    LOUIS
          This is no performance.

                    CLAUDIA
          And no one knows but us...


     ON THE STAGE

                    SANTIAGO
          We all die. Death is the one thing
          you share with all those here.

     Santiago gestures to the audience.


     AUDIENCE

     Rapt faces.


     ON THE STAGE

                    MORTAL WOMAN
          But I'm young...

                    SANTIAGO
          Death is no respecter of age. He
          can come any time, any place. Need
          I tell you what fate has in store
          for you?

                    MORTAL WOMAN
          I would take my chance. Let me go!
          Please...

                    SANTIAGO
          And if you take that chance and
          live, what is your fate? The
          humpbacked toothless visage of old
          age?

     Santiago approaches her and tears the drawstring out of
     her peasant blouse. It opens completely and starts to
     slip. She tries to catch it, but gently stops her
     wrists. The blouse falls, exposing her young breasts.


     LOUIS AND CLAUDIA

                    LOUIS
          This is monstrous!

                    CLAUDIA
          Yes, and very beautiful.


     ON THE STAGE

                    SANTIAGO
          Just as this flesh is pink now, it
          will turn grey and wrinkle with
          age.

                    MORTAL WOMAN
          Let me live, please. I don't care.

                    SANTIAGO
          Then why should you care if you die
          now?

     She shakes her head, confused. he catches her wrists
     behind her back.


     AUDIENCE

     Is awestruck by her beauty, her suffering.


     SANTIAGO

     Draws near her cheek.

                    SANTIAGO
          And suppose death had a heart to
          love and to release you? To whom
          would he turn his passion? Would
          you pick a person from the crowd
          there? A person to suffer as you
          suffer?


     AUDIENCE

     A young girl cries out in jest.

                    YOUNG GIRL
          Oh, yes, take me Monsieur Vampire!
          I adore you!

     Audience roars with laughter.


     ON THE STAGE

                    SANTIAGO
          You wait your turn.

     The audience laughs again.

     The Mortal Woman shakes her head in panic.

                    SANTIAGO
          Well, have you a sister, a mother,
          a daughter you would send in your
          place?


     CLOSE ON CLAUDIA

     Even she is repelled by the cruelty. She shakes her
     head.


     MORTAL WOMAN

     Shakes her head. She is helpless.

                    SANTIAGO
          We alone can give death meaning. Do
          you know what it means to be loved
          by death, to become our bride?

     Mortal Woman looks up on the verge of hysteria or
     fainting. But then her eyes mist over. She is being
     entranced.


     FROM HER POV

     We realize she is looking past Santiago at the divinely
     beautiful Armand, who has just stepped out of the
     wings. Armand has entranced her. He passes Santiago.
     Santiago stiffens, but yields the stage.

                    ARMAND
          No pain.

                    MORTAL WOMAN
          No pain?

     Armand takes her by the naked shoulders.

                    ARMAND
          Your beauty is a gift to us.


     ON THE STAGE

     Armand gestures to the others who slowly, gracefully
     close in.

                    ARMAND
          Who deserves such a gift?

     He pulls the drawstring from her skirt and it falls
     revealing her nakedness. But she is spellbound.

                    MORTAL WOMAN
          No pain...

     Armand embraces her, drinks, her naked body stark
     against her black clothes, then he passes her to the
     other vampires one by one.


     CLOSE ON LOUIS

     Who battles desire and hunger with anger.

                    LOUIS
          I've seen enough of this! I loathe
          it!

                    CLAUDIA
          Be still!


     ON THE STAGE

     The naked Mortal Woman lies dead on the floor. The
     vampires seem to vanish one by one. As the curtain
     draws across, the Audience loudly applauds what they
     presume are theatrical tricks.


     ANOTHER ANGLE

     The audience, milling towards the exits. They talk in
     vacuous terms about the beauty of the show, the
     symbolism of it, the daring of it as they leave.

     Gradually Louis and Claudia are left alone in the empty
     theatre. Louis seems anxious to leave. Claudia whispers
     in his ear.

                    CLAUDIA
          Patience, Louis. Patience.

     He looks around the empty theatre, more eerie now than
     when the play was on. The red curtain shifts slightly
     in a hidden breeze, a candle sputters and dies in a
     box. Then the candle flares again, and we see Armand in
     the box, looking down on them. He stares with a dreamy
     expression, saying nothing.

                    LOUIS
          We've been searching for you for a
          very long time...

     His voice echoes eerily. Armand gestures for them to
     follow him.


     INT. FOOT OF STAIRWAY

     Armand leading, Louis and Claudia following. It opens
     into a -


     HUGE UNDERGROUND BALLROOM

     Walls are painted with famous copies of Durer,
     Brueghel, Goya and Bosch depictions of death. Fine
     wooden coffins line the walls. Candles burn in sconces,
     casting alternate shadows and pools of light. Armand
     walks through, gesturing Louis and Claudia to follow
     him.

     As they walk through, vampire man and women appear out
     of the shadows like wraiths, startling them, drifting
     around them, stroking them, touching Claudia as if she
     were a doll. Shrieks of preternatural laughter.

     Armand gestures to the vampires to back off.

     All obey but ESTELLE.

                    ESTELLE
          Such a darling.

     She menaces Claudia, her breasts enormous, her fangs
     bared. Armand throw her a look, and she is flung
     against the wall.

     Louis stares around. The vampires faces drift towards
     him and away, always disclosing the face of Armand, who
     seems some distance away, but strangely close, staring
     at Louis with a constantly calm, hypnotic gaze. Then a
     young mortal boy comes from the shadows with a
     candelabra, which he hands to Armand.

     Armand and the boy come towards them, leading them
     along the walls, his candelabra illuminating the
     ghastly murals, his face gleaming like an angel above
     the candleflame.

                    LOUIS
          Monstrous.

                    ARMAND
          Yes, and very beautiful.

                    LOUIS
          Your lips, they didn't move.

                    ARMAND
          They did, but too fast for you to
          see them. No magic, just grace and
          speed.

     The boy is watching Louis. Armand's hand beckons and
     the boy draws up to Louis in the candlelight. He places
     his arms on Louis' shoulders. Louis glances at Armand,
     who smiles. Louis sees the puncture marks on the boy's
     neck.

                    ARMAND
          He wants you...

     Louis is utterly confused. Can't resist. Drinks his
     blood.

     The boy's body presses against him, sensual, willing.
     The other vampires appear all around Louis, who
     suddenly senses it and draws away, ashamed.

     Claudia watches warily, from a distance. Armand beckons
     at her and Louis and open a door in the wall which
     reveals a stone staircase.


     INT. MEDIEVAL ROOM

     Medieval chairs, table, an old coffin, a bed in one
     corner, a blazing fire. A medieval painting of Satan,
     being banished from heaven, above the fire. Armand
     places the boy on the bed, settling him so he sleeps.

                    ARMAND
          Disappointing, isn't it? To come so
          far and find so little. Jaded
          ingenues, amusing themselves with
          make- believe...

                    LOUIS
          We had feared we were the only
          ones...

                    ARMAND
          But how did you come into
          existence?

     He glances at Louis, then at Claudia, who averts her
     eyes.

                    ARMAND
          You don't want to answer... Two
          vampires from the new world, come
          to guide us into the new era as all
          we love slowly rots and fades away.

                    LOUIS
          Are you the leader of this group?

                    ARMAND
          If there were a leader, I would be
          the one.

     Claudia stares at him constantly, guarded.

                    LOUIS
          So you have the answers...

                    ARMAND
          Ah! You have questions?

                    LOUIS
          What are we?

                    ARMAND
          Nothing if not vampires...

                    LOUIS
          Who made us what we are?

                    ARMAND
          Surely you know the one who made
          you...

                    LOUIS
          But the one who made him, who made
          the one who made him, the source of
          all this evil...

     Louis looks at the picture. Armand watches him.

                    ARMAND
          That is a picture, nothing more.

                    LOUIS
          You mean we are not children of
          Satan?

                    ARMAND
          No.

     He smiles at Louis. A smile of infinite compassion.

                    ARMAND
          I understand. I saw you in the
          theatre, your suffering, your
          sympathy for that girl. I saw you
          with the boy. You die when you
          kill, you feel you deserve to die
          and you stint on nothing. But does
          that make you evil? Or, since you
          comprehend what you call goodness,
          does it not make you good?

                    LOUIS
          Then there is nothing.

                    ARMAND
          Perhaps...

     He passes his finger through the candle flame.

                    ARMAND
          And perhaps this is the only real
          evil left...

                    LOUIS
          Then God does not exist...

                    ARMAND
          I have not spoken to him...

                    LOUIS
          And no vampire here has discourse
          with God or the Devil?

                    ARMAND
          None that I've ever known. I know
          nothing of God or the Devil, I have
          never seen a vision nor learnt a
          secret that would damn or save my
          soul. And as far as I know, after
          four hundred years I am the oldest
          living vampire in the world.

     He stares at them, his face angelic, hypnotic, young.
     His eyes hold them both in a trance.

                    LOUIS
          My God... So it's as I always
          feared. Nothing, leading to
          nothing.

                    ARMAND
          You fell too much. So much you make
          me feel...

     He stares from Claudia to Louis. He seems to be reading
     their souls.

                    ARMAND
          The one who made you should have
          told you this. The one who left the
          old world for the new...

                    LOUIS
          He knew nothing. He just didn't
          care.

                    ARMAND
          Knew? You mean he is...

     Claudia appears suddenly to Louis' shoulder,
     interrupting.

                    CLAUDIA
          Come, beloved. It's time we were on
          our way. I'm hungry and the city
          waits.

     She stares hard at Armand. Armand looks from her to
     Louis.

                    ARMAND
          So soon to go?

     He seems genuinely regretful. But Claudia pulls Louis
     out.


     INT. DARKENED CORRIDORS AND THEATRE - NIGHT

     Louis and Claudia feel their way through darkened
     corridors, trying to find their way out.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          The place was dark as we left, a
          darkness that confounded even
          Claudia. And as we blundered
          through it, again came the thought:
          I have wronged Lestat, I have hated
          him for the wrong reasons.

     Suddenly a light comes on. They see they are in the
     empty theatre. Santiago stands on the stage, under a
     candle.

                    SANTIAGO
          How did you wrong him?

     Louis is stunned.

                    LOUIS
          You read my thoughts?

                    SANTIAGO
          You said a name -

                    LOUIS
          A name I don't want to say again.

                    SANTIAGO
          I seemed to recognize it...

     Other vampires appear behind him.

                    SANTIAGO
          There is but one crime among us
          vampires here.

     He looks at Claudia.

                    SANTIAGO
          You should know, who are so
          secretive about the vampire who
          made you.

     Claudia laughs.

                    CLAUDIA
          Boredom!

                    SANTIAGO
          It is the crime that means death to
          any vampire. To kill your own kind!

                    CLAUDIA
          Aaaah! I was so afraid it was to be
          born like Venus out of the foam, as
          we were! Come Louis, let's go!


     EXT. HOTEL SAINT GABRIEL - NIGHT

     Claudia and Louis enter the Lobby.

                    CLAUDIA
          I loathe them! I can't stand the
          sight of them! Stupid bourgeois
          Parisians, all dressed in black
          like some private club! I've
          searched for them the world over
          and I despise them!

                    LOUIS
          What danger?

                    CLAUDIA
          I can feel it from them! They want
          to know who made us, what became of
          him. They have their rules, their
          idiotic rules!

     They come to their room, enter.


     INT. HOTEL ROOMS - NIGHT

     Louis closes the door behind him. Claudia paces.

                    LOUIS
          Do you think I would let them harm
          you?

                    CLAUDIA
          No, you would not, Louis. Danger
          hold you to me.

                    LOUIS
          Love holds you to me. And we are in
          danger, not you.

                    CLAUDIA
          Love?

     She smiles at him. A strange, sad, adult smile.

                    CLAUDIA
          You would leave me for Armand if he
          beckoned you.

                    LOUIS
          Never.

                    CLAUDIA
          He wants you as you want him. He's
          been waiting for you. He wants you
          for a companion. He bides his time
          that place. he finds them as dull
          and lifeless as we do.

                    LOUIS
          That's not so.

                    CLAUDIA
          Do you know what his soul said to
          me without saying a word? When he
          put me in that trance...

                    LOUIS
          So you felt it too!

                    CLAUDIA
          Let him go, he said. Let him go.

     She touches his face.

                    CLAUDIA
          Is that what I should do Louis? Let
          you go? My father? My lover? My
          Louis, who made me?

     There are tears in her eyes. Louis lifts her up in his
     arms.

                    LOUIS
          He can protect us, Claudia.

                    CLAUDIA
          You really believe that?


     EXT. DOLL-SHIP - NIGHT

     Claudia, staring at the dolls. We see Madeleine inside,
     painting a doll. She sees Claudia and smiles and waves.


     INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

     Louis, sitting alone in the box, as the curtains draw
     back, to show Santiago as death, as before. Louis takes
     advantage of the darkness to slip away.


     INT. ARMAND'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Armand opens the door to Louis' knock.

                    ARMAND
          I was waiting for you...

                    LOUIS
          Listen to me.

     He follows Armand into the room.

                    LOUIS
          Claudia is dear to me. My...
          daughter.

                    ARMAND
          Your lover.

                    LOUIS
          No, my beloved, my child.

                    ARMAND
          If you say so. You are innocent.

                    LOUIS
          I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid.
          She feels she's in danger from the
          others.

                    ARMAND
          She is.

                    LOUIS
          But why?

                    ARMAND
          I could give you reasons. Her
          silence. Her youth. It's forbidden
          to make so young, so helpless, that
          cannot survive on its own.

                    LOUIS
          Then blame the one who made her...

                    ARMAND
          Did you kill this vampire who made
          you both? Is that why you won't say
          his name? Santiago thinks you did.

                    LOUIS
          We want no quarrel with him.

                    ARMAND
          It's already begun. If you want to
          save her, send her away.

                    LOUIS
          Then I leave too.

     Armand smiles.

                    ARMAND
          So soon? Without any of those
          answers you so longed for?

                    LOUIS
          You said there were none.

                    ARMAND
          But you asked the wrong questions.
          Do you know how few vampires have
          the stamina for immortality? How
          quickly they perish of their own
          will.

                    LOUIS
          We can do that?

                    ARMAND
          You would never give up life. If
          the world were reduced to one empty
          cell, on fragile candle, you stay
          alive and study it. You see too
          clearly. You see too much.

                    LOUIS
          That's what the one who made me
          said.

                    ARMAND
          How he must have loved you.

     Armand suddenly grips Louis close to him.

                    ARMAND
          Louis, I need you more than he ever
          did. I need a link with this
          century. The world changes. We do
          not. Therein lies the irony that
          ultimately kills us. I need you to
          make contact with this age.

     Louis laughs bitterly.

                    LOUIS
          He? Don't you see? I'm not the
          spirit of any age! I'm at odds with
          everything and always have been!
          I'm not even sure what I am!

     Armand smiles.

                    ARMAND
          But Louis, that is the very spirit
          of your age. The heart of it. You
          fall from grace has been the fall
          of a century.

     Louis is stunned.

                    LOUIS
          And the vampires of the Theatre?

                    ARMAND
          Like moths around the candle of the
          age. Decadent, useless. They can't
          reflect anything. But you do. You
          reflect its broken heart.

     Louis is speechless.

                    ARMAND
          Are these not the answers you came
          for?

                    LOUIS
               (softly)
          Yes... My God...

                    ARMAND
          A vampire with a human soul. An
          immortal with a mortal's passion.
          You are beautiful, my friend.
          Lestat must have wept when he made
          you -

                    LOUIS
          Lestat! You knew Lestat!

                    ARMAND
          Yes I knew him. Knew him well
          enough not to mourn his passing.

     Armand stands. He takes Louis by the arm, leads him
     towards the back wall.

                    ARMAND
          But you must go now. You must get
          her safely out of Paris.

     He opens a hidden door in the wall.

                    ARMAND
          No-one else knows of this door.
          When you knock you will find me
          waiting...


     EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - NIGHT

     Louis, in the street outside, as the door closes behind
     him.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          I felt a kind of peace at last. I
          had found the teacher which Lestat
          could never, I knew now, have been.
          I knew knowledge would never be
          withheld by Armand. It would pass
          through him as through a pane of
          glass. And I knew Claudia must
          leave me...


     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     Louis enters. There is unfamiliar scent in the air, a
     doll sitting by the mirror. Louis looks in the mirror
     and sees...


     MADELEINE

     The doll-maker, resplendent in green taffeta, sitting
     like a Madonna with Claudia on her lap. Claudia's arms
     are wound round her neck. The contrast between mortal
     woman and immortal child is plain.

                    CLAUDIA
          Madeleine... Louis is shy.

     Madeleine rises and comes towards Louis. She draws back
     the lace fringes round her throat, so he can see the
     two marks there. She says softly, dreamily.

                    MADELEINE
          Drink.

     Louis turns away. Claudia speaks, icy, from the bed.

                    CLAUDIA
          Do it Louis. Because I cannot do
          it. I haven't the strength. You saw
          to that when you made me.

     Louis turns to Madeleine.

                    LOUIS
          You haven't the vaguest conception
          under God of what you ask!

                    MADELEINE
          Au contraire, monsieur, I have.

     Louis pushes her away. Claudia screams.

                    CLAUDIA
          You have found your new companion,
          Louis! You will make me mine!

     Louis grips Madeleine and shakes her.

                    LOUIS
          How do we seem to you? Do you think
          us beautiful, magical, our white
          skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you
          ask me! Have you any idea of the
          thing you will become?

                    CLAUDIA
          Your evil is that you cannot be
          evil! And I will suffer for it no
          longer!

                    LOUIS
          Don't make me, Claudia! I cannot do
          it!

                    CLAUDIA
          Yet you could do it to me!
          Snatching me from my mother's hands
          like two monsters in a fairy-tale!
          Couldn't you have waited? Six more
          years and I would have had that
          shape! And now you weep! You
          haven't tears enough for what
          you've done to me.

     She points to Madeleine

                    CLAUDIA
          You give her to me! Do this before
          you leave me!

     She begins to weep, sobbing like a child.

                    CLAUDIA
          Oh God! I love you still, that's
          the torment of it. But you know I
          must leave you Louis...

                    LOUIS
          Yes...

                    CLAUDIA
          And who will care for me my love,
          my dark angel, when you are gone?

     Louis looks at Madeleine

                    LOUIS
          You promise to care for her then?

                    MADELEINE
          Yes...

                    LOUIS
          And you know what you ask for?

     She wraps her arms around Claudia.

                    MADELEINE
          Yes.

                    LOUIS
          What do you think she is,
          Madeleine? A doll?

                    MADELEINE
          A child who can't die...

     Her finger clutches a locket around her neck, Louis
     touches it, opens it.


     THE LOCKET

     A picture of a young girl, Claudia's age, wistful,
     beautiful.

                    LOUIS
               (softly)
          And the child who did die?

                    MADELEINE
          My daughter...

     Louis takes her chin in his hand, gently.

                    LOUIS
          Look at the gaslight. Don't take
          your eyes off it. You will be
          drained to the point of death, but
          you must stay alive. Do you hear
          me?

                    MADELEINE
          Yes!

     Louis pulls her to him and starts to drink her blood.


     EXT. HOTEL BALCONY - LATER

     Louis on the balcony, weakened terribly. A breeze blows
     on the gauze curtains behind him, through which we
     see...

     SILHOUETTES of Madeleine and Claudia. Madeleine her
     arms outstretched, now a vampire, a long moan of pain
     coming from her. Claudia comes through the curtains,
     alarmed.

                    CLAUDIA
               (whispers)
          Louis!

     Louis speaks without turning.

                    LOUIS
          She is dying. It happened to you
          too, but your child's mind can't
          remember.

                    CLAUDIA
          But if she dies...

                    LOUIS
          It's only mortal death.

     He turns to look at Claudia.

                    LOUIS
          Bear me no ill will, my love. We
          are now even.

                    CLAUDIA
          What do you mean?

                    LOUIS
          What died tonight inside that room
          was not that woman. It will take
          her many nights to die, perhaps
          years. What has died in that room
          tonight is the last vestige in me
          of what was human.

     She takes his hand.

                    CLAUDIA
          Yes father. At last. We are een.

     He bends down and kisses her. He looks up, at the
     wafting curtains. He sees -


     MANY VAMPIRE SHADOWS

     Silhouetted, coming closer.


     CLAUDIA

     Looks up and screams.


     THE CURTAINS

     Are ripped aside. The vampires of the Theatre surge
     through.

                    ESTELLE
          Time for justice, little one.

     The vampires close on them as Louis struggles,
     Claudia's scream pierces the night air.


     INT. CORRIDOR OF THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - NIGHT

     In a press of vampires, Louis, Claudia and Madeleine
     are forced down the dark corridor. Into -


     THE BALLROOM

     Vampire chaos, as they are dragged through. Louis
     struggling like a demon.

                    LOUIS
          Armand! Get me Armand! he wouldn't
          countenance this -

                    SANTIAGO
          You can make no demands here!
          Buffoon! Bastard -

     Santiago strikes Louis to the ground. As he struggles
     to his feet, he sees the vampires part around a figure
     coming through. He gasps at the sight of -


     LESTAT

     Dressed beautifully, but horribly scarred now, from the
     fire as well as the earlier stabbing. Lestat is
     confused, ancient, teetering, reaching for Santiago's
     shoulder to steady himself.

                    LESTAT
          Louis...

                    SANTIAGO
          Is he the one?

     Lestat shakes his head.

                    LESTAT
          No, the child. The child was the
          one...

                    SANTIAGO
          All the murderers!!!

                    LOUIS
          You are alive, Lestat! It can't be
          murder! Tell them how you treated
          us...

     Lestat reaches out to Louis.

                    LESTAT
          No... You come back to me Louis...

                    LOUIS
          Are you mad???

                    ESTELLE
          The sentence is death! To all of
          them!!!

                    LESTAT
          Only the girl - it was the girl -

     The sound of something being dragged through the crowd.
     Horrible echoing, scraping -

     Lestat grips Santiago.

                    LESTAT
          You promised me - I could take him
          back to New Orleans - Louis -
          there's something I must tell you -
          about that night - that night I met
          you -

     He stares around him, confused. The scraping gets
     louder.

                    LOUIS
          You let her go, Lestat - you let
          her free - and I'll come back with
          you -

     Santiago grabs Louis by the neck.

                    SANTIAGO
          Death for the others. For you
          eternity in a box -

     We see now what caused the scraping. A huge metal
     coffin being dragged through the vampires. Claudia
     screams.

                    SANTIAGO
          Walled in a dungeon. Your only
          company will be your screams...
          Perhaps it will take centuries...

     The vampires grab Louis. They force him towards the
     coffin. Lestat struggles with them.

                    LESTAT
          He's coming home with me - you
          promised -

                    SANTIAGO
               (laughing)
          We promised nothing!

     Louis struggles fiercely as he is forced into the
     coffin. Claudia weeps.

                    LOUIS
          They've fooled you, Lestat! You
          must reach Armand! Armand has the
          power!

     Louis, struggling in the coffin. Then the lid is forced
     down, huge locks closed over it.


     INT. COFFIN

     Louis, in the smallest imaginable space. Beating his
     forehead against the metal.


     EXT. COFFIN

     Claudia, throwing herself on the coffin, crying. She is
     dragged away. Vampire hands drag the coffin across the
     stone floor.


     INT. COFFIN

     Louis, forehead pouring with blood, being thrown this
     way and that. The coffin is lifted, upside down, Louis'
     head crashes off the floor.


     EXT. COFFIN

     Is thrust into a niche in the wall. Bricks being placed
     over, mortar trowelled on.


     INT. COFFIN

     Louis upside down. Sounds of bricks and mortar. Then
     terrifying, unearthly scream pierces the coffin,
     striking to his very soul.

                    LOUIS
          Claudia!!!

     He loses consciousness.


     BLACKNESS

     INT. COFFIN

     Louis sleeps, upside down. Sound of bricks being
     broken, thrown aside. Then of locks breaking.

     Louis opens his eyes. The lid opens. He sees -

                    ARMAND
          Above him, reaching down to take
          his hand.

                    ARMAND
          Hurry. Don't make a sound.

     Louis gets out, into a vast long catacomb. Louis runs
     to the end of it, steps through a broken brick wall.

                    LOUIS
          Where is she? Where's Claudia?

                    ARMAND
          Follow me - that way - through my
          cell -

     He points to his cell at the end of the passage, the
     foot of the steps. Sound of rain beyond the door.

                    LOUIS
          Not without Claudia. Where is she?

                    ARMAND
          I can't save her.

                    LOUIS
          You can't believe I'd leave without
          her. Armand! You must save her! You
          have no choice.

                    ARMAND
          Louis, I can't save her. I will
          only risk losing you -

     Louis runs up the stone stairs. It leads to the
     ballroom. He enters.

     Estelle stands far off, looking at him coolly. She
     lifts the stage skull mask and laughs softly behind it.
     A male vampire slumps in a chair staring softly at
     Louis.

     Silence. Indifference.

     Louis sees Lestat sitting in a far corner. he rushes up
     to Lestat, who looks up at him, confused. He's holding
     something crumpled, made of cloth.

                    LESTAT
          You'll come home with me Louis? For
          a little while... until I am myself
          again.

                    LOUIS
          CLAUDIA!!!

     Louis turns round and round in rage. Passive still
     faces. A door bangs open and shut.

     Louis looks again at Lestat. He snatches the cloth from
     Lestat's hand. We see it is a small torn bloodstained
     dress. Claudia's dress.

     The door bangs again. Estelle laughs. Rain gusts into
     the ballroom.

     Louis goes to the door, holding the dress. Armand
     approaches, trying to pull him away, but Louis shrugs
     him off. He draws nearer and nearer and stairs at -


     INT. BRICK AIRWELL

     On the stones lie Claudia and Madeleine, burn to ashes,
     in each other's arms, like the corpses of his wife and
     daughter in the New Orleans graveyard, embracing each
     other.

     Only Claudia's blond hair and Madeleine's red hair
     remain unburnt.

     Louis looks up at the walls of this airwell, many
     stories to the sky. He cries out in agony.

     Santiago appears behind him, staring. Louis roars in
     horror and attacks Santiago, scattering the ashes into
     the rainy wind. Claudia's golden locks fly up into the
     wind, they whirl around the warring figure.

     Armand appears, drags Louis free, pulls him screaming
     from the airwell, into the ballroom, towards the exit.

     Claudia's hair is sucked up by the wind through the
     airwell, towards the night sky.


     EXT. NOTRE DAME DOOR - NIGHT

     Louis is slumped against the stone wall. Armand stands
     beside him like a guardian angel.

                    ARMAND
          I couldn't prevent it.

                    LOUIS
          I don't believe you. I do not have
          to read your soul to know that you
          lie.

                    ARMAND
          Louis, they cannot be brought back.
          There are some things that are
          impossible, even for me.

                    LOUIS
          You let them do it.

     Louis climbs to his feet.

                    LOUIS
          You held sway over them. They
          feared you. You wanted it to
          happen.

                    ARMAND
          Louis, I swear I did not.

                    LOUIS
          I understand you only too well. You
          let them do it, as I let Lestat
          turn a child into a demon. As I let
          her rip Lestat's heart to pieces!
          Well I am no longer that passive
          fool that has spun evil from evil
          till the web traps the one who made
          it. Your melancholy spirit of this
          century! I know what I must do. And
          I warn you - you saved me tonight,
          so I return the favor - do not go
          near your cell in the Theatre Des
          Vampires again.


     EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - DAWN

     Wet and deserted, the streets around the theatre are
     quiet.


     CLOSEUP - CLOCK

     Chiming five a.m.


     CLOSE ON LOUIS

     Looking at the paling sky. He is in an alleyway,
     outside of Armand's cell. He has a huge keg with him.
     he finds the door unlocked. He enters.


     INT. CELL

     Empty. The hearth is cold. The old coffin is gone.
     Louis silently closes the door to the passage and
     blocks it with an immense bar. He goes in the other
     door.


     INT. THEATRE

     Louis hurls kerosene all over the stage, the curtain,
     the sets, the seats below. He grabs the scythe from the
     playlet. He walks out. Dribbling a trail of kerosene
     behind him.


     INT. STAIRS

     Louis walking rapidly down, leaving the trail of
     kerosene. He creeps quietly into the -


     BALLROOM

     Leaking kerosene from the cask. He splashes over the
     coffins that gleam in the dimness.

     Then he strikes a match and heaves it into the
     kerosene. Everything bursts into flame. The trail of
     kerosene roars into fire through the ballroom over the
     coffins and up the stairs. We hear EXPLOSIONS of fire
     from above.


     LOUIS

     Shudders all over, fighting the morning weakness. He
     readies the scythe, like the grim reaper.


     ESTELLE

     Rises from her burning coffin, screams and tries to run
     through the fire but Louis slashes her down with the
     scythe and she goes down screaming, her dress in
     flames.

                    ESTELLE
          Stop him. It's morning. The
          sunlight. Stop him.

     Others rise, choking in the smoke. Screams from
     everywhere. They are burning.

     Louis backs up the stairs to the -


     DUNGEON

     He can see there a thin pale light under Armand's
     bolted door. Suddenly -


     SANTIAGO

     Comes at him from behind. Louis turns. Santiago rushes
     him in a blur. Louis swings the scythe, too fast to see
     what he himself is doing. Santiago's head streaming
     blood flies through the air.

     The body drops, flapping its arms.

     SCREAMS come from everywhere.

     Another vampire rushes burning towards Louis. He
     decapitates him in turn. Then he staggers into Armand's
     cell, and bars the door the connects it to the ballroom
     behind him. He staggers to the outer door. There is a
     thin strip of daylight, beneath the door, blinding him.
     He throws it open, and staggers into the daylight.


     EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - DAWN

     Louis staggers out of the burning theatre, into the
     thin daylight. Great gusts of smoke cover the street.
     He staggers through the daylight, weakening, about to
     fall, when through the clouds of smoke comes -


     A MAGNIFICENT HEARSE

     As in a dream, driven by Armand's human boy. The door
     of the hearse opens. Through the curtains enclosing the
     interior, we see Armand. He reaches a hand out to Louis
     and pulls him inside.

     The hearse vanishes through the smoke, leaving the
     spectacle of the burning theatre.


     EXT. THEATRE DES VAMPIRES - TWILIGHT

     The gutted Theatre and ballroom, the roof collapsed,
     exposed to the evening sky. The life of Paris goes on
     around it, oblivious.


     INT. LOUVRE - NIGHTS LATER

     It is already a museum by this time and Louis and
     Armand, fancily dressed and composed, walk through it.
     They stop by a Gericault - The Wreck of the Medusa.

                    LOUIS
          You didn't even warm them, did you?

                    ARMAND
          No.

                    LOUIS
          And yet you knew what I would do.

                    ARMAND
          I knew. I rescued you, didn't I?
          From the terrible dawn.

                    LOUIS
          You were their leader. They trusted
          you.

                    ARMAND
          You made me see their failings,
          Louis. You made me look at them
          with your eyes.

     He looks at Louis affectionately.

                    ARMAND
          Your melancholy eyes...

                    LOUIS
          What a pair we are. We deserve each
          other, don't we?

                    ARMAND
          We are a pair, and that's what
          counts.

     Armand and Louis walk slowly through the Louvre
     together. Camera follows them for a while, then comes
     to rest on a sunrise by Turner.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          We left Paris shortly after. For
          years we wandered. Greece, Egypt,
          all the ancient lands. Then, out of
          curiosity, perhaps, boredom, who
          knows what, I took him home, to my
          America...


     INT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT

     A deco cinema of the twenties. Louis and Armand,
     dressed in the style of the period walk down the aisle
     through the crowded seats.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          And there, a technological wonder
          allowed me see sunrise, for the
          first time in two hundred years...

     On the screen, Murnau's "Sunrise", in black and white.
     We see a montage of sunrises, from a whole range of
     movies, in black and white.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          And what sunrises! Seen as the
          human eye could never see them. We
          would sit in the dark, night after
          night among nameless humans,
          entranced with the miracle of
          light. Silver at first, then as the
          years progressed in tones of
          purple, red and my long-lost
          blue...

     The SUNRISES continue, in color now, and the
     backgrounds in them change to the fifties.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          And in time parted. We had become
          so alike, we both wanted the
          certainties of loneliness once
          more.

     The lights come up in a different theatre. Louis
     sitting there, alone, in a half empty theatre, dressed
     in the clothes of the fifties. He rises, exits with the
     others.


     EXT. NEW ORLEANS STREET - NIGHT

     Cars rushing by, twentieth-century madness. Louis
     emerges from the theatre, walks through the streets.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          I had returned to new Orleans. As
          soon as I smelt the air, I knew I
          was home. There was sadness there,
          rich, almost sweet, like the
          fragrance of jasmine. I walked the
          streets, savoring it like a long
          lost perfume...


     EXT. GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT

     Louis walks past the many Greek Revival Mansions.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          And then on Prytania Street, only
          blocks from the Lafayette cemetery
          I caught the scent of death and it
          wasn't coming from the graves...

     CAMERA PANS OVER white-walled Lafayette cemetery and
     its surrounding mansions.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          The scent grew stronger as I
          walked. Old death. A scent too
          faint for mortals to detect.

     Louis sees rats darting across the street. They rush
     into a great overgrown garden surrounding a ruined
     mansion. No lights.

     Louis stops at a rusted gate. He forces it open and
     enters -


     A VERITABLE JUNGLE

     Of overgrown rose and oak tree and wisteria. he sees a
     faint glimmer of light coming from a distant glass
     window of a huge Greek Revival house. He approaches
     then he sees -


     OLD SHRIVELLED CORPSE

     Of a man, long dead and dried up, snagged in the thorny
     rosevines.


     LOUIS

     Looks around. Walks on. Sees another corpse, almost
     nothing but bones, sinking into the wet earth, the
     roots of an oak overgrowing it.

     He looks up at the distant light.

     He passes a third corpse, caught in wisteria and rose
     vine, only bones and clothes.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          They were like the doomed princess
          caught in the thorny vines of
          Sleeping Beauty's castle. I knew
          what it meant. A vampire had lured
          them here, but had been to weak to
          get rid of them.

     Louis sees dead rats lying near the steps.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          It spelt weakness, madness, the
          behavior of a dying animal that
          pollutes its own lair.

     Louis treads carefully on the rotted steps. he moves
     along the porch. More dead rats. He sees through the
     floor-length window into rooms lined with stacked
     books. Virtually walled with them. Water seeps down
     from the ceiling, gleaming as it streaks over the
     books. The floors of the splendid rooms are bare,
     except for a rotten French chair by a dead fireplace. A
     single mirror reflecting the moon.

     Dead rats.

     He moves along the porch to the parlor windows. The
     candle flickers inside. He sees -


     HIS POV

     Lestat lying on the floor. He is gaunt to near
     starvation. All his scars are gone, but he is almost a
     skeleton and his eyes are enormous in their sockets.
     His clothes are rags. Blond hair beautiful, as always.


     MALLOY'S ENTRANCES FACE SUPERIMPOSED OVER

                    MALLOY (V.O.)
          Lestat escaped the fire!

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          He hadn't even been there. And all
          those years I thought he was dead.


     BACK TO LESTAT

     One tiny candle stands beside him. He reads an early
     comic, from the turn of the century. Without turning
     his head, he speaks.

                    LESTAT
          I'm so glad you're here Louis...
          I've dreamed of your coming...

                    LOUIS
          Don't try to speak... it's
          alright...

                    LESTAT
          I didn't mean to let them do it...
          that Santiago, he tricked me...

                    LOUIS
          That's all past, Lestat.

                    LESTAT
          Yes. Past... she should never have
          been one of us...

     He turns and looks at Louis. Old, fearful, broken.

                    LESTAT
          Still beautiful Louis. You always
          were the strong one.

                    LOUIS
          Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you
          no harm.

                    LESTAT
          You've come back to me, Louis?
          You've come again to me?

     Louis shakes his head. A series of police sirens go by,
     piercing the night sky. A helicopter goes overhead. Red
     flashes illuminate his face. Lestat shivers, covers his
     ears. He's terrified. Louis touches him, calming him,
     until the lights pass over.

                    LOUIS
          It's only a siren...

                    LESTAT
          I can't bear it Louis! The machines
          out there, that fly and that roar!
          And such lights! They make the
          night brighter than the day!

                    LOUIS
          And they frighten you?

                    LESTAT
          You know I love the dark. But
          there's no dark anymore.

                    LOUIS
          It's false light, Lestat. It can't
          harm you...

                    LESTAT
          If you stayed with me Louis, I
          could venture out... little by
          little... become the old Lestat.

     Louis shivers. He releases him.

                    LOUIS
          I have to go now Lestat...

                    LESTAT
          You remember how I was, Louis.. the
          vampire Lestat...

                    LOUIS
          Yes. I remember...

     Lestat shivers.

                    LESTAT
          I tried to tell you Louis... that
          night in Paris... when I first came
          to you... no-one can refuse the
          dark gift, Louis... not even you.

                    LOUIS
          I tried...

                    LESTAT
          And the more you tried, the more I
          wanted you... a vampire with your
          beautiful, suffering human heart.
          And how you suffered... I need your
          forgiveness, Louis.

                    LOUIS
          You have it...

     Louis walks slowly away from him. Lestat turns back to
     his candle, his magazine.

                    LESTAT
          You'll come back, Louis... take me
          out... little by little... and
          maybe I'll be myself again...

     A bluebottle buzzes by him. His hand shoots out and
     grabs it, squeezes the blood.

                    LOUIS
               (whispering)
          Yes, Lestat...


     ON LOUIS

     As he walks through the decayed house. His eyes are
     expressionless.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
          And my story ends there. But in
          fact it ended a long time ago, with
          Claudia's ashes in that theatre. My
          love died with her. I never really
          changed after that. What became of
          Lestat I have no idea. I go on,
          night after night. I feed on those
          who cross my path. But all my
          passion went with her yellow hair.
          I ma a spirit with preternatural
          flesh. Detached. unchangeable.
          Empty.


     INT. ROOM. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT (PRESENT)

     Malloy, staring at Louis.

                    MALLOY
          No... it can't end like that...

                    LOUIS
          But it has. There is no more to
          tell.

                    MALLOY
          But you talk about passion, about
          longing, about things I'll never
          know in my life! It's still inside
          you, in every syllable you speak!
          And then you tell me it ends like
          that? Just empty?

                    LOUIS
          It's over, I'm telling you...

                    MALLOY
          You need a new passion, Louis, a
          new reason to feel... what a story
          you've told, you don't understand
          yourself.

     Louis looks at the cassettes on the table.

                    LOUIS
          Do what you want with it. Learn
          what you can. Give the story to
          others.

     Malloy rises.

                    MALLOY
          You have another chance, Louis.
          Take me! Give me your gift, your
          power...

     Louis is slowly horrified, then outraged and angry.

                    LOUIS
          Is this what you want? You ask me
          for this after all I've told you?

                    MALLOY
          If I could see what you've seen,
          feel what you've felt I wouldn't
          let it end like this! You need a
          like to the world out there, a
          connection... then it won't end
          like this...

     He stares at Louis.

                    MALLOY
          You need me.

     Louis turns away.

                    LOUIS
          Dear God. I've failed again,
          haven't I?

                    MALLOY
          No...

                    LOUIS
          Don't say anymore. The reels are
          still turning. I have but one
          chance to show you the meaning of
          what I've said.

     He looks at the boy. Then suddenly grabs him, lifts him
     off the floor, bares his terrifying fangs and brings
     them to his throat. Malloy screams, in involuntary
     terror.

                    LOUIS
          You like it? You like being food
          for the immortals? You like dying?
          Is it beautiful? Is it intense?

     Malloy, now terrified, whispers

                    MALLOY
          No... please...

     Louis drops him.

                    LOUIS
          Thank God.

     Malloy, falls on the floor, terrified. When he looks
     up, Louis has vanished.

                    MALLOY
          Louis... Louis...

     He looks up at the tape. It is still turning.

                    MALLOY
          Holy shit...

     He shakes his head. He gets up, and with shaking
     fingers gathers his tapes. He runs out of the room.


     EXT. STREET OUTSIDE - NIGHT

     Malloy running for his car, a convertible. He leaps in
     and screeches off through the night.


     EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

     Malloy whips the car through the tiny streets, in
     sheer, unfocused terror.

                    MALLOY
          Jesus...


     EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - NIGHT

     Malloy driving with streams of traffic over the bridge.
     He breathes deeply, to calm himself. He takes a tape
     from his pocket, and with still shaking hands, sticks
     it in the deck.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
               (tape)
          1791. That's when it happened. I
          was twenty-four. Younger then you
          are now.

     Suddenly a bony hand shoots out from the back seat,
     pulls his neck backwards -


     LESTAT

     Sinks his teeth in his neck.


     MALLOY'S HANDS

     On the wheel, shaking, shuddering, losing their grip.


     MALLOY'S EYES

     Bulging, as the life drains out of him. Lestat sucking
     him like a rat.


     THE WHEEL

     Swinging free of Malloy's dying hands.


     THE CAR

     Veers wildly into oncoming traffic.


     LESTAT

     Drinks regardless.


     A TRUCK

     Coming towards them, about to crush the car.


     LESTAT'S BONY HAND

     Grabs the wheel, jerks it as he drinks.


     THE CAR

     Misses the truck by inches.


     LESTAT

     Throws Malloy to one side, climbs into the front seat.

     The tape is playing.

                    LOUIS (V.O.)
               (tape)
          My invitation was open to anyone.
          Sailors, whores, thieves. But it
          was a vampire that accepted...


     ON LESTAT

     At the wheel, the corpse of Malloy in the passenger
     seat. He smiles. We can see the blood renewing him.

                    LESTAT
          Dear Louis... will I ever forget?


     EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - NIGHT

     Lestat drives on, the car a tiny speck against the
     bridge, the sea, the sky beyond, with the first fingers
     of light spreading through it.

                                              FADE OUT



     THE END
