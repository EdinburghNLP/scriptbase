It hadn't even been a year since a plantation owner named Louis had lost his wife in childbirth.
Both his wife and the infant died, and now he has lost his will to live.
A vampire named Lestat takes a liking to Louis and offers him the chance to become a creature of the night: a vampire.
Louis accepts, and Lestat drains Louis' mortal blood and then replaces it with his own, turning Louis into a vampire.
Louis must learn from Lestat the ways of the vampire.
