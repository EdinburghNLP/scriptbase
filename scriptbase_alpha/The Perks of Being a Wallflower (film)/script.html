                 THE PERKS OF BEING a WALLFLOWER



                            Written by

                          Stephen Chbosky




    Final Draft


<b>    FADE IN:
</b>
<b>1   EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                             1
</b>
    The titles begin over black. We hear the sound of an old
    typewriter. Someone reaching out to us. The bell dings,
    announcing the end of a line, and we see our title...

<b>    THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER
</b>
    Music begins, picture fades up, and we are in the city.
    Downtown Pittsburgh. Looking out of the back window like a
    child in the back of a station wagon.

    We see lights on buildings and everything that makes us
    wonder. We see the bridge. And the river below. And then
    we enter...

    The Tunnel.

    We keep moving backwards, watching the lights. Golden,
    alive, and hypnotic. The music carries us as we float out of
    the tunnel. Onto another bridge. And over the highway.

    We move into the night sky, back through the trees, through a
    window, and into...

<b>2   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                  2
</b>
    It is a neat and tidy little room. Few posters or books.
    CHARLIE is 15. He is innocent, hopeful, awkward, and likable
    to everyone but his classmates. He sits at his desk, writing
    a letter in pencil as he tapes the title song through the
    radio on his cassette boom box.

<b>                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>               Dear Friend, I am writing to you because
               she said you listen and understand and
               didn't try to sleep with that person at
               that party even though you could have.
               Please don't try to figure out who she is
               because then you might figure out who I
               am, and I don't want you to do that. I
               just need to know that people like you
               exist. Like if you met me, you wouldn't
               think I was the weird kid who spent time
               in the hospital. And I wouldn't make you
               nervous.

<b>3   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                            3
</b>
    Charlie anxiously walks through the hallway of his suburban
    split level house.
<b>                                                                       2.
</b>

<b>                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>              I hope it's okay for me to think that.
              You see, I haven't really talked to
              anyone outside of my family all summer.

    Charlie moves to the living room where dad watches a football
    game. Mom reads a page turner and sips her white wine.
    Charlie waits for them to notice him. And waits. And waits.

<b>4   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      4
</b>
    Charlie sits at his desk, continuing his letter in pencil.

<b>                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>              But tomorrow is my first day of high
              school ever, and I really need to turn
              things around this year.
                  (hopeful)
              So, I have a plan.

<b>5   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LAST DAY                      5
</b>
    We see it in Charlie's mind. Slow motion and wondrous. The
    kids clear out their lockers by throwing their old papers in
    the air like a New York confetti parade.

<b>                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>              As I enter the school for the first time,
              I will visualize what it will be like on
              the last day of my senior year.

    Charlie walks down the hall.   Triumphant.   Confident.   Happy.

<b>                        CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>              Unfortunately, I counted, and that's...

<b>                                                       SMASH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>6   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - FIRST DAY                     6
</b>
    Reality. The bell rings, and we see the chaotic maze from
    Charlie's POV. A SENIOR BULLY leads the ritual, making
    dozens of freshmen hop down the hall.

<b>                        SENIOR BULLY
</b>              Hop, freshman toads. Hop!    Move it, boys!

    As seniors grab more victims, Charlie moves to the wall.

<b>                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>              ... 1,385 days from now.

    VARSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS pass, wearing their letter jackets.
<b>                                                                    3.
</b>

<b>                        LINEBACKER
</b>              Man, you got big.

<b>                        NOSE TACKLE
</b>              Worked out all summer.   Rock hard, dude.

    At the front of the pack is BRAD HAYS (17), the quarterback.
    He's good looking, charismatic, and friendly. The big man on
    campus. Nice guy, too.

<b>                        BRAD HAYS
</b>              Would you guys get a room?

    They laugh. Charlie turns to the trophy case to avoid them.
    Trying to make himself as small as possible.

<b>                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>                  (trying to be optimistic)
              Just 1,385 days.

<b>7   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH                  7
</b>
    Charlie moves down the lunch line with his sister. CANDACE
    KELMECKIS is 17 and a beautiful type A, straight A priss.

<b>                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>              In the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister
              Candace and her boyfriend Derek would
              have let me eat lunch with their earth
              club.

<b>                        CANDACE
</b>              Seniors only.
                  (barks to Derek)
              What are you doing with a plastic spork?

    Candace turns to her boyfriend, DEREK, 17. Derek is such a
    pussy, the most masculine thing about him is his pony-tail.

<b>                        DEREK
</b>              I don't want to bring back silverware--

<b>                        CANDACE
</b>              Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer.

    Derek takes the silverware like a beaten dog. Charlie
    watches them move into the intimidating cafeteria.

<b>8   INT. CAFETERIA - LATER                                           8
</b>
    Charlie sits in the corner alone, observing everyone having a
    great time with their friends. He sees a pretty girl with
    blonde hair having the best first day. This is SUSAN, 14.
<b>                                                                   4.
</b>

<b>                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>              When my sister said no, I thought maybe
              my old friend Susan would want to have
              lunch with me.

    Charlie catches her eye and waves, but she looks away.

<b>                        CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>              In middle school, Susan was very fun to
              be around, but now she doesn't like to
              say hi to me anymore.

    Charlie turns his attention to the quarterback, Brad Hays.

<b>                         CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>              And then there's Brad Hays, who's the
              quarterback of our team. Before my
              brother went to play football for Penn
              State, he and Brad played together. So,
              I thought maybe he'd say hi to me. But
              Brad's a senior, and I'm me, so... who am
              I kidding?

    Brad catches Charlie staring at him.   Awkward.

<b>9   INT. SHOP CLASS - DAY                                           9
</b>
    Charlie sits by himself, watching the freshmen boys laugh as
    a senior paints a goatee on his face with a grease pencil.

<b>                        CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>              On the bright side, one senior decided to
              make fun of the teacher instead of the
              freshmen. He even drew on Mr. Callahan's
              legendary goatee with a grease pencil.

    Meet PATRICK (18), full of confidence, mischief, and so over
    high school. He is the class clown, performing a perfect
    imitation of the teacher, Mr. Callahan.

<b>                        PATRICK
</b>              Boys, the prick punch is not a toy. I
              learned that in 'Nam back in '68.
              "Callahan," the sergeant said, "put down
              that prick punch and go kill some gooks."

    The laughter suddenly dies as the real MR. CALLAHAN (57)
    walks up behind the oblivious Patrick.

<b>                        PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>              But you know what happened? That prick
              punch killed my best friend in a Saigon
              whorehouse.
<b>                                                                     5.
</b>

     Patrick suddenly feels Mr. Callahan behind him.   Oops.

<b>                         MR. CALLAHAN
</b>               I heard you were going to be in my class.
               Are you proud being a senior taking
               freshman shop, Patty-Cakes?

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>               My name is Patrick. You call me Patrick
               or you call me nothing.

<b>                         MR. CALLAHAN
</b>               Okay... Nothing.

     The class laughs. Except Charlie.   He watches Patrick take
     the long walk back to his seat.

<b>                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>               I felt really bad for Patrick. He wasn't
               saying the impersonation to be mean or
               anything. He was just trying to make us
               freshmen feel better.

<b>                         MR. CALLAHAN
</b>               Everyone open your safety guides.
               Nothing... why don't you read first?

     Patrick opens the book.

               Oh, wow. This is useful guys. We should
               read on.

     Charlie smiles.   He loves him already.

     The kids pass back paperback copies of To Kill A Mockingbird.
     Charlie opens his Trapper Keeper, takes a pencil out of the
     plastic pouch, and writes... "ENGLISH CLASS... DAY ONE."

<b>                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>               My last class of the day is advanced
               English, and I'm excited to finally start
               learning with the smartest kids in the
               school...

     A SMART ASS FRESHMAN girl with braces smiles at him.

          Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.

The kids around him laugh. Charlie's ears turn red. At the
blackboard, the teacher writes his name... Mr. Anderson. But
you can call him BILL (27). Bill is an idealist.

<b>                    BILL
</b>          Shhh. I'm Mr. Anderson. And thanks to
          Teach for America, I'm going to be your
          teacher for freshman English. This
          semester, we're going to be learning
          Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.
          Genius book. Now, who wants to get out
          of the first pop quiz?

All hands go up.   Except Charlie's.   Bill paces the rows.

<b>                    BILL (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm shocked. Alright. You can skip the
          quiz if you tell me which author invented
          the paperback book. Anyone?

As kids think, Bill confiscates contraband, removes hats.

<b>                    BILL (CONT'D)
</b>          He's British. He also invented the
          serial. In fact, at the end of chapter 3
          of his first novel, he had a man hanging
          off a cliff by his fingernails. Hence,
          the term cliffhanger. Anybody?

<b>                    FRESHMAN GIRL
</b>          Shakespeare.

<b>                    BILL
</b>          That's a great guess, but no, Shakespeare
          didn't write novels. Anybody else?
              (off their silence)
          The author was...

Bill is about to give the answer when he notices Charlie has
already written... Charles Dickens.

<b>                    BILL (CONT'D)
</b>          ... Charles Dickens. However, if you and
          I had gone to a play in Shakespeare's
          time, it would have cost 4 pennies. Can
          you imagine that? We would have put
          those pennies in a metal box, which the
          ushers would lock in the office. And
          that's where we get the term... anyone?

     Charlie writes down Box Office, then looks up to find that
     Bill is staring at him. Waiting for him to raise his hand.

<b>                         BILL
</b>               I'll give you a free "A" on anything but
               the final term paper if you get it right.

     Charlie looks down.   He's not going to answer.

<b>                         BILL (CONT'D)
</b>               Box office.

     The kids groan. They should have known.     Charlie smiles to
     himself. He's going to like this class.

     The bell rings. The students chatter their way out of class.
     The last to leave is Charlie.

<b>                         BILL
</b>               You should learn to participate.

     Charlie stops and turns to find Bill erasing the board.

<b>                         BILL (CONT'D)
</b>               Why didn't you raise your hand?

                   (off Charlie's nod)
               I used to get spaz. I mean, come on,
               spaz?

     Charlie smiles.   Bill takes a moment.   Then...

<b>                         BILL (CONT'D)
</b>               So, I heard you had a tough time last
               year. But they say if you make one friend
               on your first day, you're doing okay.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               Thank you, sir, but if my English teacher
               is the only friend I make today, that
               would be sort of depressing.

<b>                          BILL
</b>               Yeah.   I could see that.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               Don't worry, Mr. Anderson.     I'm okay.

     Bill nods and watches Charlie exit.   He gets swallowed up by
     the hallway as the bell rings.

     Charlie looks through the thick office glass. He sees
     Patrick use his charms on MRS. SMALL, (58) the Principal.

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>                   (to Mrs. Small)

     Out of nowhere, the SENIOR BULLY grabs Charlie's book.

<b>                         SENIOR BULLY
</b>               Hey, Freshman Toad.

     The bully rips the cover. He throws it on the ground as his
     friends laugh and disappear down the hall. Charlie walks up
     and picks up his book.

<b>                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>               Well, I have 1,384 days to go. And just

               even worse than middle school.

</b>               If my parents ask me about it, I probably
               won't tell them the truth because I don't
               want them to worry that I might get bad
               again.

     Charlie tapes his book cover back together. He looks up as
     his dad comes home from a long day. Charlie's mom hugs him.

<b>                         CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>               If my Aunt Helen were still here, I could

               understand how I am both happy and sad,
               and I'm still trying to figure out how
               that could be. I just hope I make a
               friend soon. Love always, Charlie.

<b>                         MOTHER (O.S.)
</b>               Charlie, come on.

     His family is seated around the table.    Candace's boyfriend,
     Derek, is their special guest.

<b>                         DEREK
</b>               Mmmm. This chicken paprikash is
               delicious, Mrs. Kelmeckis.

     Charlie's father rolls his eyes, then reads his sports page.

<b>                         MOTHER
</b>               Thank you, Derek. It's Charlie's
               favorite. He was a little nervous about
               starting high school, so I made it.

<b>                         FATHER
</b>               You feel a little silly being nervous
               now, huh, champ?

<b>                           CHARLIE
</b>               Yes, sir.    I sure do.

     Charlie carries his milk back to the table.   He quickly sits,
     hoping someone will change the subject.

<b>                         FATHER
</b>               I told you. Just give 'em a smile and be

               stand him.

     Charlie moves to the entry hall. He looks through the screen
     door to the porch where Candace kisses Derek's cheek goodbye.
     As Derek walks to his mom's Mercedes, Candace joins Charlie.

     The first notes of The Smiths' "Asleep" begins.     As Morrissey
     sings, Charlie keeps reading. And reading.

     hear the toilet flush for the swirly.

     Friday Night Football in Western, PA. Charlie buys his Coke
     and nachos and wanders to the bleachers. He sits alone,
     trying to blend in by cheering with the rest of students.
     When the Mill Grove Devils recover a fumble, he hears...

     Charlie wants to go up to Patrick so badly. After driving
     himself crazy, sitting up and down twice, he approaches.

          waiting for your friends?

Brad Hays puts on his helmet and rushes onto the field.
Charlie dries his hands on his pants. So nervous. A 5
second silence that feels like a year. Think of something to
say. Anything.

<b>                      PATRICK
</b>          Hey, Sam.

Charlie looks up. Standing there is the prettiest girl he's
ever seen. SAM (17) would make every mother proud and every
father nervous. She is alive, adventurous, and a world class
flirt. Great attitude. Great taste. Great banter.

<b>                    SAM

          more disgusting?

Sam sits down, sandwiching Charlie between her and Patrick.
Charlie tries to remain casual. Hang in there, buddy.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          Well, I finally got hold of Bob.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          Party tonight?

<b>                    SAM
</b>          No. He's still trying to shag that
          waitress from the Olive Garden.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          He's never tossing that salad.

Brad Hays marches the Devils offense down the field. The
kids clap. Sam looks at Charlie, then turns back to Patrick.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          Kelmeckis! No shit! Your sister dates
          Pony Tail Derek, doesn't she?

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          Is that what they call him?

<b>                    SAM
</b>          Awww. Leave Pony Tail Derek alone.    You
          put the "ass" in "class," Patrick.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          I try, Sam. I try.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          It's nice to meet you, Charlie.    I'm Sam.

Sam extends her hand to Charlie. Every nail a different
color. They shake. Then, Sam grabs a nacho. Zoinks!

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          So, what's the plan, Sam? You want to go
          to Mary Elizabeth's house?
<b>                                                                     14.

<b>                         SAM
</b>               Can't. She got caught watering down her
               parent's brandy with iced tea. Let's
               just go to Kings.

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>                   (turns to Charlie)
               Hey... we're going to Kings after the
               game if you want to come.

     Charlie nods just as Brad Hays tosses a touchdown pass.   The
     fans go crazy. Especially Patrick. Charlie smiles.

     The Devils' faithful cheer as Brad Hays and his guys enter!
     The place is packed. Patrick and Sam drink coffee while
     Charlie eats his brownie. They're all excited.

<b>                         SAM
</b>               Do you have a favorite band?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               I think The Smiths are my favorite.

<b>                         SAM
</b>               Are you kidding!? I love The Smiths!
               The best breakup band ever. What's your
               favorite song?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               Asleep. It's from Louder Than Bombs. I
               heard it on Pony Tail Derek's mix tape.

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>               That works on so many levels.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               I could make a copy for you.

<b>                         SAM
</b>               Thanks. What about Eide's?     You love
               Eide's, right?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>                   (never heard of it)
               Yeah. They're great.

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>               Not a band, Charlie.

<b>                         SAM
</b>               It's an old record store downtown.
<b>                                                                     15.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          I used to be popular before Sam got me
          some good music. So, watch out, Charlie.
          She'll ruin your life forever.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          That's okay.

Brad Hays, the quarterback, passes with his posse.       Taunting.

</b>          Let it go!     Jesus!   It's an old joke!
          It's over!

Sam laughs.   She loves watching Patrick get riled up.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          So, Charlie... what are you going to do
          when you get out of here?

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          My Aunt Helen said I should be a writer,
          but I don't know what I'd write about.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          You could write about us.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          Yeah. Call it Slut and The Falcon.      Make
          us solve crimes.

Sam laughs.   Charlie smiles.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          You guys look happy together. How long
          have you been boyfriend and girlfriend?
              (off their laughs)
          What?

<b>                    SAM
</b>          He's my step-brother. My mom finally
          left my worthless dad and married his
          nice dad 3 years ago.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          But Sam's not bitter.     Make no mistake.

<b>                     SAM
</b>          Absolutely. I'm not a bulimic.      I'm a
          bulim-ist.
<b>                                                                      16.

     They laugh at their inside joke.    Charlie has no idea what's
     so funny.

<b>                            CHARLIE
</b>               I'm sorry.     I don't know what that means.

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>               She just really believes in bulimia.

<b>                         SAM
</b>                   (cracking up)
               I love bulimia.

     Charlie hops out of Sam's old truck.    The music blares.

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>               Thanks for paying, Charlie.

<b>                         CHARLIE

<b>                         SAM
</b>                   (distracted - to Patrick)
               God, would you turn that down? You're
               going to make us deaf. Bye, Charlie.

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>               Bye, Charlie.

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>               Okay.   Bye.

     Charlie waves as the truck leaves. The look on his face.
     The happiness from one night of company.

     Charlie enters the house, excited to tell someone his news.
     He runs up the stairs to find the living room empty. He
     hears the TV playing downstairs in the basement.

     As Charlie approaches, he hears muffled sounds of fighting.

<b>                         DEREK (O.S.)
</b>               I'm sorry. I can't do anything about it.

               Then, I could spend a Saturday with you.

     Charlie looks through a slit in the open door to find...

<b>                         DEREK
</b>               There's nothing I can do--

<b>                         CANDACE
</b>               Do you always want to be a mama's boy?

</b>               -- your mom says, "Don't go to Columbia

               needs you to stay at home because she
               can't drive herself." She's only 51.

     Charlie enters, wanting to stop the fight. Derek's neck is
     red. Dangerous angry. Candace keeps digging.

<b>                          CANDACE
</b>               And you just stand there like a little
               bitch dog.

     SNAP! Out of nowhere, Derek slaps her across the face. It's
     not a movie slap. It's a real slap. Dead sound. And after
     it, silence. Candace turns and sees Charlie. It sobers her
     up. Charlie moves at Derek. Candace stops him.

<b>                         CANDACE (CONT'D)
</b>               Charlie, just go. I can handle it.   Just
               don't wake up mom and dad.

     She pushes him out of the room and closes the door.

     Charlie sits at his desk. So disturbed. He hears a car
     start outside. He moves to his window and looks down at
     Derek and Candace near Derek's mother's Mercedes. Derek is
     crying. Candace comforts. After a beat... they kiss.

     Charlie stands frozen, a look creeping across his face.

     The door opens to reveal Charlie's mom and AUNT HELEN
     entering the house. Aunt Helen carries a suitcase. The
     children don't know where she's been or why she looks sad.
     They just know they love her. Little Charlie stands at the
     top of the stairs with his brother and sister in their Sunday
     clothes. There are balloons. And streamers.

<b>                         LITTLE CANDACE

<b>                          AUNT HELEN

     Charlie stands at the top of the stairs as Candace enters the
     house. She is startled when she sees Charlie. They whisper.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               What are you doing?

<b>                         CANDACE

               never hit me before. I promise he'll
               never hit me again.

     She's about to go back downstairs when...

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?

     A silence passes between them.   Then...

               can handle him. Will you trust me?
               Please, don't tell mom and dad.

     With a desperately confident nod, Candace goes downstairs.
     Charlie stands in the entry hall, troubled.

     The Homecoming Dance is in full swing. God bless everyone.
     Especially Charlie. He's alone at the wall, dressed in his
     Sunday suit. To us, adorable. To himself, in living hell.

     Charlie watches his sister, slow dancing with Derek. As
     happy as she looks, Charlie still isn't sure if he did the
     right thing by keeping quiet. The song ends to applause.

     After a beat, Charlie turns away. That's when he sees Sam
     and Patrick at the punch bowl. We hear the first notes of
     "Come On, Eileen" by Dexy's Midnight Runners.

<b>                         SAM
</b>               Oh, my God. They're playing good music.

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>               Holy shit. They are!   They're playing
               good music!

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>               Living room routine!

     Charlie watches Sam and Patrick run to the center of the
     floor and show this stiff crowd what dancing is. It starts
     slow. "So over it" hand moves. A little shoulder. And
     then, the best of swing. 30 seconds of genius.

     Charlie takes a breath. Then, he tries desperately not to
     look like he's dancing toward them as he dances toward them.
     He bobs his head like a dork. And once he gets close,
     Patrick and Sam turn and find him.

<b>                         SAM &amp; PATRICK
</b>               Hey!

     Without a pause, they grab his hands, and move together in a
     circle. Their own island. After a moment, Sam moves around
     Charlie like a maypole as the whole gym explodes into dance.

</b>               But you wore that toasty costume. It's

</b>               Piss off, Tennessee Tuxedo.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               Are you sure it's okay that I come?

<b>                         SAM
</b>               Of course. Just remember, Charlie...
               Bob's not paranoid.

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>               "He's sensitive."

     Sam knocks. The door opens, revealing BOB (20). Bob was the
     cool high school kid, who never quite left. He's stoned so
     often that people can't tell the difference anymore.

</b>               Only if I have Patrick's blessing.

<b>                          BOB

</b>          You ready to meet some desperate women?

MARY ELIZABETH and ALICE (both 17) sit on the sofa together.
Mary Elizabeth is smart, a little overweight, and extremely
bossy. Alice will figure out that she's a lesbian in
college. Right now, she just likes movies and is Mary
Elizabeth's "beta female."

</b>          This is Charlie's first party ever. So,

</b>          Patrick, you're such a dick.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          Where the hell did you go?

<b>                    MARY ELIZABETH
</b>          The dance was a little boring, don't you
          think?

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          You're so selfish. We looked everywhere
          for you. You could have told someone.

</b>               I think you're doing something wrong.

<b>                         MARY ELIZABETH
</b>               Or something very right.

     Patrick and Mary Elizabeth laugh at their banter, just as Sam
     calls out from the other side of the room.

<b>                           SAM (O.S.)
</b>               Hey!    Look who's here!

     The party turns, and Charlie sees Brad Hays, the quarterback,
     enter with Sam and Bob. Patrick approaches them. Charlie
     sits on the beat up couch next to the girls. He's shocked.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               Is that Brad Hays?

<b>                           ALICE
</b>               Yeah.    He comes here sometimes.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               But he's a popular kid.

<b>                         MARY ELIZABETH
</b>                   (offended)
               Then, what are we?

     Charlie tries to think of something, but he can't.    The girls
     turn, ignoring him. Bob approaches with a tray.

<b>                         BOB
</b>               Charlie, you look like you could use a
               brownie.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               Thank you. I was so hungry at the dance.
               I was going to go to King's, but I didn't
               really have any time. Thanks.

     Bob smiles. Mary Elizabeth gives Alice a knowing glance.
     Charlie bites into the brownie. The icing gushing between
     his teeth. The image goes up into the smoke like an inhale
     as he chews and chews and chews.

whole party surrounds him now, pissing themselves with
laughter as this shy kid talks and talks and talks.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          Have you guys felt this carpet?     This
          carpet feels so darn good.

<b>                    MARY ELIZABETH
</b>              (laughing)
          Charlie, what do you think about high
          school?

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          High school? Bullshit. The cafeteria is
          called the Nutrition Center. And people
          wear their letter jackets even when it's
          98 degrees out. And why do they give out
          letters for marching band? That's not a
          sport, and we all know it.

<b>                    MARY ELIZABETH
</b>          This kid is crazy.

Charlie looks at Mary Elizabeth with her new wave haircut.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          And Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really
          going to regret that haircut when you
          look back at old photographs.
              (off their laughter)
          I'm really sorry. That sounded like a
          compliment in my head.

<b>                    MARY ELIZABETH
</b>          Oh, my God!

<b>                    ALICE
</b>          Well, it's kind of true.

<b>                       MARY ELIZABETH
</b>          Shut up!

Sam enters the room.    Takes quick stock.   Then...

<b>                    SAM
</b>          Bob, did you get him stoned?

<b>                    BOB
</b>          Come on, Sam. He likes it.     Just look at
          him.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          How do you feel, Charlie?
<b>                                                                     24.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               I just really want a milkshake.

     The entire room explodes with laughter.    Charlie loves that
     people find him so funny.

     Sam takes the ice cream from the freezer to the blender.
     Charlie watches her make the perfect vanilla milkshake.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               Sam, you have such pretty brown eyes, the
               kind of pretty that deserves to make a
               big deal about itself. You know what I
               mean?

<b>                         SAM
</b>               Okay, Charlie.     Let me make the milkshake.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               What a great word. Milkshake. It's like
               when you say your name over and over
               again in the mirror, and after awhile, it
               sounds crazy.

<b>                         SAM
</b>               I'm guessing you've never been high
               before?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               Me? No. My best friend Michael. His
               dad was a big drinker. So, he hated all
               that stuff. Parties, too.

<b>                         SAM
</b>               Well, where is Michael tonight?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               Oh, he shot himself last May.

     Sam looks up.   Shocked silent.   Charlie is just stoned.

<b>                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>               I kind of wish he'd left a note.    You
               know what I mean?
                   (off her sad nod)
               Where's the bathroom?

<b>                         SAM
</b>               It's up the stairs.

     Charlie wanders off.    Sam watches him go.

     Charlie leaves the bathroom and stops when he sees himself in
     a large ornate mirror in the hallway.

<b>                            CHARLIE
</b>               Charlie.     Charlie.   Weird.

     Charlie wanders down the hallway, a little lost. He finds
     the door to the master bedroom and opens it. He sees Patrick
     and Brad Hays... kissing.

<b>                            CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>               Woah.

<b>                            PATRICK
</b>               Charlie?

               Who is that kid?

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>               Relax. Relax. He's a friend of mine.
               Stay here.

     Patrick closes the bedroom door and follows Charlie.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               I didn't see anything.

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>               I know you saw something, but it's okay.

     Patrick takes a quick peek to make sure no one is watching.

<b>                         PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>               Listen, Brad doesn't want anyone to
               know... wait, are you baked?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               "Like a cake." That's what Bob said.
               And how you can't have 3 on a match
               because they would find us. And everyone
               laughed, but I don't know what's funny.

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>               Okay, Charlie, listen. I need you to
               promise that you're not going to say
               anything to anyone about me and Brad.

</b>               Thank you.     We'll talk later.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               I look forward to that big talk.

     Patrick laughs, goes back to the room, and closes the door.

     The party has thinned. Sam watches Charlie drink his
     milkshake obsessively with Alice and Mary Elizabeth.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               Isn't this the best milkshake, Alice?
               It's even better than the first one.

     Patrick walks downstairs.    Sam motions him over.

<b>                         SAM
</b>                   (barely audible whisper)
               I need to talk to you. Charlie just told
               me that his best friend shot himself. I
               don't think he has any friends.

     Patrick turns to look at Charlie. He feels so bad for the
     kid. Patrick raises his plastic cup to the remaining crowd.

<b>                            PATRICK
</b>               Everyone.     Raise your glasses to Charlie.

     Charlie looks up.   A little paranoid.     Everyone is staring.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               What did I do?

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>               You didn't do anything. We just want to
               toast our new friend.
                   (off his look)
               You see things. And you understand.
               You're a wallflower.

     Charlie dries his sweaty hands on his pants.     He looks around
     the room at the nods and friendly faces.

<b>                         SAM &amp; EVERYONE
</b>               To Charlie.

     They all drink.    Sam approaches him.    A knowing smile.

<b>                         SAM
</b>               Welcome to the island of misfit toys.

     Charlie smiles, and the soundtrack comes rushing up loud.

     The truck speeds on Highway 376 toward the Fort Pitt Tunnel.
     Patrick drives. Sam cranks the radio, blaring "The Tunnel
     Song." The Star's anthem, "Your Ex-Lover is Dead" is our
     prototype for tone.

     Sam climbs through the window to the flat bed.   She grips the
     flood lights to steady herself as she stands.

<b>                            CHARLIE

</b>                  You got it, your highness.

     Patrick turns up the volume and drums on the steering wheel,
     just as the truck flies into...

<b>     THE TUNNEL
</b>
     We go behind the truck. Rising as Sam puts her arms in the
     air. The image moves to Charlie's point of view, rising from
     Sam's feet up her shivering legs. Past the band-aid on her
     right knee. To Sam's face as she looks down. Into the
     camera. Right at us. For we are now...

     Charlie, looking up at Sam, so in love with this free-spirit.
     So happy to have friends. Happy to be alive. Charlie gets
     this look on his face. Patrick notices and smiles.

     Patrick and Charlie laugh as Sam raises her arms. Free and
     young and alive on the greatest night of Charlie's life.

               impressive. He and his wife might go
               back there after this year. I know this
               is selfish, but I really hope he doesn't.

     Charlie pauses in the doorway and turns back to look at Bill.

     Charlie turns from the lunch line with The Great Gatsby on
     his tray. He looks at the gang at their table. He sits with
     them as they debate the design of this month's fanzine.

</b>               My favorite time, though, is lunch because
               I get to see Sam and Patrick. We spend
               the time working on Mary Elizabeth's
               fanzine about music and The Rocky Horror
               Picture Show. It's called Punk Rocky.
               Mary Elizabeth is really interesting
               because she is a Buddhist and a punk, but
               somehow she always acts like my father at
               the end of a "long day."

</b>               Her best friend Alice loves vampires and
               wants to go to film school. She also
               steals jeans from the mall. I don't know
               why because her family is rich, but I'm
               trying not to be judgemental. Especially
               since I know how they were all there for
               Patrick last year. Patrick never likes
               to be serious, so it took me awhile to
               get what happened.

     Sam and Alice laugh when Patrick begins stapling Mary
     Elizabeth's fanzines to within an inch of their life.

     [Note: The following sequence will come from Charlie's POV of
     Patrick and Brad's activities over a weekend.]

     Brad Hays leads the football team through the banner onto the

     Brad pulls his helmet on and rushes onto the field.

</b>               When he was a junior, Patrick started
               seeing Brad on the weekends in secret. I
               guess it was hard, too, because Brad had
               to get drunk every time they fooled
               around.

               "Man, I was so wasted. I don't remember
               a thing." This went on for 7 months.

     We see Patrick and Brad walking in the library. They reach
     the stacks, and just when it looks like they'll speak, they
     simply... PASS EACH OTHER WITHOUT A WORD.

</b>               Patrick was eventually able to help Brad
               get sober. I asked Patrick if he felt
               sad that he had to keep it a secret, and
               he said no because at least now, Brad
               doesn't have to get drunk to love him.

     Brad sits down with his football pals. Patrick joins Charlie
     and Sam at their table. Charlie looks over at Sam, studying
     hard for her SAT's.

</b>               I think that I understand because I
               really like Sam. I asked my sister about
               her, and she said that when Sam was a
               freshman, the upper classmen used to get
               her drunk at parties. I guess she had a
               reputation. But I don't care. I'd hate
               for her to judge me based on what I used
               to be like.

     The movie is in full swing. Charlie watches Sam as Janet in
     the Floor Show. Sam mimics Susan Sarandon perfectly.
     Especially the body. She winks at Charlie as "Fanfare/Don't
     Dream It" begins and arriving regally as Frank 'n Furter in
     full drag is... Patrick.

</b>               Whatever happened to Fae Wray? That
               delicate, satin draped frame? As it clung
               to her thigh, how I started to cry 'cause
               I wanted to be dressed just the same.

     Patrick is a rock star. He approaches Charlie. Putting his
     ass in his face. Charlie is freaked out and laughing!
     Especially when he sees Brad, alone in the back, smiling.

<b>                         PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>               Give yourself over to absolute pleasure.
               Swim the warm waters of sins of the
               flesh. Erotic nightmares beyond any
               measure. And sensual daydreams to
               treasure forever. Can't you just see it?
               Woah oh oh!

     Charlie stops laughing when the orgy begins between Patrick,
     Mary Elizabeth (as Columbia), CRAIG (21), an art student with
     a model's body (as Rocky)... and of course... Sam. Charlie
     watches Sam until he can't take his lust (or guilt).

     of Craig's loft. Very arty. Very black &amp; white. Charlie's

               all about that night in the tunnel. I

     The tape revolves in the stereo, playing a beautiful ballad.

</b>               Hey, dad.    Can I have 30 dollars?

<b>                          FATHER
</b>                    (old joke)
               20 dollars? What do you want 10 dollars
               for?

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               Sam is doing secret santa. It's her
               favorite thing in the world. Please.

     Charlie's father reaches into his pocket and hands Charlie a
     bill. It's a fifty. Dad winks, in a great mood.

<b>                           FATHER
</b>               Have fun.

<b>                           CHARLIE
</b>               Thanks.

     Lockers are opened by Charlie. Sam. Patrick. Wrapped gifts
     are deposited. Mischief smiles. Lockers closed. Everyone
     loves getting their presents except Charlie - who got socks.

     Bill hands Charlie a well worn copy of The Catcher in the
     Rye. He smiles.

<b>                         BILL
</b>               Charlie... this was my favorite book
               growing up. This is my copy, but I want
               you to have it.

<b>                           CHARLIE

</b>               Have a great Christmas break.

     Mr. Callahan, the shop teacher, looks at a Sad Sack Girl's
     clock. He takes a moment, and then...

<b>                         MR. CALLAHAN
</b>               Terrible stain.
<b>                                                                     38.

     He moves to Charlie's dad's amazing clock.   He hands Charlie
     an A on a piece of paper.

<b>                         MR. CALLAHAN (CONT'D)
</b>               That's pretty good, Charlie.

     Mr. Callahan moves to Patrick's SHITTY WOODEN CLOCK. No
     stain. No finish. Lop-sided. The ugliest clock you've ever
     seen in your life.

<b>                         MR. CALLAHAN (CONT'D)
</b>               You've got to be kidding me.

<b>                         PATRICK
</b>               If you fail me, you get me next semester.

     Mr. Callahan writes a grade and slaps it down.

     The song continues as Patrick holds up the grade. C minus!
     Charlie and Sam cheer as Patrick screams at the top of his

     They pass Mary Elizabeth as she opens her final present.

</b>

<b>                    MARY ELIZABETH
</b>          Multiple pairs of blue jeans. Wow. This
          is a really tough one, but I'm going to
          have to guess... Alice.

Alice smiles. Bob nudges her. Guilty as charged.       Mary
Elizabeth pulls one last item out of the gift bag.

<b>                    MARY ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
</b>          Wait, guys... a receipt! She actually
          paid!

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          Impossible!

<b>                    MARY ELIZABETH
</b>          I'm so touched.

Alice laughs. Patrick pours everyone brandy.    The kids look
ridiculous, but they don't feel ridiculous.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          Where's Craig?

<b>                    SAM
</b>          He went home to Connecticut.    He'll be
          back for New Year's Eve.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          I'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.

Sam nods, then turns. Charlie is delighted. No Craig.         The
kids settle in the living room in front of the fire.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          Alright, big brother by 3 weeks.    Who's
          your secret santa?

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          I'll tell you, Sam. This one's tough. I
          have received a harmonica, a magnetic
          poetry set, a book about Harvey Milk, and
          a mix with the song "Asleep" on it...
          twice.

Charlie starts snickering.    He can't help himself.

<b>                    PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>          I mean, I have no idea. This collection
          of presents is so gay that I think I must
          have given them to myself. But despite
          that distinct possibility, I'm going to
          have to go with... drum roll... Charlie.
<b>                                                           40.

Charlie holds up his hands.     Yay!   They all cheer.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          Alright, Charlie... it's your turn.

Charlie and Patrick switch places.       Charlie stands.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          Okay. Uh, I have received socks, pants,
          a shirt, and a belt. I was ordered to
          wear them all tonight. So, I'm guessing
          my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth.

<b>                     PATRICK
</b>          Huh.   Now, why do you say that?

<b>                     CHARLIE
</b>          I don't know. She bosses people around
          sometimes.

The gang cracks up.   Mary Elizabeth is pissed.

<b>                    MARY ELIZABETH
</b>          What the hell is wrong with you?

<b>                      CHARLIE
</b>          Sorry.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          Well, you'll be surprised to know that
          your secret santa is actually... me.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          You got me clothes?     Why?

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          Because all the great writers used to
          wear great suits. Your last present is
          on a towel rack in the bathroom. Delve
          into our facilities. Emerge a star.

Charlie gives Sam a sack of presents.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          Can you hand these out while I'm gone?

<b>                    MARY ELIZABETH
</b>          Wait a second. There's only secret santa
          presents. There are rules, Charlie.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          Mary Elizabeth, why are you trying to eat
          Christmas? Hand them out, Sam.
<b>                                                                     41.
</b>

     Sam gives out the presents. The group rips them open. Alice
     looks at a book about Martin Scorsese with the inscription...

<b>                         ALICE
</b>               "Alice, I know you'll get into NYU."

     Alice turns to Mary Elizabeth who holds up a card with...

<b>                         MARY ELIZABETH
</b>               40 dollars.
                   (reads card)
               "To print Punk Rocky in color next time."

     Bob blows soap bubbles into the air.   Stoned.   Mesmerized.

<b>                         BOB
</b>               He knows me. He really knows me.

     Sam looks at her present. An old 45 record of The Beatles
     classic "Something" with a card. She reads the card. Holds
     it to her chest. Very moved.

<b>                         SAM
</b>               Come on out, Charlie.

     They all chime in. "Let's go, young man!" "Charlie!
     Charlie!" Charlie opens the door off camera, and we see his
     entrance play off their faces. The reverse angle reveals...

     Charlie dressed in his suit. Like the best of English mods
     in the 60's. For those of you who know the book, this is the
     cover. They all clap. It's magic.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>               Yeah!   What a display of man I have ever
               seen!

     Sam and Charlie look at each and smile.

     The door opens.   Sam and Charlie walk into the dark room.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               Where are we going?

<b>                         SAM
</b>               It's a surprise.

     Sam flips the switch, bathing the room in light. Sam's room
     is so cool. A shrine to music. A xerox that says "The
     Beatings Will Continue Until Morale Improves." Virgin Mary
     icons. Snow globes. Kitsch.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          Is this your room?    It's so cool.

<b>                      SAM
</b>          Thanks.

Sam points to a green box with a red ribbon on her desk.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          You got me a present?

<b>                    SAM
</b>          With all that help on my Penn State
          application? Of course I did. Open it.

Charlie lifts up the box to reveal an OLD MANUAL TYPEWRITER.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          I don't know what to say.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          You don't have to say anything.

Sam goes over and types. "Write about us sometime." He
smiles and types back. "I will." They look at each other.
We can hear a lovely ballad playing downstairs.

<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm sorry we can't be here for your
          birthday.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          That's okay. I'm just sorry you have to
          go back and visit your dad.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          I'm in such a great mood, I don't think
          even he could ruin it. I feel like I'm
          finally doing good.

<b>                      CHARLIE
</b>          You are.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          Me? What about you? When I met you, you
          were this scared freshman. And look at
          you in that suit. You're like a sexy
          English school boy. I saw Mary Elizabeth
          checking you out.

<b>                      CHARLIE
</b>                (innocent laugh)
          No.
<b>                                                               43.
</b>

<b>                    SAM
</b>          Innocent. Worst kind of guys. Never see
          you coming. And parents love you. That's
          like... extra danger.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          Well, it hasn't worked so far.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          Come on. You've never had a girlfriend?
          Not even a 2nd grade valentine?

He shakes his head.

<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)
</b>          Have you ever kissed a girl?

<b>                     CHARLIE
</b>          No.   What about you?

<b>                    SAM
</b>          Have I ever kissed a girl?

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>              (laughs)
          No! Your first kiss...

Sam gets this strange look in her eyes.    A little haunted.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          My first kiss? I was 11. His name was
          Robert. He would come over to the house
          all the time.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          Was he your first boyfriend?

<b>                    SAM
</b>          He was my dad's boss.

Charlie goes silent.

<b>                    SAM (CONT'D)
</b>          You know Charlie, I used to sleep with
          guys who treated me like shit. And get
          wasted all the time. But now... I feel
          like I have a chance. I could even get
          into a real college.

<b>                       CHARLIE
</b>          It's true.     You can do it.

<b>                       SAM
</b><b>                                                                   44.
</b>

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               My Aunt... she had that same thing done
               to her, too. And she turned her life
               around.

<b>                         SAM
</b>               She must have been great.

<b>                         CHARLIE
</b>               She was my favorite person in the
               world... until now.

     Sam smiles.   She's very moved.

<b>                         SAM
</b>               Charlie, I know that you know I like
               Craig. But I want to forget that for a
               minute. Okay? I just want to make sure
               that the first person who kisses you
               loves you. Okay?

     Charlie nods. And with that, Sam leans over and kisses him.
     It starts softly, then Sam wraps her thin arms around him.
     Holding on for lonely life. When the song crescendos, and
     they part, Charlie and Sam look at each other. Finally...

<b>                         SAM (CONT'D)

               get a lot of birthday presents. So, I

     He moves out of the way, and standing there is Charlie's
     older brother, CHRIS KELMECKIS (19). Chris is handsome,
     charismatic, and an all around winner.

     The wind blows out a candle in one of the luminaria bags.
     The suburb is quiet. Not a creature is stirring. Except...

     Charlie. He fills a brown paper bag with    sand and a candle.
     He lights the candle, making the bag glow   like a beautiful
     lantern. He looks down his street, where    families are out
     with their kids, doing the same luminaria   ritual.

     take the sacrament. Charlie is next. The PRIEST makes the

     in front for his own curtain call. Everyone cheers. It's
     the night he'll never forget.

     The wind whips. That bracing February cold. Charlie helps
     Mary Elizabeth carry the costumes outside to her car.

</b>               Maybe I could join the cast as an
               alternate or something?

</b>               We're filled up now, but they'll need
               people after we leave for college. I
               could put in a good word for you.

</b>               That'd be great. Thanks.

     They put the box in her trunk. Snap it closed. We can't

     sticker as Mary Elizabeth tries her best to flirt.

</b>                Yeah. Well, obviously, it's completely
                stupid and sexist. It's like, "Hey,
                thanks for the crumb." And normally, I'd
                just blow it off because school dances
                suck torture. But, you know, it's my
                last year, and... would you maybe want to
                go with me?

     Charlie and Mary Elizabeth slow dance to an 80's love song.
     Sweaty palms. Awkward. Hands on hips. Horror.

     Charlie looks around the gym. He sees Alice dancing with her
     date, an EFFEMINATE GOTH KID (17). We'll never meet him, but
     he'll make us laugh once.

     Charlie then watches Patrick dance with Sam. He follows
     Patrick's gaze across the floor to Brad, who dances with a
     SENIOR GIRL (18). Charlie sees the boys look at each other.
     For one moment, it's like they're dancing together.

</b>               Don't worry. You're doing fine.

     Charlie joins her at the wall.   Mary Elizabeth gives them a
     quick, jealous look.

      Mary Elizabeth approaches Charlie on the antique sofa. She
      uncorks a bottle of wine. POP! She hands him the bottle.

<b>                           MARY ELIZABETH
</b>                Mmmm.   Now, let it breathe.

      Mary Elizabeth walks over to the vintage turntable. She
      turns on the gas fireplace with a remote control. Roar!

      Mary Elizabeth drops the needle on a vinyl LP. A Doo Wop
      make-out classic begins to play. She dances over to Charlie.

                I'd love to expose you to great things.
                Like Billie Holiday and foreign films.

      She pours the wine.   Charlie looks at the bottle.

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>                This merlot is really fancy.

<b>                          MARY ELIZABETH
</b>                Yeah. My dad collects wine, but he
                doesn't drink. That's weird, isn't it?

<b>                            CHARLIE

      around. Heart beating.

      She slowly moves his hand to her dress strap. It falls off
      her shoulder. She leans in for a red wine kiss. She guides
      his hand over her bra. He feels her breast. Wow.

                you have to break up with her.

</b>                I can do that?

      Charlie's father leans back from the sofa and his newspaper.

      He returns.   Mary Elizabeth is still talking on the cordless.

<b>                          MARY ELIZABETH (V.O.)
</b>                I'll give you this book. It's really how
                I became a vegan--

                scare me.

      He looks back at the clock.   3:23pm.

<b>                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)

She kisses him. Charlie bites his cheeks.    Sam looks a
little depressed.

kiss on Alice when she jumps him. Everyone groans. Ew!
Laughter. Patrick looks for the next person. Charlie's
heart pounds. Don't pick me! Please!

                one of us is dying of cancer, so I don't
                have to break up with her.

<b>                           PATRICK
</b>                Charlie?   Truth or dare?

      Charlie blinks.   It was all fantasy.

<b>                           CHARLIE
</b>                Dare.

                because let's face it... I'd smoke all
                you bitches.

      Alice hits him. Laughter. Charlie thinks. He looks at Mary
      Elizabeth, then turns to Sam. Before Sam can even react...
      Charlie plants a kiss right on her lips. When he opens his
      eyes, he looks around, and realizes the magnitude of his
      mistake. Everyone stares. After a horrible silence...

<b>                          PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>                Now that's fucked up.

      Without a word, Mary Elizabeth just stands, dignified, and
      goes into the kitchen.

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>                Mary Elizabeth, I'm sorry.     I'm--

      Alice follows Mary Elizabeth.    Sam is close behind.

<b>                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>                Sam?! Sam! I'm sorry. I didn't mean
                anything by it. I'm sorry.

      Sam turns and looks at him.    She doesn't even recognize him.

<b>                          SAM
</b>                What the hell is wrong with you?

      Charlie is devastated.

                 Other guys. Things that have nothing to
                 do with you. But... it's best if you

      Silence. Charlie looks over at Patrick, who wears a grave
      expression. It's going to be a long time. We hear the sound
      of the typewriter.

</b>          Where? In Schenley Park? Do they know
          about Schenley Park?
              (to Brad's friends)
          Do you guys know about Schenley Park?

Brad stands and gets right in Patrick's face.

<b>                    BRAD HAYS
</b>          I don't know what kind of sick shit

<b>                      PATRICK
</b>           Fine.   Say hi to your dad for me.

Patrick turns and leaves.    And then, as an afterthought...

<b>                     BRAD HAYS
</b>           Whatever... faggot.

Brad's friends laugh.    Patrick stops and turns.   Last chance.

<b>                     PATRICK
</b>           What did you call me?

<b>                     BRAD HAYS
</b>           I called you a faggo--

Smack.

Before Brad can even finish, Patrick throws a vicious right
to the cheek. Brad tackles him. And the two start fighting.
The cafeteria erupts in NOISE.

<b>                     PATRICK
</b>           Say that shit again!    Say that shit
           again!

Brad's football buddies rise and peel Patrick off Brad.     Mary
Elizabeth and Sam jump up from their corner table.

<b>                     MARY ELIZABETH
</b>           It's Patrick!

The cafeteria gets louder. The Nose Tackle holds Patrick up.
More Noise. The Linebacker hits Patrick in the face.

<b>                       SAM
</b>           No!   No!

Sam rushes up and the Nose Tackle pushes her down. She lands
on her tail bone. Thud. Patrick gets hit a couple of times
in the face. The kids cheer the fight. It's getting louder
and louder with more and more noise. And then...

Silence.

Charlie comes out from a blink. He calmly looks around. For
a moment, he doesn't understand where he is. He looks up.
All the kids are staring at him. Mary Elizabeth. Alice.
Brad. They are all quiet. Afraid of him. Charlie looks at
his hand, clenched in a fist. It is already covered with...

</b>

      Charlie's confused until he sees the Linebacker holding his
      broken, bloody nose. He's looking at Charlie...

      Terrified.

      The image pans over. The Nose Tackle is on the ground.
      Charlie stands over them. He is disconnected. It's an out
      of body experience. He reaches out and helps Patrick to his
      feet. Then, he calmly turns and stares right through Brad.

      Brad is stunned.     So is everyone... except Sam.

      Charlie sits in the waiting room of the principal's office.
      He looks through the glass where Principal Small talks to
      Brad. After a beat, she pats Brad's shoulder and opens the
      door. Leaving Charlie and Brad alone in the waiting room.
      Just as Brad is about to leave...

      Charlie exits the building. Kids stare at him. Then, look
      away. Charlie feels very lost until he sees... Sam. She
      smiles. It brings him back instantly. And then, gently...

<b>                             SAM
</b>                Of course.

      The minute she hugs him, the numb goes away. She kisses the
      top of his head and puts her arm around his shoulder. They
      begin walking away.

                debates. You were very sweet, but our
                relationship was too one-sided. I know

      that says, "They forget. I don't." After a beat, Patrick
      comes downstairs. He looks sad with his bruises.

</b>                Hey Craig, Sam will be down soon.

<b>                     CHARLIE
</b>          Maybe.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          So, Lily comes here with this guy Parker.
          And this was going to be the night they
          were going to lose their virginity. So,
          she did it really proper. She packed a
          picnic. Stole a bottle of wine.
          Everything was perfect, and they're just
          about to 'do it' when they realize they
          forgot the condoms. So, what do you
          think happened?

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          I don't know.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          They did it with one of the sandwich
          bags.

They start laughing and screaming.

<b>                     CHARLIE
</b>          Ew!   That's disgusting!

<b>                   PATRICK
</b>          Yes! It is! Let's keep the train
          rolling. Suburban legends. Charlie!

Patrick points to Charlie, who thinks...

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          Uh. Well... there was this girl named
          Second Base Stace. She had boobs in the
          4th grade--

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          Mosquito bites. Promising.     Go.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          And she let some of the boys feel them.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          That's your suburban legend?     Did you at
          least cop a feel?

<b>                     CHARLIE
</b>          No.
<b>                                                            74.
</b>

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          Of course not. You went home, listened
          to "Asleep," wrote a poem about her self-
          esteem--

<b>                      CHARLIE
</b>          Fine!    Okay. Your turn.

Patrick walks over and sits down next to Charlie.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          Yeah, I've got one. Well, there was this
          one guy. Queer as a 3 dollar bill.
          Guy's father didn't know about his son.
          So, he comes down into the basement one
          night when he's supposed to be out of
          town. Catches his son with another boy.
          So, he starts beating him. But not like
          the slap kind. Like the real kind. And
          the boyfriend says, "Stop. You're
          killing him." And the son just yells
          "Get out." And eventually the boyfriend
          just did.

Patrick stops.    Gripped by sad.   He can't shake.

<b>                    PATRICK (CONT'D)
</b>          Why can't you save anybody?

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          I don't know.

<b>                    PATRICK
</b>          Forget it. I'm free now, right? I could
          meet the love of my life any second now.
          Things will be different now, and that's
          good. I just need to meet a good guy.

<b>                       CHARLIE
</b>          Yeah.

Patrick looks at him. Charlie has never seen him so
vulnerable. After a beat... Patrick kisses Charlie on the
mouth. Unsure of what to do, Charlie lets it happen. His
eyes open the whole time. A moment, then Patrick looks at
Charlie. He collapses into his chest.

<b>                       PATRICK
</b>          I'm sorry.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          It's alright.
<b>                                                                      75.

      Charlie holds his friend as Patrick begins to cry. And we
      leave them, the city lights small in the distance.

</b>                He always says he feels free, and tonight
                is his destiny. But after awhile, he
                runs out of things to keep himself numb.

                know it's the last day, but if we could
                just keep it to a dull roar, I'd
                appreciate it.

      The class quiets down.

<b>                          BILL (CONT'D)
</b>                Thank you for such a great year. I had a
                blast. I hope you did, too. And I hope
                you have a great time this summer on your
                vacations. Now, who here is going to be
                reading for pleasure this summer?

      Charlie looks to see if anyone is watching... then, decides
      to raise his hand anyway. Bill is proud.

<b>                          BILL (CONT'D)
</b>                Very good, Charlie. Who else?

      Charlie looks at the Smart Ass Freshman who tormented him all
      year. She sighs. Nothing left to say to him.

      The last kids exit the classroom. Charlie walks down the
      aisle and stands in front of Bill.

</b>                Last day.

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>                Yeah. So, uh, I know it's none of my
                business, but have you decided... are you
                going to New York?

<b>                          BILL
</b>                Well, my wife and I like it here, and I
                think I might be better at teaching than
                writing.

      Charlie is relieved.    Bill is staying.

<b>                          BILL (CONT'D)
</b>                So, uh Charlie... I was thinking maybe I
                could still give you books next year.

<b>                           CHARLIE
</b>                Yeah.   Yeah.

<b>                          BILL
</b>                I think you could write one of them one
                day.

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>                    (fragile belief)
                Really?

<b>                             BILL
</b>                I do.

      Charlie is quiet.   Then...

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>                You're the best teacher I ever had.

<b>                             BILL
</b>                Thank you.

      He gives Bill a shy sideways hug. The two men say nothing
      else. Charlie waves and leaves. Bill smiles to himself.

                sunset. And just a few hours before,
                everyone I love had their last day of
                high school ever. And I was happy
                because they were happy, even though I
                counted, and I have 1,095 days to go.

      Prom night. Charlie sees Candace posing for Dad's camera.
      For a moment, we think Candace went to prom with Derek.

      As mom and dad move out of the way, we realize Candace is
      standing with her 3 best girlfriends. They look beautiful.

</b>                My sister finally decided to break up

      Prom night continues. The antique limo is so garish, it's
      great. Charlie snaps pictures with Sam's mom and Patrick's
      dad. Mary Elizabeth is with her boyfriend, Peter. Alice
      stands with Patrick, dashing in his Mod Suit Tux.

<b>                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>                And then there was Sam...

      The image moves to the front of the house, where Sam emerges.
      She wears a vintage flapper dress from the 20's. Radiant.

</b>                I've looked at her pictures since that
                night. I like to see how happy she was
                before she knew.

      Sam joins Craig. They kiss for the cameras, then run with
      the rest of the gang to the limosine.

<b>                          CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

                when the truth came out...

      The gang poses for more pictures in front of the limo.

</b>                Basically, Craig has been cheating on Sam
                the whole time. When I heard that, I
                kept thinking about the happy girl in
                these pictures. Because she doesn't have
                1,095 days to go.

      The pictures are down. The dressers empty. The suitcase is
      open on the bed. Charlie watches Sam fold clothes and put
      them in her suitcase. He has promised himself he will not
      cry. Even when she packs away his Beatles 45 of "Something."

      Instead, he looks at her and tries to remember every detail.
      Her hair and brown eyes and sound of her voice.

<b>                          SAM
</b>                Thanks for staying up with me.

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>                Sure. My brother said Penn State has a
                restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner.
                You have to get a grilled stickie on your
                first night. It's a tradition.

<b>                          SAM
</b>                That sounds like fun.

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>                Yeah. Pretty soon, you'll have a whole
                new group of friends, and you won't even
                think about this place anymore.

<b>                          SAM
</b>                Yes, I will.

      Sam moves some suitcases over to the pile in the room.   They
      stand next to each other. Close.

<b>                          SAM
</b>                He said he was sorry, and that I was
                right to break up with him. But I'm
                driving away, and I just felt so small.
                Just asking myself why do I and everyone
                I love pick people who treat us like
                we're nothing?

</b>                We accept the love we think we deserve.

      He says it sober. Without judgement. Sam lets it sink in.
      Charlie walks over to the bed to do more packing. Then, she
      turns to him.

<b>                       SAM
</b>             Then, why didn't you ever ask me out?

Charlie didn't expect that.       He is silent.   Heart pounding.

<b>                       CHARLIE
</b>             I, uh, I just didn't think you wanted
             that.

</b>             Don't you get it, Charlie? I can't feel
             that. It's really sweet and everything,
             but you can't just sit there and put
             everybody's lives ahead of yours and
             think that counts as love. I don't want
             to be somebody's crush. I want people to
             like the real me.

<b>                       CHARLIE
</b>             I know who you are, Sam.

Sam waits.    And Charlie finally speaks from the heart.

<b>                       CHARLIE (CONT'D)
</b>             I know I'm quiet, and I know I should
             speak more, but if you knew the things
             that were in my head most of the time,
             you'd know what it really meant. How
             much we are alike. And how we've been
             through the same things. And you're not
             small. You're beautiful.

He can't contain himself anymore. He moves to her and kisses
her. They stand. Move to the bed. Kissing. Charlie's
heart pounds. They sit on the bed. Still kissing.

We see her fingertips. Her hand on Charlie's knee. When she
touches him, Charlie pulls away from her. Shocked. Like
he's seen a ghost. It hits Charlie like freezing water.

      After a moment, Sam climbs into the driver's seat of her

      Sam's bedroom. And it is not Sam touching Charlie. But...

      Aunt Helen

      The memory only registers as a small blink of his eye.
      Charlie sees his friends are crying. He's not. He's numb.

      Charlie walks down the street. His eyes far away. The
      images and memories are short, violent bursts. If you've
      never had an anxiety attack, this is how it feels.

      BACK TO PRESENT. Charlie walks toward us on the sidewalk.
      We see him through a long lens. His image fractures. We see
      him in different planes of the image. He's beginning to
      break apart. One image. Two images.

      same house 8 years later. Banging his head against the wall.
      "It's my fault. It's all my fault."

      He passes the photo wall on the stairs. We see the images of
      the family. Church. Communion. Baby pictures. Years of
      history staring at us. Ghosts on the wall.

      Elizabeth and Alice. And worst of all... Sam and Patrick the

      cafeteria erupts into violence.

      And Charlie remembers what he's blacked out.

      We see him in the cafeteria. Terrifying. He thinks he sees
      Aunt Helen as he breaks the Linebacker's nose. Hits another
      in the throat. And pushes another. Charlie looks at his
      hand, covered in blood. The whole school staring at him.

      the pictures back in his brain. But he can't. They keep
      coming and coming, faster and faster. Sam's hand, Little
      Charlie on top of the stairs, the police telling him Aunt
      Helen is dead.

<b>                          CHARLIE (V.O.)

                   She died getting my birthday present, so
                   I guess I killed her, right? I've tried
                   to stop thinking that, but I can't. She
                   keeps driving away and dying over and
                   over.

      Candace looks like she got hit with ice water. She knows her
      brother. She knows this voice. Candace covers the phone.

      hall. The empty bedroom. Charlie's typewriter on his desk.

      anymore.   The past and present have bled together.

      kitchen. BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old Charlie stands in
      the same kitchen, breathing shallow.

      QUICK FLASH. 7 year old Charlie walks up to Aunt Helen
      sitting at the kitchen table. BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old
      Charlie begins to have a full blown anxiety attack.

      QUICK FLASH. 7 year old Charlie takes Aunt Helen's hand and
      turns it over... to reveal her wrist scars.

      BACK TO PRESENT as Charlie looks from the table to the
      counter with the bread and the KNIVES. He stares at the
      knives for a moment. Just as...

      The Policemen break down the door.

      We see Charlie's reflection in the window. The door opens
      slowly, and his psychiatrist, Dr. Burton, enters. She finds
      him sitting in the corner. He has been crying.

<b>                            DR. BURTON
</b>                 Charlie?   I'm Dr. Burton.

<b>                            CHARLIE
</b>                 You have to let me go.    My dad can't

<b>                    CHARLIE

          tell me how to stop it.

<b>                    DR. BURTON
</b>          Seeing what, Charlie?

Charlie breaks.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          There is so much pain.    And I don't know
          how to not notice it.

<b>                    CHARLIE
</b>          No! Not me. It's them. It's everyone.
          It never stops. Do you understand?

Dr. Burton smiles, sympathetic. Charlie nods, relieved that
someone finally understands. Until...

<b>                    DR. BURTON
</b>          What about your Aunt Helen?

Like cold water. What was tears is now confusion and soon to
be shame. Dr. Burton is gentle to him.

</b>                She was... insane.

      The minute he says one word of truth, he feels ashamed. He
      stops talking. Dr. Burton does not press him. Not today.

<b>                          DR. BURTON
</b>                Charlie, are you going to let me help you

      outside. The intercom is quiet. Charlie is alone. He looks

                go from there. I know it's not all the

      After they say "Amen," the room falls silent. The family is
      on pins and needles. No one touches their food. Until...

<b>                             CHARLIE
</b>                   How do you think the Penguins are going
                   to do this year, dad?

<b>                             FATHER
</b>                   God damn Penguins. I think they're
                   allergic to God damn defense.

<b>                             CHARLIE
</b>                   What do the players call a puck again?

<b>                                FATHER
</b>                   A biscuit.

<b>                             CANDACE
</b>                   Are you sure it's not a "God damn
                   biscuit?"

<b>                             FATHER
</b>                   You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.

      As things return to normal, dad picks up his paper. Candace
      talks about the books she'll need for college. Everyone
      starts eating. And Charlie smiles, happy to just be home.

      Ding dong.    The door opens to reveal Patrick, smiling.

<b>                             PATRICK
</b>                   Can Charlie come out and play?

      Charlie's mother smiles. Charlie smiles, too. Especially
      when he sees... Sam. Standing next to Patrick. Her hair a
      little different. Her eyes alive and happy.

<b>182   INT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT                          182
</b>
      The gang of three sit at their booth. Sam and Patrick have
      their coffee. Charlie has his brownie. Like always.

<b>                             SAM
</b>                   That first night, I had grilled stickies.
                   It was so good. You have to visit in the
                   Fall. We'll have some. Okay?
<b>                                                                      93.
</b>

<b>                          CHARLIE
</b>                Definitely.

<b>                          PATRICK
</b>                Sorry, Sam. Charlie has a breakdown
                scheduled for October.

      Charlie laughs.   Sam smiles.   After a beat...

<b>                          SAM
</b>                Well, can I tell you something? I've
                been away for two months. It's another
                world. And it gets better.
                    (off Charlie's smile)
                And my roommate Katie has the best taste
                in music.

      Sam puts a cassette tape down on the table.

<b>                          SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                I found the tunnel song.

      Charlie looks at Sam and Patrick, who smile.

<b>                          SAM (CONT'D)
</b>                Let's drive.

<b>183   EXT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT                            183
</b>
      The three leave the restaurant and jump into Sam's truck.
      Patrick drives. Charlie in the middle. Sam the passenger.

<b>                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>                I don't know if I will have the time to
                write any more letters because I might be
                too busy trying to participate. So, if
                this does end up being the last letter, I
                just want you to know that I was in a bad
                place before I started high school. And
                you helped me.

<b>184   INT. SAM'S TRUCK - NIGHT                                        184
</b>
      The three friends are flying down the highway in Sam's truck.
      The music blaring. The wind making their hair dance.

<b>                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>                Even if you didn't know what I was
                talking about. Or know someone who's
                gone through it. It made me not feel
                alone.

      With Sam's help, Charlie climbs through the little window
<b>                                                                       94.
</b>

<b>185   EXT. HIGHWAY 376 NORTH - NIGHT                                   185
</b>
      Charlie gets into the back of the truck. He sits down,
      looking back at the highway. Watching everywhere he's been.

<b>                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>                Because I know there are people who say
                all of these things don't happen. And
                there are people who forget what it's
                like to be 16 when they turn 17.

      We see Charlie in profile.   The night sky behind him until...

<b>186   INT. FORT PITT TUNNEL - NIGHT                                    186
</b>
      ... they enter the tunnel, and we realize just how fast
      they're driving. The white tiles of the tunnel whiz by at
      blinding speed. A perfect night. A perfect drive. Flying.

<b>                          CHARLIE (V.O.)
</b>                I know these will all be stories someday.
                And our pictures will become old
                photographs. And we'll all become
                somebody's mom or dad. But right now,
                these moments are not stories.

      Charlie turns to face forward. To the moment.   To Sam,
      smiling at him from the front seat.

<b>                          CHARLIE (V.O) (CONT'D)
</b>                This is happening. I am here. And I am
                looking at her. And she is so beautiful.

      Sam kisses Charlie. Then, she turns, and all three kids look
      ahead to everything in front of them. Charlie begins to
      stand in the back of the truck. Ready to leave the tunnel.

<b>                          CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>                I can see it. This one moment when you
                know you're not a sad story. You are
                alive. And as you stand up and see the
                lights on buildings and everything that
                makes you wonder. And you are listening
                to that song on that drive with the
                people you love most in this world.

      Charlie stands in the back of the truck.   The wind on his
      face. He is free.

<b>                          CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>                And in this moment, I swear...
<b>                                                               95.
</b>

We see the moment as Charlie sees it. The tunnel's exit
getting bigger and brighter with the lights of the city
behind it.

<b>                    CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          ... we are infinite.

The tunnel song blasts over the speakers as the truck flies
out of the tunnel. Sam and Patrick scream with excitement.
Charlie holds his arms in the air. The weight of the world
gone. If only for a moment. This one moment. We see the
city. A million lights like white stars in a glass dome. We
crane to the sky. We are in Heaven.
