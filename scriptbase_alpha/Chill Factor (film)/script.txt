SCENE
  EXT. JUNGLE/TEST SITE - HORN ISLAND, 
SOUTH PACIFIC - 1977- DAY.


BRYNNER
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to 
close up shop and be ready to move up the 
island by night-...

BRYNNER
(off) ...-fall.

HEMMINGS
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--

BRYNNER
(off) (interrupting) But...

BRYNNER
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the 
loading dock for a few hours without 
coming back to find a major...

BRYNNER
(off) ...screwup?

HEMMINGS
Uh, with all due respect, sir, Dr. Long 
told me to prep the field for detonation 
at...

HEMMINGS
...noon.

BRYNNER
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery 
slope here, Sam.  A covert military 
operation riddled with civilian...

BRYNNER
(off) ...scientists.

HEMMINGS
You don't think it's that bad, do you, 
sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two 
years developing his defoliant.  The 
stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.

BRYNNER
Where's their protective...

BRYNNER
(off) ...gear?

HEMMINGS
(off) It's a hundred degrees...

HEMMINGS
...out here, captain.  Don't you think 
the guys deserve a break?

BRYNNER
They'll get a break tomorrow.

BRYNNER
We're not gonna take chances on our last 
day.

TELSTAR
(off) ...doc.  What's up?

TELSTAR
I thought we wrapped the tests yes-...

TELSTAR
(face off) ...-terday.  Captain Brynner 
is...

TELSTAR
...gonna shit if he finds out we haven't 
closed up...

TELSTAR
(face off) ...shop.

LONG
I had something of an epiphany this 
morning, Telstar.  I eliminated the 
binary shell and I grafted the cobalt ion 
to the other side of the molecule.  I 
think it might give us a significantly 
more rapid chemical ignition.

TELSTAR
It better.

SWEENEY
(grunts)

LONG
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?

SWEENEY
Well, (clears throat) Costello's finished 
with the stability profile, but Abbott is 
still chewing on the load file.

LONG
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.

SWEENEY
Well, your prediction was on the nose.

LONG
How much longer for the range and power 
projections?

SWEENEY
(sighs) (raspberries) I don't know.  Um, 
he's working, but there's a lot of data.  
Maybe...another hour?

LONG
We don't have an hour.  We're already 
supposed to be shut down.

BRYNNER

BRYNNER
What the hell is all this about a 
detonation today?  We're scheduled...

BRYNNER
...to be off the island tonight.

LONG
And I changed the schedule.

LONG
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.

BRYNNER
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer 
confirmation?

LONG
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so 
much of your career questioning your 
superiors, you might've found yourself 
with more gold leaf on your col-...

Long.  You may be in charge here, but

LONG
Look, this is a scientific experiment, 
okay?

LONG
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon 
will go up along with mine.  I don't 
think I need to mention you could use the 
help.

BRYNNER
The NSA thinks the UN is onto your 
work...

BRYNNER
...here, and the White House is screaming 
about chemical weapons, (face off) and 
we're...

BRYNNER
...sittin' here with our hands in the 
goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you 
something else.  I didn't join the 
service to let people like you turn...

BRYNNER
...the United States into the kind of 
country we're supposed to be fighting 
against.

LONG
(overlapping) But you have no choice but 
to follow orders.

LONG
Now listen to me.

LONG
Now, I know.  You have moral objections 
to what we're doing here, but believe...

LONG
...me, if I thought there was any real 
danger, I-I wouldn't go forward.

LONG
You have my word on that.

BRYNNER
(sighs) (whispering) All right. (in 
normal voice) One more shot, provided... 
(sighs) we're off the island tonight.

LONG
Let's proceed.

BRYNNER
(interrupting) There's nothing to say, 
doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, 
and they still need you, whereas...I've 
never been anything more than a thorn in

MASON
(grunts)

MASON
Been trying to figure out your secret.

LONG
My secret?

MASON
Yeah.  Ten months we've been fishin' this 
river together.  We use the same 
equipment, more or less...

MASON
(off) ...but you pull twice as many fish 
out of the water as I do.

MASON
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it 
since I was a kid.  But you, I don't 
know.  Somehow you think...

MASON
(off) ...like a fish.

LONG
(chuckles) (chuckling) No, that's not 
possible, Mason.  The trout... (grunts)

LONG
(off) ...is a perfect hunter.

LONG
(off) He's brains without ambition...

LONG
...sensitivity without neurosis.  He's...

LONG
(off) ...the master of his realm.

LONG
(face off) How can we ever hope to win 
against the trout?

LONG
There's only one way you can do it, 
Mason.

LONG
(off) Turn the power of the hunter 
against him.

LONG
Tie a fly...

LONG
(off) ...create a piece of bait that 
sends the fish's instincts into 
overdrive...

LONG
...forcing him to strike.  And only then 
does our noble friend realize that the 
prey...can bite...

LONG
(face off) ...back...

LONG
...and that power...

LONG
(face off) ...without caution...

LONG
...is death.

MASON
Some people might say you're readin' an 
awful lot in-...

But I don't think you would.

DARLENE
(off) ...-son.  Of all the days for you 
to show up late. (sighs) First, the idiot 
April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad 
tooth...

DARLENE
...and then my night man shows up when he 
feels like...

DARLENE
...it.

MASON
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked 
late for you this mornin', and you didn't 
wanna spring for over-...

MASON
(face off) ...-time, (off) remember?

DARLENE
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the 
dentist be-...

DARLENE
...-fore he closes, which means you're 
gonna have to cover the grill and the 
floor.

MASON
I can handle it.

DARLENE
Mm.  It doesn't take a genius.

DARLENE
(sighs) How'd we do today, doc?

LONG
(sighs) Oh, caught a few, lost a few.

DARLENE
(chuckles) Story of my life. (sighing) 
Well, one thing you won't lose is that 
friend of yours back there, I'll tell you 
that.

LONG
Oh, no?

DARLENE
Oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  Oh, he 
may not have your sheepskins, and...

DARLENE
(off) ...well, most of the time he looks 
like something the cat might have dragged 
in, but, you know...

DARLENE
...he's smart enough to get you...

DARLENE
(off) ...somehow. (chuckles - continues 
under following scene)

DARLENE
There's something else too.

LONG
Uh, we both like to fish.

DARLENE
(grunts) Secrets.

LONG
Ah.

DARLENE
His I know.  Yours I don't have a clue. 
(grunts) But if it wasn't for you, I 
think he'd have drifted right on through 
this town.

DARLENE
(chuckles)

LONG
You know, I have yet to get a simple cup 
of coffee and a meal in this place, 
Darlene.

DARLENE
And you ain't gonna start now.

DARLENE
Ma-...

DARLENE
(off) ...-son!

MASON
Yeah?

DARLENE
Be sure you feed Bosco.

DARLENE
And don't give him any ice cream...

DARLENE
(off) ...like April.  It gives him gas.  
And make sure there's (on) two pots of 
coffee...

MASON
(off) (overlapping) Two pots of coffee...

DARLENE
(off) ...ready before the morning crowd 
blows in.

MASON
(off) (overlapping) ...ready before the 
morning crowd blows in.  I got it...

MASON
(off) ...Darlene.

LONG

BRYNNER
(face off) Is this stool taken?

No, go--

BRYNNER
You look good, Richard.

BRYNNER
You look fit...healthy...

BRYNNER
...not at all like a man responsible for 
the deaths of eighteen peo-...

BRYNNER
(off) ...-ple.

LONG
Is that why you're here?  To blame...

LONG
(off) ...me?  Well, you could've saved 
yourself the trip.

LONG
I know where the (chuckling) blame 
belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, 
Andrew.  The government did...

LONG
...that.

BRYNNER
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government 
did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just 
come to say how grateful I am to you...

BRYNNER
(off) ...and the government.

LONG
Grateful?

BRYNNER
(off) Mm-hm.

BRYNNER
Together, you gave me the opportunity to 
realize just how very wrong my life had 
gone.

BRYNNER
(off) Do you remember telling me once 
that all through my career, I'd never fit 
in?  Well...

BRYNNER
...you were right, of course.  But 
after...

BRYNNER
(off) ...years of thinking the matter 
over, I began to see that the whole thing 
wasn't really my problem.

BRYNNER
What rational man could fit in with the 
sorts of things our government was doing?  
The sorts of things you've...

BRYNNER
(off) ...always done, Richard?

LONG
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of 
those...

LONG
(off) ...men every time I've closed my 
eyes?  But after you went away, I--

BRYNNER
(interrupting) Went away? (chuckles - 
continues under following scene)

BRYNNER
(off) "Went away."  I like that.

BRYNNER
Almost quaint.

LONG
All right.  After they put you away...

LONG
...I began trying to find ways of 
controlling the effects of the weapon 
that we tested on Horn Island.

BRYNNER
And let me guess.  You failed.

LONG
So far, ye-yes.

BRYNNER
Why is it you scientists can create 
implements of destruction...

BRYNNER
(off) ...so quickly, but when it comes to 
cures and benefits, your...

BRYNNER
...speed is nothing short of glacial?

BRYNNER
(off) Though at least you're trying, 
Richard.  And if the road to hell is 
paved with good intentions...

BRYNNER
...we know you'll find your way there 
quickly.

BRYNNER
(off) And don't worry.

BRYNNER
It's not such a bad place.  I should 
know, after all.

Seein' that we both have so much love...

Why don't I--?

Wait.

Pleasant surprise.

I can't say it's a surprise.

VITELLI

VITELLI
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the

And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me.  
Get your men and your machines off my

It's not over, Brynner.

GOMEZ
Sir, we can't just let him get away with 
this!

VITELLI
(overlapping) Gomez, you fight the 
battles you can win.  Now, we've been 
outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move 
is gonna be to get Elvis out of the 
country and sell him to the highest 
bidder.  To do that, he has to have 
planned an exit point.  That's where we 
intercept him.  That's where we make our 
play.  Now you and your men back off.
